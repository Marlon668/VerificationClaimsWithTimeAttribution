pomt-00543	Says Hillary Clinton "insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs ‘have to be changed.’ "	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/jun/17/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-hillary-clinton-said-progressive-age/	As he tries to appeal to religious conservatives, Jeb Bush has portrayed Hillary Clinton as the enemy of those who believe in religious freedom. "These have been rough years for religious charities and their right of conscience, and the leading Democratic candidate hinted of more to come," Bush said during his announcement speech at Miami Dade College on June 15. "Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs ‘have to be changed.’ That is what she said. That is what she said. And I guess we should at least thank her for the warning." So is that what she actually said about the need for religious beliefs to change? We looked at when and where she made her comments, and found Bush is taking her words out of context. Clinton’s Women in the World speech A spokesman for Bush confirmed that he was referring to a comment Clinton made during her speech at the Women in the World Summit in New York City on April 23. (And he’s attacked her speech previously.) In the section Bush referred to, Clinton raised concerns about lack of access to education for girls, the rate of maternal mortality and domestic violence, and reproductive health care. It’s in that context she made the claim about religion: "Yes, we’ve nearly closed the global gender gap in primary school, but secondary school remains out of reach for so many girls around the world. Yes, we’ve increased the number of countries prohibiting domestic violence, but still more than half the nations in the world have no such laws on the books, and an estimated one in three women still experience violence. Yes, we’ve cut the maternal mortality rate in half, but far too many women are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe childbirth. All the laws we’ve passed don’t count for much if they’re not enforced. Rights have to exist in practice, not just on paper. Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed. As I have said and as I believe, the advancement of the full participation of women and girls at every aspect of their societies is the great unfinished business of the 21st century, and not just for women but for everyone — and not just in far away countries but right here in the United States." Bush’s campaign referred to news articles about her speech including one in New York magazine which stated "the speech had other double meanings that show fiery rhetoric geared toward a group of mostly progressive women." The headlines from conservative media that we found such as Fox News focused on abortion: "Hillary: ‘Religious beliefs’ must change for sake of abortion." Clinton, who is a supporter of abortion rights, didn’t use the word abortion, but she did mention "reproductive health care," which can include abortion as well as birth control or prenatal health care. But her statement is somewhat different from Bush’s claim. She didn’t say that a "progressive agenda" should dictate religious beliefs -- her overall point was that countries need to do more to help protect women’s rights to education, health care, and to live safely -- and that to do so requires enforcing laws and changing religious beliefs. Clinton’s speech didn’t only pertain to far flung countries -- she was making a statement to religious conservatives in the United States. "America moves forward when all women are guaranteed the right to make their own health care choices, not when those choices are taken away by an employer like Hobby Lobby," she said. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that certain companies with religious objections can opt out of a mandate under the Affordable Care Act to provide free contraception to their employees. "One would like to imagine that Clinton was speaking only about primitive cultures where children are forced into marriage and childbearing, or where genital cutting is common," wrote Kathleen Parker, a conservative columnist for the Washington Post. "But we know that she also meant religious conservatives closer to home whose beliefs get in the way. She explicitly criticized Hobby Lobby for not paying for its employees’ contraception." Clinton’s spokesman told PolitiFact that Bush took her remarks out of context. "Hillary Clinton was talking about atrocities and horrible practices around the world that are carried out against women and girls in the name of deep-seated cultural codes and religious beliefs," Josh Schwerin said. "If any candidate thinks rape, child marriage and genital mutilation -- done in the name of deeply held religious beliefs -- should be allowed to continue, they should say so directly and not try to make it into a false political attack." Our ruling Bush said, "Secretary Clinton insists that when the progressive agenda encounters religious beliefs to the contrary, those beliefs ‘have to be changed.’ " During a speech about women’s rights worldwide in April, Clinton talked about the rates of maternal mortality, domestic violence, lack of access to education and "reproductive health care." She said that laws must be enforced to protect those rights "and deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed." So the only area where she says beliefs must change that has any possible connection to domestic issues is in the reference to the overall category of reproductive health. Bush is making Clinton’s remarks sound far more sweeping than they actually are. Clinton was talking about specific issues affecting women’s health and safety, in both a global and domestic context.

pomt-09234	On the Arizona immigration law.	half flip	/florida/statements/2010/may/12/marco-rubio/marco-rubios-position-arizona-immigration-law/	With controversy swirling around Arizona's new hard-line immigration law, U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio if often asked about the bill. But his answers have seemed inconsistent. We decided to put his comments to our Flip-O-Meter. The law, generally speaking, makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. On April 27, 2010 in front of a largely Cuban-American crowd in West Miami, Rubio likened Arizona's bill to the creation of a "police state," saying the American people wouldn't be comfortable with people being required to have documents on them at all times proving their citizenship status. Then on April 30, he told Fox News' Neil Cavuto that didn't believe the Arizona law was "the best answer to that problem." But in an interview with a conservative blogger nine days later, Rubio said he would've voted for the measure. The seeming flip, the Rubio campaign contends, is because of late changes inserted into the immigration bill. "Marco's position has been consistent," campaign spokesman Alex Burgos said. "It's the law that has changed since his first comments on it.'' Let's check it out. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What Rubio said on April 27 in West Miami "I think the law has potential unintended consequences and it's one of the reasons why I think immigration needs to be a federal issue, not a state one.' "Everyone is concerned with the prospect of the reasonable suspicious provisions where individuals could be pulled over because someone suspects they may not be legal in this country. I think over time people will grow uncomfortable with that ... I've always said I think the ultimate solution is to create a technologically based system where employers can verify the eligibility of the folks they are employing." When Rubio was asked specifically about immigrants being required to produce documents at a moment's notice, the son of Cuban exiles said, according to the Miami Herald, "That's not really something that Americans are comfortable with, the notion of a police state.'' What Rubio said on Fox News April 30 "I don't believe that law is the best answer to that problem." Later, Rubio said, "There are portions of the law that over time may lead to unintended consequences." What Rubio said to a Human Events reporter in a story published May 6 "Understand that what Arizona is facing is different from anything Florida has ever faced," Rubio told Human Events' Jason Mattera. "Arizona has a physical border with Mexico. And there (are) kidnappings, human trafficking, drug wars coming across that border into an American city. Frankly, very few states in the country can imagine what that’s like." Human Events, a conservative publication, asked if Rubio were in the Arizona Legislature, would he have voted for the law? "The second (version) that passed hit the right note. Yes," Rubio responded. The interviewer then asked about the first version. "Well, I would have wanted to see changes like the ones that were made because I know that that’s not the intent of the bill." ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PolitiFact has thoroughly explored the Arizona immigration bill and the changes inserted in the final days of the regular session of the Arizona Legislature. We rated two claims after the first version of the bill passed and another two claims after the second version passed. The original version of the bill was signed into law by Republican Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on April 23. One of the key questions to emerge during and after its passage has been what standard law enforcement officers will need before questioning individuals about their immigration status. Drawing special attention is the role played by "racial profiling" -- that is, the use of racial or ethnic characteristics as a justification for police questioning. Critics had said that the original version of the law permitted racial profiling. But changes signed by Brewer on April 30 were intended to blunt those charges. The new version of the law says: "A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution." The prior version had said that an official "may not solely consider race" in such circumstances. Rubio, in his comments in West Miami, said he was particularly concerned about under what circumstances law enforcement officials in Arizona could stop people to inquire about their citizenship status. He said the changes in the bill had quelled those concerns. "I mean no one is in favor of a bill that would force American citizens to have to interact with law enforcement in a way that wasn’t appropriate," Rubio said in the Human Events interview. "And the first bill I thought held that door open. Since then, the changes that have been made to the bill I think greatly improve it." But legal scholars say the door to some form of racial profiling remains open despite the changes in the law. Specifically, there is Supreme Court precedent for allowing racial profiling under similar circumstances to those envisioned in the Arizona law. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1975 ruled in United States vs. Brignoni-Ponce that U.S. Border Patrol could stop and question people in vehicles about their immigration status based solely on their appearance. In a 9-0 decision, the court ruled that "because of the important governmental interest in preventing the illegal entry of aliens at the border, the minimal intrusion of a brief stop, and the absence of practical alternatives for policing the border, an officer, whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country, may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain suspicious circumstances; but any further detention or search must be based on consent or probable cause." The Supreme Court decision seems to conflict with the Arizona law, and a separate federal appeals court that covers Arizona, and is likely to set up a legal fight. There's also a provision of the law that requires legal immigrants to carry documents confirming their legal status. Rubio was concerned about that in his comments in West Miami April 27. When asked specifically about immigrants having to carry documents on them, Rubio said "That's not really something that Americans are comfortable with, the notion of a police state." That part of the law, however, was not stripped out in the amended version. The Mexican government already has issued a travel alert to their citizens, directing them to use extreme caution if visiting Arizona. And the cities of Flagstaff and Tucson have said they will sue to challenge the new law, which could go into effect in July or August. The bill has been criticized by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: "I think it creates unintended consequences,” he told Politico. “It's difficult for me to imagine how you're going to enforce this law. It places a significant burden on local law enforcement and you have civil liberties issues that are significant as well.” We also should note that the changes, though made to sway critics of the original bill, did little to alter the vote totals in the Arizona Legislature. In fact, no one in the 60-member state House or the 30-member Senate voted against the first version of the immigration bill and in favor of the replacement bill. Rubio has suggested he would have voted against the first version of the bill, equating it to a "police state," and said he would have voted for the second bill. That would have made him an anomaly in the Arizona Legislature. Rubio has outlined two basic concerns about the bill -- the possibility of racial profiling and the fact that people would be required to produce immigration documents at a moments notice. He has explained that his remarks changed because he was satisfied with the altered bill. That indeed is supported by the changes in the bill on the possibility of racial profiling, but it still does not explain his concerns on producing documents and the risk of a "police state," because it is not addressed by the revised bill. So we rate his change a Half Flip.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-05-12T16:51:43	2010-05-06	['Arizona']

The fact that it came from a website, National Report, known for Onion-like satire, didn’t stop some bloggers from reporting it as news. The piece was packed with fake details designed to press anti-Muslim buttons: President Barack Obama held a news conference to make his declaration. He said Muslims "are not all bad. In fact, most of them are good." His announcement was hailed by a "member of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party." He said he would work with Congress to make it easier for Muslims to earn U.S. citizenship. "Mr. Matei of the Muslim Brotherhood assured me they want to come to this country to help us, not harm us," he was reported to say. Following other attempts to paint Obama as a Muslim -- such as this one that we rated Pants on Fire -- the National Report’s gambit worked. "How dare Obama declare November, the month when we give thanks to God for our blessings and great nation, National Muslim Appreciation Month!" wrote a blogger for Tea Party Nation. The PolitiFact inbox saw email after email with links to such stories from readers who got it from outraged friends. Urban-legend debunker Snopes.com quickly confirmed that it originated with National Report. The headline was utterly invented, and the event was entirely fabricated. While we didn’t hear back from the White House, we found no evidence of any such proclamation at the White House website. We also asked Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "I’m fairly certain they haven’t. Otherwise, I would have heard about it," he said. Obama regularly commemorates Muslim holidays alongside Christian and Jewish ones. He’s proclaimed a Jewish American Heritage Month, a National Day of Prayer and a Religious Freedom Day, noting, "We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, Sikhs and non-believers." He has declared heritage months for Irish-Americans, Asian-Americans, Caribbean-Americans and Hispanics. He has proclaimed a month for appreciation of African-American music. But nothing about Muslims. As for Obama’s purported proclamation, the Tea Party Nation blogger posted an update to her outrage: "Just found out this article was a hoax. They sure fooled me. However, my comments still stand if O should ever do such a thing." Our ruling Bloggers posted a claim that the president had declared November "National Muslim Appreciation Month."

pomt-11457	California’s single-payer healthcare proposal would "force seniors off of Medicare."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/mar/08/antonio-villaraigosa/villaraigosas-claim-sb-562-will-force-seniors-medi/	Would seniors in California really be forced off Medicare by the single-payer health plan backed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom? That’s the allegation from former Los Angeles Mayor and fellow Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa, Newsom’s top rival in the crowded gubernatorial campaign. Two other Democrats and two Republicans are also vying to succeed termed-out Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018. At issue is Healthy California, or Senate Bill 562, introduced last year by Democratic State Sen. Ricardo Lara. It would establish one central government health insurance provider to cover all Californians. Supporters say the plan would save money by eliminating the need for private insurance and reduce prescription drug costs. But even some who back the idea question how the key details will work, including how to pay for it. The bill passed the State Senate last year but was shelved in the Assembly, where Speaker Anthony Rendon called it "woefully incomplete." Heated issue Despite stalling out, the plan has become among the most debated issues in the governor’s race. Newsom has offered support for SB 562, though he’s been nuanced about it. He has been attacked by other Democratic gubernatorial candidates, chiefly Villaraigosa, for backing a proposal that’s still light on details. In turn, the California Nurses Association and National Nurses United, which supports Newsom, has called Villaraigosa’s claims "fear mongering" and "disgracefully intended to alarm seniors about their Medicare coverage." Here’s Villaraigosa’s claim about the plan in a March 5, 2018 press release: "Newsom calls any attempt to demand details of his $200 billion tax increase and plan to force seniors off of Medicare as ‘defeatist.’ I call refusing to say how you will successfully persuade Californians to more than double their taxes while taking away their Medicare simply deceptive." This is not the first time Villaraigosa has made some version of the claim, and lumped Newsom in with it. "Seniors have earned the right to Medicare as we know it. We should start the discussion with protecting this effective single-payer system, not with the Newsomcare plan to demolish it," Villaraigosa said in a campaign email on Jan. 25, 2018. Villaraigosa again criticized SB 562 at a gubernatorial candidates forum in Sacramento on March 8, 2018, saying: "It would end Medicare as we know it. … Everybody that has an insurance program would be off of it." Villaraigosa added that he still favors a single-payer system "in concept," just not this specific bill. In this fact check, we focused on Villaraigosa’s claim the plan would force seniors off Medicare. We’ll save an examination of whether the plan is really a $200 billion tax increase for another time. Visit PolitiFact California's Tracking the Truth series here to see all of our 2018 governor's race fact-checks. Our research Health policy experts told us there’s a lot of uncertainty about what the single-payer proposal will do, if it’s ever passed. They said Villaraigosa’s statement is accurate to a point, but also leaves out much of the story. The text of the bill says it would honor the rules and benefits of federal health plans such as Medicare, which covers more than 5 million Californians. "I think it is correct to say that the bill aspires to fold Medicare into the California single payer, Healthy California," Joy Melnikow, director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, said in an email. Laurence Baker, professor of health research and policy at Stanford University, added: "It’s probably technically correct to say it (SB 562) intends to get rid of Medicare. It’s also fair to say we don’t know what it would be replaced with." Partially true? Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, agreed there’s some truth to Villaraigosa’s claim. "I would rate this assertion by Villaraigosa as partially true. SB 562 would replace Medicare with a more comprehensive state program that would make Medicare beneficiaries better off, because it would be more inclusive than Medicare, and dramatically reduce out-of-pocket payments for supplement insurance and deductibles and copayments. The press release uses negative language to describe this change, which in my opinion is misleading," Kominski said in an email. All three expressed a degree of skepticism that the federal government would allow California to incorporate Medicare recipients into a statewide single-payer plan. "Whether a federal waiver would be granted to do this is speculative," Melnikow wrote. Evidence from Villaraigosa We asked Villaraigosa’s campaign for evidence supporting the claim. A spokesman responded with links to news articles that describe the plan and issued the following statement, which adds a bit more detail than the initial claim that caught our attention: "Under SB 562, California seniors would no longer receive healthcare through Medicare. All federal funds currently going towards Medicare beneficiaries in California will be redirected to an unknown, state-run plan." Villaraigosa has challenged Newsom to an in-depth debate on the single-payer proposal. Response from Newsom In a statement, Newsom’s spokesman rejected the idea that the candidate supports any plan that would harm Medicare coverage: "It’s outright fiction to suggest Gavin Newsom would ever advocate for a reduction in Medicare coverage. He will never support a bill that ends Medicare for anyone -- full stop. Gavin strongly believes we need to double down on Medicare in California and was the first candidate in this race to support a federal Medicare for All bill. Under a Newsom state health plan, anyone eligible for Medicare would keep their Medicare, and Gavin will fight hard to guarantee comprehensive health care for anyone not covered under Medicare." Newsom’s spokesman added that the lieutenant governor supports SB 562 moving through the legislative process, noting that changes will take place as it advances. The bill’s author, State Sen. Ricardo Lara, said SB 562 would "equal or exceed the coverage" of Medicare and other federal healthcare programs, through his spokesman. Our ruling Candidate for governor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed a single-payer health plan backed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom would force seniors off Medicare. That plan, also known as SB 562 or Healthy California, proposes to create one central government health insurance provider in the state by folding in all other plans, including federal coverage such as Medicare. So, in this sense, Villaraigosa has a point. If successful, the plan would eliminate Medicare in the state and create a brand new, untested system. Villaraigosa’s claim, however, ignores the fact that the single-payer proposal at least intends to honor all rules and benefits under Medicare and improve upon the system. His statement gives the impression that seniors would be forced off Medicare and left without healthcare, which is far from the plan’s stated goal. Notably, California would need federal approval to bring Medicare and other federal plans into its new system. Experts say this approval is, at best, a long-shot. Newsom, the frontrunner in the race for governor, has expressed support for SB 562, though he’s said it’s not complete and still needs to move through the legislative process. In the end, there is much that’s unknown about the California proposal, including whether it will ever pass the Legislature. What we do know is that Villaraigosa’s statement about taking away Medicare is partially accurate, but leaves out key context and tells only part of the story. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08116	In 2007, "the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income," which is "more than the entire bottom 50 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/10/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-viral-speech-says-top-1-percent-ear/	On Nov. 30, 2010, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, made a Senate floor speech about the gap between rich and poor in America. It soon went viral on the Internet. After receiving a number of requests from readers to fact-check it, we decided to do just that. We'll take a look at two of the claims Sanders made. In this item, we'll look at how Sanders characterizes the income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans. In a separate item, we'll look at whether Sanders is correct about the tax bill paid by oil giant ExxonMobil. Here's a portion of Sanders' speech, which came during Senate debate over extending tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Democrats and Republicans divided over whether the cuts should be extended for the wealthiest Americans. "Mr. President, in the year 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income," Sanders said. "The top 1 percent earned 23.5 percent of all income--more than the entire bottom 50 percent. That is apparently not enough. The percentage of income going to the top 1 percent has nearly tripled since the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, the top 1 percent earned about 8 percent of all income. In the 1980s, that figure jumped to 14 percent. In the late 1990s, that 1 percent earned about 19 percent." To keep matters simple, we'll stick to checking Sanders' claim that "the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income," which is "more than the entire bottom 50 percent." When we asked Sanders' office for a source, they pointed us to a study dated Aug. 5, 2009 by University of California (Berkeley) economist Emmanuel Saez, "Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (update with 2007 estimates)." We looked at the paper and found this line: The top 1 percent "has gone through enormous fluctuations along the course of the twentieth century, from about 18 percent (of income) before WWI, to a peak to almost 24 percent in the late 1920s, to only about 9 percent during the 1960s-1970s, and back to almost 23.5 percent by 2007." An accompanying chart confirmed the 23.5 percent figure for 2007. In a chart subsequently updated by Saez and forwarded to us by Sanders' office, the percentage of income earned by the top 1 percent actually fell modestly by 2008, to just under 21 percent. Still, Sanders was specific in his speech about referring to 2007, and the number he cited was calculated by a credentialed academic economist specializing in income and wealth statistics -- a pretty credible source, in our view. So the number looked pretty solid to us. Still, we've looked at a similar question before, so we were aware that various economists have attempted to grapple with this question. In the interest of making extra certain that Sanders was right, we decided to see whether the results in the Saez study mirrored those published elsewhere. One paper we found is by Arthur B. Kennickell, assistant director of the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Research and Statistics. This paper, published Jan. 7, 2009, found that the top 1 percent's share of income was 21.4 percent in 2007 -- slightly lower than the 23.5 percent that Sanders cited but certainly in the ballpark. That's also higher than the 14.6 percent taken by the bottom 50 percent, which is consistent with what Sanders had said. Another study, published in 2010 by Adrian Dungan and Kyle Mudry of the Internal Revenue Service's Individual Returns Analysis Section, found the top 1 percent taking 22.8 percent of income. Once again, this is slightly lower than what Sanders quoted, but in the same vicinity. That was also well over the 12.3 percent earned by the bottom 50 percent, which is once again consistent with what Sanders said. The differences from study to study likely stem from two factors -- the source of the data (using information from tax returns rather than surveys of American families, for instance) and the definition of "income" (such as whether capital gains are included in the calculations). When we asked Kennickell whether there was some reason to prefer one study over another, he responded that they all have their own merits. "There are many definitions of income that may be appropriate for various purposes," he said. So, we're left with three studies that vary slightly but which all point in the same general direction -- showing the top 1 percent earning between 21.4 and 23.5 percent of the national income in 2007. The studies also show that this share exceeds what the entire bottom 50 percent of the United States earns. So we rate Sanders' statement True.

pomt-01418	"According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/08/morgan-brittany/did-washington-tell-responders-prep-ebola-months-a/	As if Ebola were not frightening enough in its own right, it is a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. One of the latest comes from Morgan Brittany, a former actress from the original television soap opera Dallas who is now a commentator with the conspiracy-minded blog WND. Brittany suggests that Ebola is part of a larger White House plan to control the nation. Brittany’s column describes a Los Angeles dinner party where the conversation turned grim. "One of the men brought up the fact that Washington has known for months if not years that we were at risk for some sort of global pandemic," Brittany wrote. "According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola. Hmm, that’s just like the fact that they knew 60,000 illegal children were going to be coming across our southern border eight months before it happened." A few months ago, we debunked that last eyebrow-raising bit about the government being behind the surge of undocumented children at the border. Now, we examine whether something called "the Disaster Assistance Response Team" was told to get ready for an outbreak of Ebola. Brittany’s column provided a link to Global Research, another conspiracy website. Global Research had its own alarming article. "A large government supplier of emergency response products specializing in ‘high risk events’ says that Disaster Assistance Response Teams were told to prepare to be activated in the month of October. The shocking revelation, made on the Golden State FIRE EMS Twitter page, suggests that not only did someone know that the Ebola virus would be reaching America, but that they knew exactly when it would happen." Global Research even had a screenshot of the Twitter exchange from Sept. 30, and indeed, there we found, "DART teams were notified months ago they would be activated in October. Timing seems weird. Source: current DART member." The tweets are authentic. What’s lacking is anything of substance behind them. We spoke to Ed Castillo, president of Golden State FIRE EMS. Castillo was regretful. "A couple of EMS guys were talking about conspiracy theories," Castillo said. "There are no facts to support it. It can be written off as a couple of guys shooting the breeze." Golden State is based in Woodland Hills, Calif. Among other services, it contracts with Hollywood film companies to have a medical team on hand when they shoot stunt sequences. Castillo said the company’s only goal now is to "extinguish the flames" and stop hearing from conspiracy theorists. "These guys came out of the woodwork left and right," Castillo said. "We had to tear down our Twitter account. Now we’re just sticking to Facebook and our Web page. We just want to get back to work." The Golden State tweets might have been vacuous blather taken as reality, but the Global Research and Brittany posts went beyond even what the tweets said. Their reference to a "large government supplier of emergency response products" seems to have greatly reimagined Golden State’s line of work. To write about "the Disaster Assistance Response Team" as a singular entity also seems odd. Such a name applies generically to any group that jumps in to help in a disaster. Brittany doesn’t write definitively that these theories are accurate but closed her article on a note of fear. "Maybe the current administration needs this to happen so martial law can be declared, guns can be seized and the populace can be controlled. Once that happens … game over." Our ruling Brittany passed along as fact that a government supplier knew that emergency responders had been told well in advance to get ready for Ebola. The rumor was based on tweets from a private California medical and safety services company, which now says the tweets were based on nothing.

The state’s smoking ban, approved by the Legislature and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle in 2009, took effect in July 2010 and continues to stir debates. Some tavern and restaurant owners say it’s hurt their business and driven away long-time patrons -- or sent them outside to shiver. Others say state government shouldn’t be mandating what businesses can and can not do. Meanwhile, smoking ban supporters are pleased they can have a beer or a meal and not go home smelling like an ashtray. On June 30, 2011, as the ban’s first anniversary approached, Gov. Scott Walker issued a statement that said he would not support a repeal of the ban. That sounded like a new stance from the conservative Republican governor. So, we decided to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which measures how consistent politicians have been on key issues. Remember: It does not examine whether a change in position is a good one from a political or a policy perspective. Indeed, on contentious issues, some will view a switch as sensible flexibility in response to constituent demands. Others will see it as political appeasement or caving to pressure. As they say, where you stand depends on where you sit. In this case, perhaps, especially if you sit at the bar. Here is the sum total of Walker’s statement: "Although I did not support the original smoking ban, after listening to people across the state, it is clear to me that it works. Therefore I will not support a repeal." What did Walker say about the smoking ban in the past? While a candidate for governor, Walker was opposed to the ban, and then his position shifted -- to being even more strongly opposed to it. The shift came in response to positions staked out by Mark Neumann, his opponent in the Republican primary election. Here’s how that played out: Walker said on July 6, 2010, that he would didn’t believe that government should have been involved. "On principle I don’t think the government or anybody else should be telling these establishments or anybody else what they should or shouldn’t do," he said. A few days later, Neumann said he supported repealing the ban: "The smoking ban to me is a local issue and it’s about personal responsibility and personal freedoms and local control." The following day, on July 10, 2010, Walker matched Neumann’s call for a repeal of the ban: "I don't think the government should have been involved in a smoking ban in the first place, and as governor, I would sign a repeal of this law." The smoking ban did not become a key issue during the primary campaign or the general election. And Walker did not made any additional statements about the ban until the one where he said he would not back its repeal. Studies by groups such as the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center said that air quality in state bars and restaurants had improved 92 percent since the ban took effect. And SmokeFree Wisconsin, a group that supported the ban, said 75 percent of state residents support the ban. So, Walker started out opposed to the ban, even toughening his stance to promise a repeal. But now he’s opposed to a repeal, so the ban will remain. For those scoring at home, that comes in as a Full Flop.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-07-07T09:00:00	2011-06-30	['Wisconsin']
pomt-03726	The Internal Revenue Service spent $60,000 on a "Star Trek" training video.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/15/tom-graves/congressman-finds-no-humor-irs-star-trek-parody/	Video. The final frontier for some federal workers. A group of Internal Revenue Service employees went where few had gone before by creating a video in which they dressed as "Star Trek" characters. The video was intended for training purposes. When word got out about the video, particularly that tens of thousands of dollars were spent on it, many said the IRS workers should not have gone there. The critics included a Georgia congressman. "Next time anyone (@barackobama) says they need to raise your taxes, send them this IRS star trek video -- cost you $60k," U.S. Rep. Tom Graves posted on his Twitter page. PolitiFact Georgia went on a mission to see whether the North Georgia Republican was correct. Thankfully, our search for the facts didn’t take as much time as Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and their crew spent on the Starship Enterprise. CBS News filed a federal Freedom of Information Act to get a copy of a 6-minute video of IRS employees in "Star Trek" gear decrying various tax evasion schemes. Here’s how the video began: "Space: the final frontier These are the voyagers of the Starship Enterprise Y Its never-ending mission is to seek out new tax forms To explore strange new regulations To boldly go where no government employee has gone before." The video ends with the crew heading from space back to Earth to pick up a "tax gap vaccine." Many news organizations quickly picked up on the story. The video was made in 2010. William Shatner, who starred as Capt. James T. Kirk in the television series, was not pleased about it. "So I watched that IRS video. I am appalled at the utter waste of US tax dollars," Shatner posted on Twitter. This was not the only video. In 2011, some IRS workers dressed as characters from the campy 1960s television series "Gilligan’s Island" for another training video. Combined, the IRS said two videos cost $60,000. Couldn’t Thurston Howell III at least put up the money for the "Gilligan’s Island" video? Some news organizations, however, reported just the "Star Trek" video cost $60,000. Graves’ tweet did not mention the "Gilligan’s Island" video. PolitiFact Georgia contacted the congressman’s office to see whether it was aware of the other video. We were told the best person to talk to about it was Graves’ spokesman, John Donnelly, who was out of the country for a week and temporarily unavailable for comment. We caught up with Donnelly when he returned. He explained that the office saw some of the errant media reports and headlines and based its tweet on them. "IRS admits $60,000 'Star Trek' parody video a mistake," was the headline of an NBCNews.com story. The article reported the existence of both videos and noted they cost a combined $60,000. The vast majority of news outlets reported $60,000 was spent on both videos. In a statement, Donnelly reiterated the congressman’s concerns about how taxpayer dollars were spent. "The fact that the IRS used even 1 cent of someone’s hard-earned paycheck to make these bizarre videos is a horrific abuse of public funds and an embarrassing illustration of what happens when bureaucracies are bloated by billions of dollars in deficit spending," Donnelly said. "Pause for a moment and consider that your tax dollars were used to pay for props like replica Spock ears, and think about how the IRS spent well over Georgia’s median household income to create these exorbitant spoofs -- it is absolutely shameful." The IRS contends there was a cost benefit to the "Gilligan’s Island" video. The video "was used to train taxpayer assistance employees in approximately 400 locations across the United States, saving an estimated $1.5 million as compared to the potential costs to train these employees in person," acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller wrote in a letter to U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., chairman of a House oversight subcommittee. Some news outlets reported that the "Star Trek" video cost more than the "Gilligan’s Island" video. The IRS did not respond to our follow-up question concerning the cost of each video. To sum up, Graves posted on Twitter that the IRS spent $60,000 on a training video in which some of its employees were dressed as "Star Trek" characters. The IRS says that video and another cost a combined $60,000. Graves’ statement was based on inaccurate news coverage. Most news organizations, though, got it right. The congressman’s claim is partially accurate. The IRS did spend a lot of taxpayer money on a "Star Trek" video. But Graves’ claim omits some important context, primarily that the $60,000 is inflated since that price tag covered two questionable videos. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-01360	"I was speaking out on pension reform almost 17 years ago."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/20/ernest-almonte/treasurer-candidate-ernest-almonte-says-he-was-spe/	Next to jobs and the economy, public employee pensions have been among the biggest issues in many 2014 political campaigns. Ernest Almonte, an independent running for general treasurer, was asked during an interview that aired Oct. 5, 2014 on the second half of WLNE's "On the Record" whether the 2011 overhaul of Rhode Island’s state pension system went far enough. "First of all," Almonte said, "I was speaking out on pension reform almost 17 years ago, warning elected officials that if you didn't take care of this problem, it would take draconian measures" to fix it. As a "matter of fact," he said, "it got to the point of saying that, 'If you're not going to fix this, you should start, (instead of) sending your children and grandchildren birthday cards and Christmas cards, you should just send them invoices and just tell them the truth: You're passing on your debt to them,' So something had to be done." We wondered whether Almonte, who served as Rhode Island's Auditor General from 1994 to 2010, was prescient enough to be warning about problems with Rhode Island’s public pension systems 17 years ago, and what kinds of reforms he was saying were needed. Almonte’s campaign sent us several documents from the auditor general's office. Only a few go back to late 1990s and the relevant ones dealt with pension payment problems in individual communities, not state employees. One was a 1998 letter to Coventry's treasurer saying that some of the town's pension plans "have insufficient assets to meet projected benefits." That was 16 years ago. Another was a 1998 copy of a report by the Johnston Financial Review Commission, which Almonte chaired, warning that the town owed $3.2 million in required pension contributions for its employees. For example, Johnston hadn't paid into the firemen's pension fund for more than three years, putting it more than $1.3 million behind in its payments. We note that Almonte's comments in both of these reports are in dry auditor language. Some readers might not take that as the type of scary warning that Almonte says he made. But we also found a May 8, 1988 front-page Providence Journal story reporting how Almonte explained to more than 200 Johnston residents that their town was in deep financial trouble. "To drive home the severity of the situation," the story said, "Almonte gave examples that sometimes made the audience wince: A bottom-of-the-barrel credit rating. A time between April 1996 and March 1997 when the town's bank account was overdrawn for 146 days. Falling behind $3.19 million in required pension contributions for workers. "And that's not all, Almonte said. Still to be reckoned with is an unfunded pension liability that hasn't been quantified, and could add up to untold millions," the story reported. Almonte's campaign also referred us to a March 1999 report, available on the Auditor General's website, for the 1997 fiscal year. It notes that "five school districts, five municipalities and three police and fire units were delinquent" to the tune of about $1.7 million in their pension payments. The state withheld school aid and traffic fine payments to six municipalities until they paid up. That was 15 years ago. If Almonte wasn't warning about a looming crisis in the state pension system in those days, that's because there wasn't one. His 2000 audit of the state Employees' Retirement System, covering the fiscal year that ended in 1999, reported that the funded ratios -- the amount of money each plan had compared to the amount of money it was expected to need to cover its pension costs -- had been growing steadily for years. The ratio for state employees, for example, went from 73 percent in 1993 to 81 percent in 1998. In addition, all the plans had been getting the recommended amount of funding since at least 1996 and, in many cases, even longer. That would change. By 2006, the funded ratio for that plan had dropped to 55 percent. By 2009, it had only gone up to 59 percent and the debate about pension costs was poised to explode. We found no documentation from that era suggesting Almonte was advocating the type of sweeping changes to the separate pension plans for state employees and teachers that were pushed by General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and approved by the General Assembly and Governor Lincoln Chafee. In an interview, Almonte argued that he was talking about the state's pension problem at the time because late payments he was referring to were payments by cities and towns to the state-run Municipal Employees' Retirement System, also known as MERS, which is under the jurisdiction of the state treasurer. "Reform is not just what you to do an employee or an employee's benefits," he said. "I was advocating a reform of management" to get the communities to make their payments on time, especially when the money being withheld by workers to help pay for pension benefits is being retained by the city or town. "When payments are made late, you miss out on earnings, and that's the start of the problem because the problem compounds itself." Our ruling Ernest Almonte said, "I was speaking out on pension reform almost 17 years ago." The comment was in the context of a question on the state's pension system. It’s clear from documentation Almonte provided and information we found that Almonte was warning about problems years ago. But the documentation he could provide only dealt with problems in municipal plans, although some of those were in the MERS system run by the state. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rule it Mostly True.

pomt-02924	"Rand Paul’s speech ... on 'Gattaca' was totally ripped off of Wikipedia."	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/01/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-rand-pauls-gattaca-speech-was-t/	There’s no love lost between Rachel Maddow and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. The MSNBC host for years has criticized the rising Republican star and libertarian during her evening talk show. So when Maddow went on a rant about a recent stump speech Paul gave on behalf of Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, at first it seemed like business as usual. During remarks Oct. 28 at Liberty University, Paul ventured into a diatribe against eugenics -- a sensitive topic in Virginia, where until 1979 it was legal to sterilize the mentally disabled -- when he brought up the 1997 sci-fi thriller Gattaca, starring Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law. It’s at that point Maddow said he got into trouble, claiming Paul’s comments about the movie were "totally ripped off of Wikipedia." "Rand Paul wants to be president," she added. "But right now he’s just lifting whole sections of this Wikipedia entry hoping that nobody’s going to notice and he can call it his speech." It’s not the first time a politician has been accused of (ahem) borrowing his words from someone else. But from Wikipedia? It seemed too sophomoric a slipup for someone like Paul, who filibustered for 13 hours straight on the Senate floor earlier this year without any accusations of lifting his remarks. It’s true the campaign trail isn’t the classroom, where copying and pasting from secondary sources is a fatal sin. But Paul is a major political player in Washington, and is considering a run for president in 2016. So a bold accusation like Maddow’s raised our eyebrow. Paul shrugged it off as a phony controversy ignited by Maddow, who he said has been "spreading hate on me for about three years now." "This is really about information and attacks coming from haters," Paul said. We’re more than familiar with the "haters gonna hate" defense, just as we fact-checkers know what it’s like to be on the receiving end of Maddow’s scorn. But it was a serious enough claim that we decided to check it out anyway. What Wikipedia says We wanted to review the Gattaca Wikipedia page for ourselves. Any of the site’s users can edit entries as they see fit, meaning pages’ content changes frequently. But the pages’ edit histories are public, too, making it clear who added or changed which information and when. At first, we thought it might be possible that a reader edited the movie’s Wikipedia entry to match Paul’s speech after-the-fact. However, the history shows no change to the page between Sept. 25 and Oct. 29, the day after he stumped for Cuccinelli. Let’s check several examples of Paul’s words against the Sept. 25 version of the page: "In the not-too-distant future, eugenics is common and DNA plays a primary role in determining your social class." The Wikipedia entry reads, "In ‘the not-too-distant future’, liberal eugenics is common and DNA plays the primary role in determining social class." That looks nearly identical. "Due to frequent screenings, Vincent faces genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way to achieve his dream of becoming an astronaut, is he has to become what’s called a ‘borrowed ladder.’ " Wikipedia: "Due to frequent screening, Vincent faces genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way he can achieve his dream of becoming an astronaut is to become a ‘borrowed ladder’, a person who impersonates a ‘valid’ with a superior genetic profile." That too is mostly identical, with a brief addition at the end. "He assumes the identity of Jerome Morrow, a world-class swimming star with a genetic profile said to be ‘secondary to none’ but he’s been paralyzed in a car accident." Wikipedia: "He assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow, a former swimming star with a genetic profile ‘second to none’, who had been injured in a car accident, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down." Some of the wording here is different, but the sentence structure is strikingly identical. "Jerome buys his identity -- uses his DNA, his blood, his hair, his tissue, his urine -- to pass the screenings." Wikipedia: "Vincent ‘buys’ Jerome's identity and uses his 'valid' DNA in blood, hair, tissue, and urine samples to pass screening." Almost identical, but Paul mixed up the character names. Sensing a pattern? So are we. Paul was adamant there was no wrongdoing. Speaking on Oct. 30 to Fusion, a news and pop culture network aimed at young Hispanics, Paul insisted "nothing we said was not given attribution to where it came from" and the matter was a "disagreement on how you footnote things." "We borrowed the plot lines from Gattaca. It’s a movie," Paul told Fusion. "I gave credit to the people who wrote the movie." In a statement to PolitiFact on Nov. 1, his office added: "While Sen. Paul doesn’t believe that this is the normal standard for speeches, going forward he will be more cautious in presenting and attributing sources." Experts weigh in Paul’s excuse doesn’t hold water, said Bob Lehrman, author of The Political Speechwriter’s Companion and a former speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore. "When I looked at the size of language and how closely he took it, I thought that was really inappropriate, and his defense of it shows he’s either desperate to shield something or he doesn’t understand plagiarism," he said. Lehrman, who also teaches a speech writing class at American University, says he tells his students lifting "even one distinctive phrase or sentence is plagiarism and is grounds for turning you in. It is absolutely inappropropriate." It’s happened before. Then-Sen. Barack Obama was campaigning for president in 2008 when he was caught using a line uttered previously by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. It turned out to be a blip in the race. "People do it," Lehrman said. "That doesn’t mean it’s the right thing, and it’s not the right thing to take language and just use it in a speech without attributing it." Paul’s speech is a more serious offense than that of Obama’s 2008 gaffe, said Jonathan Bailey, the creator of Plagiarism Today, an online resource for writers to combat plagiarism. Obama forgot an attribution, one he remembered several other times, and acknowledged the error. "What gets me is not so much what happened," Bailey said. "What happened by itself is fairly mundane. All Paul had to do was apologize." But Paul claiming he credited the movie exacerbated his problem, since the movie itself wasn’t what he lifted from. "A little transparency, a little openness about what happened and why it’s not going to happen again would also go a long way," he said. Our ruling We’ll leave it to the prognosticators to determine how much impact Paul’s blunder will have on his political prospects, but the facts are pretty clear on this one. Maddow was dead on; Paul recited Gattaca’s Wikipedia page nearly word-for-word. We rate her statement True.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2013-11-01T18:03:45	2013-10-28	['None']
pomt-05526	Says she balanced a $10 billion budget shortfall without raising taxes.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/11/elizabeth-ames-jones/elizabeth-ames-jones-says-she-balanced-10-billion-/	In an online video, Texas Senate hopeful Elizabeth Ames Jones says voters can count on her to oppose higher taxes. Jones, a former Texas railroad commissioner and legislator who’s among challengers to Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in the May 2012 Republican primary, opens her video: "Texans need a new state senator -- one who’s 100 percent committed to tackling our budget problems without raising your taxes -- and that’s what I’ve done." The ad’s narrator later says: "She was a leader, balancing a $10 billion budget shortfall in the Texas House -- $10 billion -- and she did it without raising your taxes." Wait: The House has 150 members -- and can’t pass a budget into law without the Senate and governor also signing off. That in mind, we inquired into how Jones balanced the budget referenced in her ad. Jones campaign spokesman Patrick Isenberg told us in a telephone interview that the claim ties to Jones voting in 2003 to balance the 2004-05 state budget in the face of a $10 billion revenue shortfall -- without raising taxes. At the time, too, Jones was a member of the budget-drafting House Appropriations Committee. Isenberg also passed along newspaper stories including an excerpt of a Jan. 12, 2003, San Antonio Express-News news article quoting Jones saying that legislators should balance the budget without new taxes. "When an economy is slow, it's not really the time to initiate new taxes," the story quotes her as saying. As we noted in a May 2010 check of a shortfall-related claim by Gov. Rick Perry, the $10 billion figure reflects then-State Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn’s grim forecast as the 2003 Legislature convened that state revenues for the 2004-2005 budget period would fall short of estimated expenditures by $7.4 billion. Add looming expenses — a health plan for local school district employees plus projected health and human services needs — and the state was facing a $9.9 billion state revenue shortfall, Strayhorn said. To cover the projected shortfall in the months remaining in the 2003 fiscal year, the Legislature trimmed $1.4 billion in budgeted state spending, while spending $450 million from the rainy day fund. But lawmakers also passed a 2004-2005 budget that appropriated $1.8 billion less in state funds than had been spent during 2002-03, according to the Fiscal Size-up published by the advisory Legislative Budget Board. They added $811 million from the rainy day fund. And they used $1.3 billion in federal aid, part of fiscal relief made available to states in response to economic difficulties in the wake of Sept. 11, 2001. Other steps: Members voted to extend a tax on telephone customers originally levied to pay for technology in schools and hospitals, raise fees for certain state services and use creative accounting to defer state payments to the next budget period.. So, the Legislature closed the $10 billion shortfall in 2003 via various mechanisms, none of them a tax increase. And Jones voted for the version of the budget advanced by the appropriations committee on April 7, 2003, according to an April 8, 2003 Express-News article poined out by Isenberg. That story quoted her as noting that the committee salvaged a slimmed-down Children's Health Insurance Program after a subcommittee recommended its abolition. Jones, describing the budget as frugal "belt tightening," was also quoted saying: "This is not a tea party." On April 17, 2003, Jones was among House members to vote for its version of the budget, House Bill 1, which went to the Senate by a 100-45 margin, the House Journal says. On June 1, 2003, she voted for the ultimate House-Senate compromise version, which went to Gov. Rick Perry by 105-41, according to the journal entry for that day, We asked an Austin consultant to Jones, Todd Olsen, to elaborate on how Jones led the state to the balanced budget without a tax increase. Olsen underscored her membership on the appropriations committee, where he said she heard hours of testimony. As to budget-related roles played by other lawmakers, the Senate and governor, Olsen said: "I think voters know there are 150 members in the House, and that there’s a governor and that there are three branches of government." He said too that Jones was the first woman elected to a leadership post in the House Republican Caucus. According to a Feb. 6, 2003, Austin American-Statesman news article, Jones was elected vice chair of the House Republican Caucus in the 2003 session. Finally, Isenberg forwarded the script of what he described as a radio ad on the theme of the web video, which he said was also airing as a TV ad. In the radio ad, according to the script, Jones says she was a House member when she was a leader in balancing the budget without a tax increase. Our ruling Jones was among a select group of House members to draft the first version of the budget that she touts and ultimately voted, like most House colleagues, to send to the governor. Her video could easily have specified that Jones fought in the House for no new taxes and worked to make up a $10 billion shortfall. In contrast, it leaves the misimpression that "she did it," all of it, as if by herself. All told, her claim has a clear-cut element of truth, but ignores critical facts putting her role in perspective. We rate her statement Mostly False.

pomt-03556	"We have a tax code that allows groups to use their political operations within the tax code, under the guise of a charity, to use undisclosed millions of dollars to do political campaigns."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/22/xavier-becerra/tax-code-allows-groups-spend-undisclosed-donations/	The fallout from the Internal Revenue Service’s tougher scrutiny of tea party groups continues with former IRS officials testifying that they never tried to mislead Congress about IRS practices. Republican senators like Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, were openly skeptical. "You lied by omission," Hatch said. President Barack Obama and Democrats have criticized the excesses of the IRS. But some would like to shift the focus to the legal ambiguity that allows some tax-exempt groups to engage in politics without revealing their donors, as formal campaign organizations must do. The chair of the House Democratic Caucus, Xavier Becerra of California, promoted that line during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press. "We have a tax code that allows groups to use their political operations within the tax code, under the guise of a charity, to use undisclosed millions of dollars to do political campaigns," Becerra said. We checked whether charities actually can engage in politics and the experts we reached were quite clear. If by charities, you mean groups with 501(c)(3) status, the law says they can’t. "If Rep. Becerra had used the term ‘tax-exempt organizations’ rather than the word ‘charities,’ his statement would be correct," said Brett Kappel, counsel at the Washington law firm Arent Fox. Kappel represented the Ron Paul 2012 campaign. "Charities are 501(c)(3) organizations and cannot engage in any partisan political activities," Kappel continued. "501(c)(4) social welfare organizations are tax exempt, but they are not charities. They can engage in partisan political activities as long as they are not the organization's primary activity." Becerra said his target was 501(c)(4) groups and notes that the tax code spells out that for such groups, their net income should be "devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes." "Charitable is another form of the word charity," Becerra told PolitiFact. "I used that word because Americans understand it and they associate it with something good, not groups that are in the business to do politics. If I had said 501(c)(4), they would have understood everything except that term." There are thousands of tax-exempt organizations that have the legal right to try to shape the course of legislative votes and elections. They could be a chamber of commerce, a child welfare organization that presses for certain legislation, or powerful political players like Crossroads GPS, founded by Republican strategist Karl Rove. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Crossroads GPS spent $70 million on television ads and other media in the last election. For the curious, here’s how the rules breakdown for the different groups: • Charities - 501(c)(3): Donations are tax deductible; donors go unreported; no political activity allowed • Social Welfare - 501(c)(4): Donations are not tax deductible; donors go unreported; some political activity allowed. • Super PAC - 527 groups: Donations are not tax deductible; donors are reported; political activity allowed. Social Welfare Organizations IRS regulations define a social welfare organization as one that is "primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good and general welfare of the people of the community, i.e., primarily for the purpose of bringing about civic betterment and social improvements." Since civic betterment is in the eye of the beholder, a group can form around virtually any cause. It can raise money to support its activities, and ever since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case, it has a relatively free hand to try to shape the outcomes of elections. Kenneth Gross is a former lawyer for the Federal Elections Commission and now heads the political law practice at the Washington firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. Gross says the Citizens United decision gave 501(c)(4) groups considerable leeway. "They can run ads that say don't vote for some candidate," Gross said. "They can go very strong, so long as they can say they are predominantly a social welfare organization." Gross noted that spending on campaign ads triggers the need to report the expenditures to the FEC, and to that extent, disclosure is part of the picture. Brad Smith, law professor at Capital University School of Law in Columbus, Ohio, says Becerra is wrong to ignore the FEC reporting. "We know how much (c)(4)’s spent, we know what they spent it on and what candidates they supported or opposed," Smith said. "All we don't know are the names of individual donors." But that Bercerra told us, was his point. Disclosure of donors, their names and the amounts they gave, is never required. This goes back to a 1958 Supreme Court ruling involving the NAACP. In that decision, the court said keeping membership lists private is essential to protecting the constitutional right to assemble. Becerra made his comments in the middle of a discussion about whether the public should know the backers of groups that intervene in politics. If a candidate, political party, an ordinary political action committee or a Super PAC raises money, it must report its donors. But not a 501(c)(4). So long as the group can argue that most of their other activities are aimed at nonpolitical social welfare goals, it can engage in hardcore political work. "This controversy is 100 percent about disclosure," Gross said. How much is too much The crunch point in the debate over 501(c)(4) organizations is the fuzziness over what percentage of their effort goes toward engaging in bare knuckles politics. IRS rules say such groups must be organized exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, but in terms of how much political work they do, the rules limit that only in a relative sense. The political effort can not be their "primary activity." The IRS does not define its terms. "Some lawyers say, so long as it’s 49.99 percent, it’s okay," said Gross. "But there is no percentage in the regulations." Allison Hayward, an attorney and a board member of the House Office of Congressional Ethics, says the IRS decides whether a group is following the rules based on a test that evaluates "facts and circumstances." "It is a test that doesn’t offer a lot of clarity," Hayward said. Our ruling Becerra said the tax code allows charities to spend undisclosed millions to do political campaigns. Becerra might have used the word "charities" too broadly to describe the tax-exempt organizations that rely on this wrinkle of the tax code. Becerra said he was trying to use language that most people would understand instead of the tax code’s technical term of a 501(c)(4) group. He’s right that these organizations can raise millions to engage in politics, and they need not reveal their donors. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-12820	Says former President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominations "required 60 votes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/09/bernie-sanders/sanders-said-obamas-scotus-nominees-required-60-vo/	Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said President Donald Trump’s nominees to the Supreme Court should follow the same confirmation process as the nominees of former President Barack Obama. In a Feb. 5 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, CNN host Jake Tapper asked if he would join an effort to filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination. "Look, Obama’s nominations required 60 votes," Sanders said. He continued, "Obama had to get 60 votes, that’s the rules of the United States. And if 60 people vote to confirm Judge Gorsuch, he will become the next nominee. That is the process, those are the rules that we operate under." We decided to fact-check Sanders’ claim that Obama’s Supreme Court nominees "had to get 60 votes." Sanders has a point, but he is somewhat overplaying what happened. Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor received more than 60 Senate votes, but Senate rules only require a simple majority to confirm a Supreme Court nominee. Sanders’ comment echoes similar claims from other high-ranking Democrats after Senate Republicans blocked Obama’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to fill the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. Here’s how the confirmation process will work for Gorsuch: He will testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If the committee refers his nomination to the full Senate (a likely outcome due to the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee), a vote by the full Senate needs to be taken. The Senate majority leader moves to take the Senate into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. Then, the Senate majority leader needs to bring a nominee to a vote by the full Senate. In Gorsuch’s case, barring any outstanding circumstances, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee. However, if unanimous consent cannot be reached, Sen. McConnell would need to invoke cloture. A "cloture vote," agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes, the threshold Sanders has referenced. (His office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Obama’s nominees cleared the procedural hurdles and won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010, and Sotomayor was confirmed in 2009 by a vote of 68-31. The last Supreme Court nominee to face a cloture vote to ensure confirmation was President George W. Bush’s nominee Samuel A. Alito Jr. in 2006. After the cloture vote, Alito was confirmed 58-42. That means at least two senators decided to allow the vote to go forward without actually voting for Alito themselves. (In Alito’s case, it was more than two, as 72 senators voted for cloture.) The accuracy of Sanders’ statement hinges on which vote we are talking about. If the Senate doesn’t unanimously consent to voting on the nominee, then 60 votes are required to end debate and hold a confirmation vote. But the confirmation itself, strictly speaking, requires only a simple majority. Our ruling Sanders said Obama’s Supreme Court nominations "required 60 votes." Going into the nomination fight, Obama had to prepare for the possibility that his nominees would need 60 votes to support cloture, as Alito required during the Bush administration. But once the unanimous consent agreement or cloture was reached, all the nominees needed was a simple majority. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-07676	"Since 1999, all Virginia Lottery profits have been used for public education in the Commonwealth for kindergarten through 12th grade."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/09/virginia-lottery/virginia-lottery-claims-all-profits-1999-have-gone/	With the Mega Millions jackpot up to $151 million, Virginians will be flocking to stores this week to buy lottery tickets. Of course, there’s no guarantee a Virginian will win. Forty-one states plus Washington, D.C. play the game and the chance of winning is almost 1 in 176 million for each dollar laid down. The Virginia Lottery encourages play by saying all of the profits it generates go to a good cause. "Since 1999, all Virginia lottery profits have been used for public education in the Commonwealth, for kindergarten through 12th grade," its website boasts. State politicians and officials have long debated whether all lottery profits really go to public schools. So we decided to take a look. But before we get to the numbers, it’s helpful to consider a thumbnail history of the Virginia Lottery. Voters approved it in 1987 and the first tickets were sold in 1988. During the first two years, lottery profits were set aside tor construction projects. During the 1991 recession, the proceeds were moved to the state’s general fund which supports K-12 schools, health and public safety. In 1995, the General Assembly was controlled by Democrats. Then-Gov. George Allen, a Republican, accused the Democrats of breaking long-standing promises to earmark every dollar of profits for education. Although news stories from the time say Allen did not provide proof of his claim, defensive lawmakers approved the Omnibus Education Act which required all lottery revenues sent to the general fund to be used only for public education. Many Republicans and educators denounced the bill as an election-year sham. That was because the $312 million in annual lottery profits at the time was one of many revenue sources flowing into the multi-billion dollar general fund. No one could say with certainty whether proceeds would up in education or another service. Think of it this way: when raindrops fall into a reservoir, can anyone pinpoint whose bathtub they fill? In 2000, the General Assembly asked voters to approve a state constitutional amendment that required lottery profits only be used for public education. The amendment was overwhelmingly approved. It established a Lottery Proceeds Fund to funnel lottery profits to education. The controversy was hardly settled, however. The new coffer was made part of the general fund. Again, it was impossible to trace a direct flow of lottery profits into public schools. Although state support for education increased over ensuing years, it’s impossible specify how much of the rise was caused by lottery profits and how much was caused by revenue surges from a variety of taxes that pour into the general fund. Walt Kucharski, Virginia’s long-time Auditor of Public Accounts, says he has always been able to confirm that state lottery officials have transmitted their profits to the general fund. But until three years ago, he could not verify that 100 percent of the lottery proceeds ended up in the K-12 budget. "Can I match it up dollar for dollar, serial number to serial number, the answer is no," Kucharski said. That changed in 2008 when the General Assembly, heeding advice from then-Attorney General Bob McDonnell, separated the Lottery Proceeds Fund from the general fund. The action provided the direct pipeline that allowed Kucharski and others to trace the flow of lottery money into schools. Kucharski has no hesitation saying that since 2008, every penny of lottery profits has gone to public education. The state budget now lists line items that detail the allocations of the proceeds to specific education programs. This fiscal year, the Lottery is expected to contribute $436 million to the state’s $5.5 billion education budget. About two-thirds of the lottery money is earmarked for programs that help prepare four-year-olds from low income families to enter school, provide early reading intervention, provide breakfast for low-income students, and provide special education. John Hagerty, a lottery spokesman, noted that its always been up to the General Assembly to decide how to spend lottery profits. "The lottery makes the money and then hands it over to the state," Hagerty said. Let’s Review: The lottery says that since 1999, all of its profits have gone to support K-12 education. The claim has problems. Prior to 2008, the money went into the state’s general fund -- now totaling about $16 billion a year -- which supports major services such as health and public safety in addition to public schools. It was impossible to trace individual lottery profits into any specific program. Audits show lottery officials correctly transmitted all their proceeds to the state, but make no representations about how the money was specifically allocated. Since 2008, the state’s auditor of public accounts said that the profits go into their own separate fund and are distributed directly to localities for public education. The money is detailed in the state budget line items. Just as lottery officials can’t prove their claim that all lottery profits since 1999 have gone to education, nor we can we disprove it. The Lottery would lay aside doubts if it simply said all of its profits go to schools and didn’t mention a start date. We rate their claim Mostly True.

pomt-01863	The 2011 Rebuild America Jobs Act "would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year while making no significant impact to fix our infrastructure and roads."	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/11/monica-wehby/would-rebuild-america-jobs-act-have-cost-average-a/	Monica Wehby, a Portland pediatric neurosurgeon, is seeking to unseat incumbent U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat. The jabs they’ve traded so far include who would do a better job managing the economy. Wehby, a Republican, took Merkley to task for recently reiterating his support for the Rebuild America Jobs Act. The bill, proposed in late 2011 by President Barack Obama, called for an immediate $50 billion investment in roads, bridges, airports and transit systems. The act died when Democrats failed to rally enough votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. The claim: Wehby described Merkley’s vote for the act as "typical of a Washington insider like Senator Merkley." Then she added this: "I would have voted no because this legislation would have cost the average American family $1,000 a year while making no significant impact to fix our infrastructure and roads." PolitiFact Oregon wondered about the cost figure and checked. The analysis: Wehby’s criticism of Merkley’s vote included the assertion that the "nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s own analysis of the bill identified the cost of this legislation for every Oregon family to be $958.40 per year…" We checked the CBO’s website to see if that’s what it found. No such figure appears in the CBO’s analysis of the Rebuild America Jobs Act. Instead, the one-page analysis estimated only that the act, if implemented, would have brought in $56.7 billion in revenues through taxes, while spending $56.5 billion for infrastructure projects. In other words, it would have been nearly revenue-neutral, according to the CBO. We emailed Wehby’s campaign. Her communications manager, Dean Petrone, wrote back saying that the $958.40-per-year figure "is backed up by Jim Harper, director of Information Policy Studies at the Cato Institute." We emailed Harper, who wrote that "it appears very likely" that Wehby got her number from WashingtonWatch, a policy analysis site he maintains in his spare time. (Harper, incidentally, said he considers WashingtonWatch to be a libertarian-leaning site.) Harper faulted Wehby’s claim on two counts. The first involved the $958.40 figure itself. In reality, he said, only half of that would come in the form of new taxes. The remainder really doesn’t count since it’s in the form of new spending. And while it could be argued that new spending amounts to a long-term debit, the CBO’s own finding that the bill was budget-neutral negates that point. His second point was that "average families" would not have borne the burden of any new costs because language in the bill made clear that it would be financed by a 0.7 percent surtax on millionaires. "It’s important and relevant to many … that the incidence of the taxes would have been on relatively rich people," Harper wrote. "The $500 in taxes would not have hit the "typical" American or Oregonian family." The median household income in Oregon from 2008 through 2012 was $50,036, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In fact, only about seven percent of all Oregon households made more than $150,000 in 2012, according to the Oregon Employment Department. The ruling: Monica Wehby, in criticizing U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley’s support of a major transportation spending bill, said the legislation would have "cost the average American family $1,000 a year…" The source the campaigned relied on, Jim Harper of the Cato Institute, for the figure said only half that amount could be attributed to new taxes imposed on any household. The rest would come in the form of new spending for infrastructure projects. Harper acknowledged that the bill in question -- the Rebuild America Jobs Act -- contained language specifying that all costs would be financed by a 0.7 percent surtax on millionaires. Harper noted that any new taxes from the bill would not have affected the "typical American or Oregonian family." Wehby’s campaign attributed the original $958.40-per-year figure to the CBO’s "own analysis." When asked, the campaign said the figure actually came from a partisan political organization. The bill ultimately failed, but had it passed, it would not have cost the "average American family" a dime. We rate the claim False. Comments? Questions?

pomt-06806	"The country's bankrupt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/ron-paul/us-rep-ron-paul-says-countrys-bankrupt/	Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who has raised warning flags about U.S. debt for decades, declared in an Iowa debate Aug. 11, 2011, that "the country's bankrupt." Okay, we'll bite: Is it? PolitiFact Wisconsin tested a similar claim in February from Gov. Scott Walker ("We’re broke. We don't have any more money.") and found it False. But Paul's talking about the whole country. Paul's comment came as part of his response to the first question posed to him, by Fox News anchor Bret Baier. Here's the transcript: BAIER: Congressman Paul, as you know, when Standard & Poor's downgraded the country's credit rating last week, one of the reasons S&P listed was because of partisan gridlock in Washington. Congressman, what specific things would you do as president to increase growth, calm the markets, create jobs that could pass through a divided Congress? PAUL: Well, they didn't downgrade it mainly because they couldn't come to a conclusion. They couldn't come to a conclusion because they didn't know what was going on. The country's bankrupt, and nobody wanted to admit it. And when you're bankrupt, you can't keep spending. And all these proposed cuts weren't cuts at all. What you have to do is restore sound money. You have to understand why you have a business cycle, why you have booms and busts. If you don't do that, there's no way you can solve these problems. And the booms and busts comes from a failed monetary system that -- the interest rates that are way lower than -- than they should be encourages malinvestment and debt. And to get out of that, all this other tinkering, you cannot do that unless you liquidate debt. You don't bail out the people that are bankrupt and dump the debt on the people. That is what's happened. So you have to allow liquidation of debt, eliminate the malinvestment. Then you go back and you can get growth again by having a better tax structure, lower taxes, invite capital back into this country, get a lot less regulations. And under those conditions, you can have growth again. For this fact-check, we're not going to explore whether there's a grand conspiracy to hide the condition of U.S. finances. Rather, we'll focus on the simple question of whether the country is bankrupt. We e-mailed Paul's campaign asking for support for his statement, but didn't hear back by our deadline. Instead, we'll rely on common definitions of "bankrupt" that seem to best fit the context of Paul's statement. One is "declared in law unable to pay outstanding debts." Another is "reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished." We'll tackle the more specific definition first. Since the U.S. government hasn't landed in bankruptcy court and been declared unable to pay its bills, we'll simplify it to whether the United States can pay its debts. Ratings agencies such as Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch pay attention to this very question. They offer sovereign credit ratings based on the same idea as your credit score: What's the risk a nation might default on its debt by failing to pay its bills? And S&P did downgrade the country's credit rating on Aug. 5, 2011. But what does that mean, exactly? The United States had a AAA credit rating, which S&P defines as having "extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments." It's the highest rating you can get. After the downgrade, the United States has a AA+ credit rating. It's just one notch down from AAA on a scale that has more than 20 notches. S&P now says the United States "has very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments." The "+" shows that the U.S. rating is on the high side of AA. Meanwhile, two other ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, didn't change their U.S. ratings — America still has the highest rating they offer. Fitch Ratings said on Aug. 2, 2011, that "despite the heated political debate ... corporate sector balance sheets and profitability are healthy, underlying productivity growth is still relatively strong, and the U.S. dollar remains unchallenged as the global reserve currency." We'll note that the ratings are forward-looking -- they evaluate whether the United States is likely to default in the future. But Paul went further than that. He said "the country's bankrupt," in the present tense. So we asked the U.S. Treasury: Can the country pay its bills right now? Yes, said spokesman Matt Anderson. "Because Congress acted to prevent a default crisis, the government has been able to meet its financial obligations," he said. Meanwhile, he pointed out that the Bureau of Public Debt has had no trouble selling bills, notes and bonds to finance the public debt. Indeed, after S&P lowered America's credit rating, the amount of interest the United States has to pay on its new debt actually went down — our credit got cheaper! Why? As financial markets swing, investors still consider U.S. government securities a safer place than alternatives to park their money. (We should also note that unlike Wisconsin, which has many of the same tools to make ends meet -- taxes, layoffs, spending cuts, debt shifting -- the federal government as sovereign nation could just print more money.) Now, about that second definition, "reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished." Allow us an analogy: Your paycheck doesn't cover your bills every month. But you have a great credit score, use your credit card to cover the difference, and have no trouble paying your credit card bill. Would you describe yourself as "bankrupt" or "impoverished"? We wouldn't. We'd reserve that description for the neighbor who was behind on his mortgage and couldn't pay his creditors. Paul said: "The country's bankrupt." While ratings agencies have warned that the United States needs to put together a plan to reduce its deficit to hold onto its strong credit into the future, the country so far has paid its bills, which does not match the definition of being bankrupt. And while S&P lowered its rating a notch, two other agencies still give the U.S. the top grade for its ability to pay its bills. We rate his statement False.

pomt-02628	Travis County is "surrounded by red counties."	true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/21/lloyd-doggett/historically-blue-travis-county-surrounded-red-cou/	In a video endorsement of Andy Brown for Travis County judge, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett stressed the Austin lawyer’s past chairmanship of the county’s Democratic Party, adding: "I know he shares our values. He will stand up to the Republicans. We are surrounded by red counties." Six counties enwrap the capital’s county: Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays, Blanco, Burnet and Williamson. Unlike Democratic-blue Travis, are they all Republican-red? A standard way of gauging whether a state is red or blue, so to speak, is whether the Republican or Democratic nominee won the state in the latest presidential election. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried each of Travis County’s contiguous counties, drawing 54 percent to 77 percent of the vote, according to election results posted online by the state. Republican U.S. Senate nominee Ted Cruz similarly prevailed across the board, drawing 51 percent to 73 percent of each county’s vote. That November, Democrat Barack Obama won 60 percent of Travis County’s vote; Democratic Senate nominee Paul Sadler got 59 percent. Next, we scrolled presidential election results for the surrounding counties from 1992 through 2008. We largely saw red: The Republican nominee won Blanco, Burnet and Williamson counties all five elections. The nominee carried Hays County in all but 1992 and Bastrop and Caldwell counties from 2000 on. Separately, we asked the state parties how they would gauge the red or blue qualities of counties. By email, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, Steve Munisteri, said the party draws on a proprietary index for each county, its Optimal Republican Voting Strength or ORVS, which he described as based on a mathematical formula originated years ago. Munisteri said the ORVS draws on particular election results to indicate the percentage of the vote a party nominee would likely get in a general election in the best of circumstances. Munisteri sent us a chart indicating the ORVS for each of the six counties: Bastrop (56.2 percent); Blanco (72.5 percent); Burnet (74.3 percent); Caldwell (55 percent); Hays (56.2 percent); and Williamson (62.2 percent). By phone, Munisteri said the fact that Democrats have been elected to offices in some of the counties means the congressman’s claim isn’t entirely so. Election results for 2012 show local Democrats winning countywide races in two of the Travis-bordering counties, sometimes after they didn’t draw a Republican opponent. In 2010, Democrats won countywide offices in Bastrop, Caldwell and Hays counties. Let’s paw the details. In Bastrop County, according to 2012 results, a Republican won for county judge and the Democrats did not have a sheriff nominee. On the flip side, there was no Republican choice for county tax assessor-collector; Democrat Linda Harmon won without opposition. Two years earlier, Republicans won two contested county races, though a Democrat beat a Republican for county clerk, the results indicate. In Hays County, Republican victors in 2012 for sheriff and county tax assessor-collector ran unopposed, according to results emailed to us by Joyce Cowan, a county elections official. In 2010, Democrat Sherri Tibbe ran unopposed for criminal district attorney as Republican Bert Cobb defeated Democrat Jeff Barton for county judge, according to results. By telephone, Jon Leonard of the Hays County Democratic Party agreed that the county is red, though he expects Democratic candidates for statewide office to fare well there in November 2014; Obama, he pointed out, lost the county in 2008 by two percentage points. In Caldwell County, Democrats Daniel Law and Darla Law defeated Republicans to win 2012 races for sheriff and county tax assessor-collector, respectively, according to results emailed to us by a county official, Joy Morris Pardo. Two years before, victorious Democrats ran unopposed for the offices of criminal district attorney, county clerk, district clerk and county treasurer, though Republican Tom Bonn defeated Democrat Morris Alexander for county judge. In Burnet County, Democrats had no 2012 nominees for the several county offices, according to county-posted results. Two years earlier, several Republicans nominated for county offices (including county judge) lacked Democratic opponents. In the only red-blue 2010 showdown for county office, Republican Casie Wills handily defeated Democrat Cynthia Chisolm for district clerk. In Williamson County, according to county-posted results, Democrats had no 2012 nominee for sheriff as the losing Democratic nominee for district attorney garnered 40 percent against Republican Jana Duty. In 2010, Republicans cruised past Democrats for two contested county court-at-law judgeships. We did not obtain official records of Blanco County election results. But by telephone, Barbara Hudson, who chairs the county’s Democrats, told us that while the party seeks candidates to run countywide, for now, "we don’t even have Democrats who run for local offices." Our ruling Doggett said Travis County is "surrounded by red counties." That’s supported in each of the six counties by the outcome of presidential elections since 2000, though there has been some purpling in that Democrats won a few countywide offices in Bastrop, Caldwell and Hays counties in 2012 and 2010.

pomt-03397	In South Florida, "we've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/03/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-south-florida-weve-h/	Not long after President Barack Obama gave a speech outlining his plan for attacking climate change, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., appeared on Fox News to discuss the future of energy and the environment. "We've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s," said Wasserman Schultz in a June 28, 2013, interview with Tucker Carlson. "What that means is that communities like mine in South Florida and coastal communities all across the country are facing dangerous sea-level rise, which will ultimately cause homes to be under water in just a few short years." In this item, we won’t analyze her projections for future sea-level rises; such estimates are based on a variety of theoretical models and come with lots of uncertainty attached. However, we did wonder whether Wasserman Schultz was correct about past changes -- specifically, whether South Florida has "had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s." First, some background on sea-level rises. "Sea level" refers to the height of the ocean’s surface as measured either by a mechanical tide gauge (a method used since the 19th century) or, since the late 1990s, by satellite measurements. The kind of changes Wasserman Schultz mentioned are not short-term changes such as high tide and low tide, but rather average sea-level measurements taken over the course of many years. We located sea level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a variety of locations, including Miami Beach, Fla. Using tide gauge data from 1931 to 1981, NOAA found a change equivalent to 0.78 feet in 100 years. That's roughly nine inches since the 1920s. We checked with two scientists who specialize in sea-level measurements -- Gary B Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California-Santa Cruz, and Gary Mitchum, a physical oceanographer at the University of South Florida -- and both agreed that the NOAA data was an appropriate source for Wasserman Schultz to rely on. Both scientists considered her claim to be accurate. We will, however, offer two notes of caution when thinking about sea-level rise. One complication for making these measurements is that the land-based reference point for a tide gauge is not as fixed as it would seem to the naked eye. In reality, the land itself may be rising or falling, masking changes in sea level. For instance, in some places, such as Alaska or Scandinavia, the land is rising because it’s still rebounding from the retreat of heavy glaciers. In other locations, the slow action of plate tectonics is pushing the land upwards. The effect of land rises can be strong: In places like Alaska, the rise in the land has been faster than the rise in sea level, meaning that sea level is actually dropping in relative terms. By contrast, in Louisiana, the land is sinking due to a variety of landscape changes made by humans. With sea levels rising and the land sinking, the relative change in sea level is especially dramatic. South Florida fits somewhere between these two extremes. But because of the variability in land rise from place to place, it’s not appropriate to assume that just because sea level has risen by nine inches in Miami Beach that it has risen by the same amount everywhere. The second caveat is that past changes in sea level are a whole lot clearer than future changes. In a 2011 paper, Mitchum estimated that sea level in South Florida would rise 32 inches by 2100, with a smaller possibility of a 40-inch rise. However, other estimates have varied, and Mitchum cautions against assigning too much certainty to long-term estimates of sea-level rise. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that in South Florida, "we've had nine inches of sea-level rise since the 1920s." That essentially matches the data collected by the National Oceantic and Atmospheric Administration. While there is considerable uncertainty about the future course of sea-level rises, Wasserman Schultz’s estimate of the historical rise appears to be on target. We rate her statement True.

pomt-14860	"Wages adjusted for inflation haven’t risen since the turn of the last century."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/14/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-wages-havent-risen-turn-centu/	Much of the first part of the Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines addressed foreign policy, but soon the conversation turned to economic issues. At one point, Hillary Clinton was asked about how she would pay for such proposals as paid family leave. Clinton said she would not raise taxes on the middle class. "I have made very clear that hard-working, middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase," she said, adding that "wages adjusted for inflation haven’t risen since the turn of the last century." To check her assertion about stagnant wages, we turned to figures collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To take advantage of the most recent available data, we looked at figures for the third quarter of 2015. And to design the fairest comparison, we looked at third-quarter data for two different years -- 1999 and 2000 -- that could be used to describe the baseline "since the turn of the last century." To adhere to Clinton’s parameters, the figures below are all inflation-adjusted. Here’s what we found: Period Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, inflation-adjusted Third quarter, 1999 $315 Third quarter, 2000 $321 Third quarter, 2015 $340 This shows that wages didn’t rise very much above inflation over that period, though they did rise. Specifically, they rose about 8 percent between 1999 and 2015, and about 6 percent between 2000 and 2015. This is not very much of a rise over a 15-to 16-year period, as Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out when PolitiFact contacted the campaign. Still, it does undercut Clinton’s wording in the debate. We should note that this pattern didn’t simply start in 2000 -- it goes back to the 1970s and even the 1960s. As the Pew Research Center noted, using similar BLS data, "For most U.S. workers, real wages — that is, after inflation is taken into account — have been flat or even falling for decades, regardless of whether the economy has been adding or subtracting jobs." Specifically, Pew wrote, "in seasonally adjusted current dollars, median usual weekly earnings rose from $232 in the first quarter of 1979 (when the series began) to $782 in the second quarter of (2014, the most recent data available). But in (inflation-adjusted) terms, the median has barely budged over that period." The paper added that what gains have been made over that period have accrued to the upper-income brackets. "Since 2000, usual weekly wages have fallen 3.7 percent (in real terms) among workers in the lowest tenth of the earnings distribution, and 3 percent among the lowest quarter," Pew wrote. "But among people near the top of the distribution, real wages have risen 9.7 percent." Our ruling Clinton said that "wages adjusted for inflation haven’t risen since the turn of the last century." They didn’t rise by much -- roughly half a percentage point per year above inflation over the past decade and a half -- but they did rise. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-11672	"Breaking: FBI just raided the White House, 6 people thrown out."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/05/new-century-times/white-house-staffers-removed-job-subject-false/	A misleading story on Facebook said that an FBI raid led to White House staffers losing their jobs. "Breaking: FBI just raided the White House, 6 people thrown out," stated a headline by the New Century Times, a left-leaning website, on Dec. 30. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While staffers were removed from the White House, that happened nearly a year ago and by calling it a "raid" over dramatizes the actual news. The same story appeared on another website in February. The story by New Century Times said that an intelligence agency decided to fight back and sent Trump a message by escorting six staffers out of the White House for failing background investigations. By calling the event an "FBI raid" it conjures up an image of armed personnel storming the White House to take out suspicious staffers. But that’s not the way it sounded in news reports. The website attributed much of the information to Western Journalism, which describes itself as a source of conservative and libertarian news. In reality, the story traces back to an article in Politico. Western Journalism reported Feb. 16 that the six staffers were escorted from the White House for problems with their SF86 application, a questionnaire for national security positions. The questionnaire, more than 100 pages long, includes questions on the applicant’s employment, criminal and residential history and also asks about personal subjects such as about an applicant’s mental health and use of illicit drugs. The Western Journalism article followed an article by Politico, which reported based on unnamed sources that some of the aides were "walked out of the building by security." One of the six staffers was Caroline Wiles, the daughter of Susan Wiles, Trump’s Florida campaign director, Politico reported. Caroline Wiles, who resigned before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She was slated to get another job in Treasury. Our ruling The website New Century Times said in a December headline that "Breaking: FBI just raided the White House, 6 people thrown out." Yes, six White House staffers were removed from their jobs due to problems associated with their in depth background checks, Politico reported. But their removals occurred in February -- this isn’t "breaking" news in December. And it seems a stretch to describe the removals as an FBI "raid." We rate this claim False.

pomt-03206	"I am every year the No.1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas."	false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/27/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-claim-misses-his-annually-being-no-1-pick/	In a Dallas-area call on behalf of a jailed niece, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said Texas law enforcement agencies consistently rank him fairest of them all. In his Aug. 3, 2013, call to the Allen Police Department, a recording of which was later released in response to a request from NBC 5, KXAS-TV, Dewhurst inquired into what he needed to do to hasten the release of Ellen Bevers, described in the station’s news report as a schoolteacher detained for allegedly shoplifting at a grocery store. His call did not yield special treatment; Bevers was released after posting bond the next day, according to an Aug. 22, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. But critics including Dewhurst challengers in the 2014 Republican primary charged him with trying to throw his weight around. Readers zeroed in on a curious Dewhurst claim. "Sergeant, you don't know me," Dewhurst is heard saying on the police call, "but I am every year the No.1 pick of all of the law enforcement agencies within Texas." First and foremost? Agencies do not rank officeholders, we found, though law officer associations make candidate endorsements as do other advocacy groups with an interest in what happens in government. By email, Dewhurst spokesman Travis Considine pointed out that Dewhurst was endorsed by several officer groups in his 2006 re-election race and in his 2012 U.S. Senate race. Also, Considine noted, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas deemed Dewhurst its Texas Crime Fighter of the Year in 2003, his first year in what many consider the state’s most powerful post. A Nov. 24, 2003, association press release credits Dewhurst with steering reforms in drunken-driving laws and helping on other measures. CLEAT spokesman Charlie Wilkison is quoted describing Dewhurst as a "real friend" to the state’s law enforcement community. By telephone, Wilkison, poised to become the group’s executive director, told us that in 2012 the association gave Dewhurst a lifetime achievement award thanks to his consistent support over the years. Especially notable, Wilkison said, Dewhurst has repeatedly volunteered to keynote a biennial Texas Capitol ceremony honoring fallen officers at which he comforts survivors including children, one by one. Wilkison said he believes that in the call to the police department, Dewhurst meant to say he was No. 1 with law enforcement groups, instead making a common semantic mistake by saying "agencies." Like representatives of other law enforcement advocacy groups that have supported Dewhurst in elections, Wilkison agreed that agencies do not rank officeholders; the agencies are supposed to be politically disinterested. Kevin Lawrence, executive director of the Texas Municipal Police Association, another influential group, said by phone that it has enjoyed a great relationship with Dewhurst. "Law enforcement agencies have no business endorsing candidates," Lawrence said, and while associations or unions make candidate endorsements, they do not pick one officeholder over another--assigning ranks, that is--unless the officeholders face each other on the ballot. "Associations don’t sit around saying who is our favorite politician," Lawrence said. Gary Chandler, a Department of Public Safety sergeant and president of the DPS Officers Association, later said by phone: "We don’t rank the government officials or public officials," instead focusing on trooper salaries and benefits. Then again, Chandler said: "As government works, the lieutenant governor of Texas is a very powerful person. We have worked with David Dewhurst the last three" legislative "sessions at least." He said that personally, Dewhurst "has been my No. 1 guy," though every legislator "is important to us when it comes to accomplishing our goals… I wouldn’t mind calling them all No. 1 at some point." Lacking any sign of agencies ranking officeholders, we turned back to Considine, who said the cited endorsements demonstrate Dewhurst's appeal to law enforcement organizations. Our ruling Dewhurst said that "every year, I'm the No.1 pick of all the law enforcement agencies in Texas." This declaration falters in substantive ways. Law enforcement agencies do not rank elected officials against one another in any way. Nor do law enforcement advocacy groups, though Dewhurst has drawn multiple re-election endorsements. Then again, such endorsements do not occur every year. The election for lieutenant governor occurs every four years. We rate this claim as False. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-01478	Health insurance costs for Floridians are up 30 percent or more.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/29/republican-party-florida/health-insurance-costs-are-skyrocketing-under-obam/	Got a beef with Obamacare? The Republicans want to remind voters that Democrat Charlie Crist thinks the president’s health care law is "great." A TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida features anecdotes from people making claims about how the health care law has hurt them in the pocketbook or made it harder to find doctors: "I think Obamacare harms doctors and patients." "It increased my health policy, personal health policy, 30 percent." "I’m disabled and I can’t find doctors that will help me." "My family’s medical costs have doubled." "Many doctors are losing their patients, and patients are losing their doctors. I was one of them." "Obamacare hurts my ability to create jobs." The ad soon pivots to Crist saying of Obamacare "I think it’s been great," comments he made in a TV interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley in March 2014. Crist has campaigned in favor of the federal health care law while his opponent Republican Gov. Rick Scott has been a major critic. The ad doesn’t identify the various men and women complaining about Obamacare making it impossible to verify each individual’s experiences. State GOP spokesperson Susan Hepworth’s only reply to our questions about the people and their insurance woes: "They are not actors." But we can research the ad’s overall message that the Affordable Care Act has inflated Floridians’ health care costs anywhere from 30 percent to twice as expensive. Data about rising premiums There have been various studies about average premium increases since the health care law was implemented, but the results vary widely depending on the methodology and available information. The studies we saw that cited larger increases were generally based on the individual or small-group market and not the category of large-group employer plans. Some predictions that came from Florida officials were based on a hypothetical plan that wasn’t even for sale in the state. The Republicans cited a few surveys showing higher prices. For example, a national survey by the investment firm Morgan Stanley showed Florida was seeing a 36.8 percent increase for individual plans and 20.7 percent increase for small group plans based on the response of six insurance brokers. But large-group plans were not included in the study, even though those typically represent the most commonly held form of insurance. (PolitiFact New Hampshire noted this in their state as well.) Individual plans, and to a lesser extent small-group plans, have long been expected to produce larger premium increases than large-group plans. That’s because existing individual- and small-group policies likely didn’t include many of the law’s new minimum requirements, such as preventive care with no cost-sharing. When the policies had to change, premiums were likely to rise. Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading health policy research center, has said there are several reasons not to compare costs before and after Obamacare. Part of the challenge again is how policies have new coverage requirements, such as maternity care and mental health coverage. The plans people are buying in 2014 are not the same as what they may have bought last year. In 2013, Kaiser explained that overall average unsubsidized premiums for nongroup coverage would be higher because "many people will be getting better insurance." Kaiser didn’t have a breakdown by state, but reported national data in September 2014 that showed average annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health coverage rose 3 percent. A 2014 Kaiser survey found that nearly half (46 percent) of those who previously bought non-group insurance and switched to a subsidized, ACA-compliant plan said their current premium is lower than it was under their previous plan, while four in 10 (39 percent) say it is higher. The rate at which those premiums changed is a question mark because of how each study measured whatever they measured, but the anonymous examples cited in the commercial sound extreme to some experts. "While it would not be impossible for a consumer to experience a ‘30 percent increase’ in his ‘health care policy,’ that situation would unquestionably be an extreme outlier," said Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, a consumer health advocacy group. "The doubling of ‘medical costs’ would be even more extreme. Representing those consumers as typical Floridians would therefore be grossly misleading." So what are typical premium numbers? PricewaterhouseCoopers released data in August 2014 on individual market rate filings based on state insurance department rate filings and public statements. PWC found a 7.4 percent increase for Florida, a hair above the national 7 percent increase. The report cited a broad range of rate increases in some states and noted that they would likely shrink after regulators reviewed them. Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation and the White House released different information regarding premium costs in August. The Miami Herald wrote that Florida officials said rates would rise an average of 13.2 percent for new plans in the individual market next year, while the White House said most Floridians who buy an Obamacare plan will pay less in monthly premiums. How can that be? Because they’re each doing different math in order to prove their points. The Florida insurance office, an agency working for a Republican governor and GOP-led Legislature that is against the Affordable Care Act, calculated the average on individual health plans on both the private market and the health exchange, leading to that 13.2 percent rise, the Herald pointed out. The White House was only counting the second-lowest priced silver plan on the exchange in each Florida county. That method predicted an average 4 percent drop in monthly premiums. "The bottom line is that there is absolutely no way to assess the ad without knowing where the person came from (pre-ACA insurance) and something about their health needs," Caroline Pearson, a vice president at health care consulting firm Avalere, told PolitiFact Florida. "Generally, most people in exchanges were previously uninsured or in the individual market. Most of those people will have much better coverage post ACA, but there are absolutely examples of healthy people whose costs will go up." Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid for President George H.W. Bush, said there still are some groups who may have seen substantial increases in their premiums. "These are individuals or couples who had purchased individual insurance tailored to their needs and who were forced to buy more comprehensive and therefore expensive plans," she said. Wilensky added that last fall there were many complaints from single people and older couples who had to buy policies with those new requirements. They didn’t need things like maternity care and full dental plans for children, but their premiums went up anyway. However, most people who have bought insurance were those who were eligible to get substantial subsidies, she said. In response to the Republicans’ ad, the Crist campaign sent reporters a copy of a recent Tampa Bay Times editorial that cited numbers that show health care reform is working in Florida -- including that nearly 1 million have elected to get a plan through the federal marketplace. Our ruling The Republicans’ ad shows several unidentified people saying that health insurance costs for Floridians are up 30 percent or more. Many reports that cite big double-digit premium increases are based on individual or small-group plans and omit large group plans, the type of coverage many people have through work. Kaiser concluded that in large-group plans, the largest segment in the market, premiums will rise 3 percent. The Republicans’ ad takes anecdotal experiences about cost increases that would be rare but potentially true and creates the impression that the federal health care law is just one big heap of problems for patients without any benefits. Then it tells voters that despite that morass, Crist supports it. People may see increases to their health care costs under the law, but the typical experience is nowhere near what the ad suggests. Indeed, other Floridians will see their costs go down. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2014-09-29T11:26:51	2014-09-23	['None']
pomt-10707	Romney failed to take action against "sanctuary cities" in Massachusetts.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/28/rudy-giuliani/right-facts-but-they-dont-prove-romney-weak-on-imm/	The Giuliani campaign has responded several times to Romney's attacks on "sanctuary cities" by alleging that it was Romney who was weak on immigration because he did not speak up or take action against Massachusetts cities that had similar policies to New York's. Giuliani is on solid ground with this attack. There's no evidence that Romney spoke up or took action against those cities. But Romney's inaction does not necessarily confirm the Giuliani campaign's larger point –- that Romney was soft on illegal immigration. Late in his term, Romney approved a plan to deputize state troopers to help enforce immigration laws, although the plan was not implemented because it was rescinded by his successor, Gov. Deval Patrick. We expect to see this allegation repeated as the campaign goes on, though. The Giuliani campaign has apparently been searching for cities with policies of not turning in illegal immigrants; they recently upped their count of Massachusetts sanctuary cities from three to six. We rate Giuliani's claim as Mostly True because, although the facts are right, there's not enough evidence to back up Giuliani's larger point that Romney was not aggressive on illegal immigration.

pomt-15245	"Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood) pregnancy services were abortions."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/04/sandra-smith/fox-business-reporter-95-planned-parenthoods-pregn/	Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee supports the federal government cutting off more than $500 million to Planned Parenthood, calling the organization "an industry of abortion" in a recent Fox Business Channel interview. His interviewer, Fox Business reporter Sandra Smith, did not disagree — and she offered numbers to back up her point. "Almost 95 percent of all their pregnancy services were abortions," Smith said as she guest-hosted Mornings with Maria on July 28, 2015. We wanted to know if the percentage of abortions was really that high. We reached out to Smith for comment but did not hear back. 'Pregnancy services' Viewers may miss that Smith’s statement refers only to "pregnancy services." By choosing those words, she is likely referencing a fact sheet by the Susan B. Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion and supports anti-abortion candidates. The Susan B. Anthony List’s numbers derive from Planned Parenthood’s 2013-14 annual report. The first caveat to know is that Planned Parenthood does not have a category for "pregnancy services." That’s a category the Susan B. Anthony List created, and the background reasoning has been the same as similarly misleading claims over the years. On the fact sheet, "pregnancy services" are broken down into three categories: abortions, prenatal care and adoption referrals. Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said these are the three ways a woman can respond to a pregnancy. With that in mind, here’s the section from Planned Parenthood’s annual report that contains those categories. To arrive at the Susan B. Anthony List figure, you have to tease out specific elements from the chart: prenatal services (18,684), adoption referrals (1,880) and abortions (327,653). Abortions account for 94 percent of the sum of these subcategories. For several reasons, that’s a misleading way to analyze the data. Referrals for prenatal care not in equation Not all of Planned Parenthood approximately 700 clinics offer prenatal services because prenatal care is not Planned Parenthood's focus. As a result, many pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians or other health providers for prenatal care. How many? It's impossible to know. Planned Parenthood does not record how many pregnant patients are referred to outside health care providers, said Elizabeth Clark, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman. If referrals were included, the 95 percent figure would likely change, though we can't say by how much — and neither can Smith nor the Susan B. Anthony List. The rest of the story Planned Parenthood does not specifically track of the number of pregnant women who come into clinics for other reasons. And many of Planned Parenthood's services are not related to prenatal care, abortion or adoption. Testing and treatment for sexually transmitted disease and infection, both for men and women, accounts for the largest share of services provided by Planned Parenthood at more than 4.47 million. Contraception, which includes birth control, emergency contraception kits, and sterilization and vasectomy procedures, accounts for more than 3.58 million services. Different types of cancer screening and prevention, including breast exams, account for 935,573 services. As show on the chart above, there were also more than 1.1 million pregnancy tests, 47,2000 urinary tract infection treatments, or 65,500 "family practice services." Over the course of 2013-14, Planned Parenthood performed more than 10.5 million services. Sometimes patients are double-counted because they receive multiple services. Put another way. Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients that year. Of all services, abortions account for 3 percent of services performed, said Erica Sackin, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, pointing to page 18 of the report. But looking at the share of abortions per patient (and assuming one procedure per patient), the figure rises to 12 percent. Some critics have taken issue with Planned Parenthood’s measurement of "services." Performing an abortion is more involved than administering pregnancy tests or giving someone a contraception kit, for example. The share of abortions might be different if cost or hours of services were used. (However, that information is not in the 2013-14 annual report.) Our ruling Smith said, "Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood's) pregnancy services were abortions." An anti-abortion group puts the figure at 94 percent using a cherry-picked method that ignores the majority of Planned Parenthood's services, which aim to prevent pregnancies. The group describes "pregnancy services" as counting what Planned Parenthood does for women once they are already pregnant. But Planned Parenthood does not fully track this number, making the claim a leap of logic based on insufficient information. What's most noticeably missing among the number of Planned Parenthood services used by pregnant women are the number of pregnancy referrals. Planned Parenthood says it doesn't keep records of how many pregnant women are referred to outside healthcare providers. Without that information, we don't know an accurate percentage of "pregnancy services" that were abortions. Neither, however, does Smith. We rate the claim False. UPDATE: After this fact-check published, an official with Planned Parenthood contacted us and said that she was not authorized to speak on the record. A spokeswoman who is authorized to speak on the record, Elizabeth Clark, then provided us the same information. We've updated this fact-check to include her comments.

pomt-01586	Says his comment about extremists being a JV team "wasn’t specifically referring to" Islamic State.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/07/barack-obama/what-obama-said-about-islamic-state-jv-team/	President Barack Obama granted an exclusive sit down to Meet the Press for new host Chuck Todd’s inaugural show. As expected, Todd and Obama had a long discussion about the administration’s strategy for dealing with Islamic State, the terrorist group responsible for the beheading of two American journalists, with Obama stating "we’re going to defeat them." Todd then remarked that Obama’s response was a "long way from when you described them as a JV team." "Was that bad intelligence or your misjudgment?" Todd asked. "Keep in mind I wasn’t specifically referring to (Islamic State)," Obama replied. "I've said that, regionally, there were a whole series of organizations that were focused primarily locally, weren’t focused on homeland, because I think a lot of us, when we think about terrorism, the model is Osama bin Laden and 9/11." Is Obama editing his remarks or did Todd misrepresent what Obama said? We decided to take a look. Critics have maligned Obama’s "JV" remark in recent weeks as the Islamic State continues to wreak havoc throughout Syria and Iraq. The origin of the comment is a New Yorker profile of Obama by editor David Remnick. The New Yorker published Remnick’s profile on Jan. 27, 2014. In it, he wrote, "In the 2012 campaign, Obama spoke not only of killing Osama bin Laden; he also said that Al Qaeda had been ‘decimated.’ I pointed out that the flag of Al Qaeda is now flying in Fallujah, in Iraq, and among various rebel factions in Syria; Al Qaeda has asserted a presence in parts of Africa, too." Obama responded: "The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant." (For the nonsports fan, JV stands for junior varsity, and it usually means a high school or college's secondary team.) Remnick confirmed to PolitiFact that the interview took place on Jan. 7 and he was referencing a specific event that had happened just days before: the overtaking of the Iraq city of Fallujah on Jan. 3. At the time, Islamic State (often referred to as by its acronyms ISIS or ISIL) was not a household name. It was often referred to as an al-Qaeda-linked group in press reports. But reports from the time clearly indicate that the group was responsible for taking over the city. Al Jazeera America reported on Jan. 4: "On Friday, ISIL gunmen sought to win over the population in Fallujah, one of the cities they swept into on Wednesday. A commander appeared among worshippers holding Friday prayers in the main city street, proclaiming that his fighters were there to defend Sunnis from the government, one resident said. " ‘We are your brothers from the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant,’ gunmen circulating through the city in a stolen police car proclaimed through a loudspeaker. ‘We are here to protect you from the government. We call on you to cooperate with us.’ " Officials within the Iraqi government told the "Agence France-Presse that ISIL, the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, remained in control of parts of the two cities on Thursday," according to NBC. So when Remnick referenced an al Qaeda group taking over Fallujah, it’s clear whom he was talking about. On Aug. 25, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest claimed Obama’s comment was being taken out of context and that the "president was not singling out" Islamic State in that interview, but rather Islamic extremist groups in general. The Washington Post Fact-Checker compared that with the previously unreleased transcript and gave Earnest’s comment four Pinocchios, his worst rating. (For what it’s worth, Remnick told PolitiFact that the Post fact-check "got it right.") A transcript of the conversation provided to the Post (and verified by Remnick) also confirms as much. Remnick: "You know where this is going, though. Even in the period that you’ve been on vacation in the last couple of weeks, in Iraq, in Syria, of course, in Africa, al-Qaeda is resurgent." Obama: "Yes, but, David, I think the analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant. I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian." Remnick: "But that JV team just took over Fallujah." Obama: "I understand. But when you say took over Fallujah –" Remnick: "And I don’t know for how long." Obama: "But let’s just keep in mind, Fallujah is a profoundly conservative Sunni city in a country that, independent of anything we do, is deeply divided along sectarian lines. And how we think about terrorism has to be defined and specific enough that it doesn’t lead us to think that any horrible actions that take place around the world that are motivated in part by an extremist Islamic ideology is a direct threat to us or something that we have to wade into." This pretty much leaves no doubt. Obama may not have specifically said Islamic State, but it’s clear he was talking about them. Remnick was referencing events in Syria and Iraq, particularly the takeover of Fallujah, which was conducted by Islamic State, and Obama referred to the group responsible for that as "a JV team." Our ruling Obama said his JV comment "wasn’t specifically referring to ISIL." He was not specifically asked about Islamic State, but it’s pretty clear this is the group that was being referenced in the conversation. The transcript backs this up, as do news events from the time of the discussion. We rate the statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-09-07T18:14:11	2014-09-07	['None']
pomt-04213	"National studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy. Businesses across the country are raising their prices … (or) cutting jobs as a result of the added cost."	false	/florida/statements/2012/nov/30/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-said-national-studies-show-businesses-ar/	Some Florida public officials, including Gov. Rick Scott, have softened their tone on the federal health care law since the U.S. Supreme Court declared it constitutional and President Barack Obama was re-elected. But don’t count Attorney General Pam Bondi among those officials. In remarks at a Florida Chamber of Commerce event Nov. 28, 2012, Bondi said the health care law is already hurting businesses. "Unfortunately, national studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy. Businesses across the country are raising their prices in order to compensate for their added costs due to Obama’s health care plan. If they aren’t raising prices, they’re cutting jobs as a result of the added cost, both of which hurt our economy. According to a Mercer survey, more than 60 percent of employers expect the federal health care plan to increase their health costs. Twenty percent of those employers are bracing for at least a 5 percent increase in costs." This comment caught our attention because added costs for business under the health care law do not start until 2014. So why would they be raising prices and cutting jobs now? First, a bit of background: In 2014, the law’s major requirements take effect. Individuals will have to have health insurance or pay a penalty. And large employers will have to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. Employers with fewer than 50 employees are exempt, and large employers that already offer health insurance are not affected. Translation: Most large employers who don’t offer their employees health insurance will be subject to the penalty. But again, those penalties haven’t started yet, which made us question Bondi’s statement that businesses "are raising prices" and "cutting jobs" as a result of the law. Employers have seen some new requirements since the law went into effect. One requirement that has started is that parents be allowed to add adult children to their policies. Another regulation forbids caps on how much insurance will pay over the course of someone’s lifetime. But we didn’t find evidence of these regulations leading to higher prices or eliminated jobs. We contacted Bondi’s office and asked for evidence of Bondi’s remarks. They provided the Mercer survey that Bondi mentioned, as well as news reports on businesses preparing for the health care law’s requirements. We’ll review that evidence here. The Mercer survey We contacted Mercer, a health care consulting company, and obtained the survey Bondi referenced. It was conducted two weeks after the Supreme Court decision and queried 1,215 employers of various sizes. As Bondi said, the survey found that 61 percent of employers expected cost increases. Employers were asked to estimate the cost impact of the health law’s key provisions that go into effect in 2014. Here are the survey’s findings on costs: * 10 percent of employers said they expected no increase in costs; * 10 percent of employers said they expected a less than 1 percent increase in costs; * 17 percent of employers said they expected a 1 to 2 percent increase in costs; * 14 percent of employers said they expected a 3 to 4 percent increase in costs; * 20 percent of employers said they expected a 5 percent or more increase in costs; * 29 percent of employers said they didn’t know what to expect. So Bondi is correct on the specific numbers she cited. However, she was selective in quoting the survey’s findings. For example, another way to read the results is that 51 percent of employers expected their costs to go up 4 percent or less. A spokesperson for Mercer told us their surveys show employers are actually lowering their estimates of the cost impact as the law’s actual implementation gets closer. Finally, we should note that the Mercer survey asked employers to predict what they thought would happen in 2014. It did not ask employers about how the law is affecting their actions today. And it did not show that businesses are raising their prices or laying off workers, as Bondi suggested. News coverage Bondi’s office also pointed us to news stories about how businesses are reacting to the health care law, reports from conservative think tanks and opinion pieces from conservative outlets that oppose the law. The most relevant and persuasive evidence that the law would raise prices or cause layoffs were news stories about how the law would affect the restaurant industry. Franchise owners for restaurants such as Papa John’s have said they intend to reduce workers’ hours or add surcharges to their food in order to comply with the health care law’s requirements. The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 3, 2012, that companies such as Darden Restaurants of Orlando, which runs Red Lobster and Olive Garden, were shifting their workforce from full-timers to part-timers to try to avoid paying penalties. We found this evidence interesting, but anecdotal, and not definitive. The chief executive officer for Papa John’s, for example, wrote an op-ed for the Huffington Post to correct reports that the pizza chain was laying off workers. "Many in the media reported that I said Papa John's is going to close stores and cut jobs because of Obamacare. I never said that," wrote John Schnatter on Nov. 20, 2012. "The fact is we are going to open over hundreds of stores this year and next and increase employment by over 5,000 jobs worldwide. And, we have no plans to cut team hours as a result of the Affordable Care Act." Still, we found no large-scale studies showing that many businesses are currently raising prices or laying off workers to prepare for the health law. In 2010, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office studied the law’s effects on the nationwide labor force and found the effects would be minimal. Also, most of the economic effects of the law would happen after the provisions took effect, not before. "To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced," the CBO said in its report. "It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives." Our ruling Bondi said, "National studies are already showing the negative effects that the health care law is having on businesses and our economy. Businesses across the country are raising their prices … (or) cutting jobs as a result of the added cost." It’s true that some large businesses -- specifically, those with more than 50 employees who do not currently offer their employees health insurance -- will face new costs because of the health care law. Starting in 2014, they will have to offer their employees health insurance or pay a financial penalty to the federal government. But Bondi’s comments ignore two points: These requirements haven’t taken effect yet, and it’s not clear whether businesses will find themselves forced to raise prices or cut jobs. We found no credible national studies showing these widespread effects, and certainly not showing those effects right now. We don’t doubt there’s anxiety among some businesses over what’s to come under the health care law, and maybe some are talking about whether they’ll have to raise prices or cut jobs. But Bondi didn’t talk about planning, she talked about what’s occuring right now, and we find no studies already showing the negative effects or evidence that businesses are cutting jobs or raising prices now. We rate Bondi’s statement False.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2012-11-30T14:52:16	2012-11-28	['None']
pomt-05684	Says her accomplishments include "a fiscally responsible budget agreement that controls state spending."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/14/chris-telfer/can-chris-telfer-claim-credit-budget-re-balance-cl/	Like other savvy politicians, state Sen. Chris Telfer, R-Bend, issued a press release via the caucus office crediting herself for her accomplishments in the 2012 legislative session: Senator Chris Telfer (R-Bend) wrestled several important successes from Oregon’s first annual session, which ended Monday evening. Among her accomplishments are two substantial job-creating bills and a fiscally responsible budget agreement that controls state spending. Innocuous enough, right? Except that the press release prompted this tweet from a colleague of PolitiFact Oregon: OR Sen. Telfer, R-Bend, takes credit for "fiscally responsible budget" -- which she voted against. Whoa. That got our attention. What’s the story? We found there were votes on five budget related bills Monday, the last day of the 2012 legislative session. Telfer voted in favor of bonding and capital construction, but voted against operating money to run state government. The key bill was Senate Bill 5701, the "omnibus budget reconciliation bill" that reflects the bulk of the agreement struck by House and Senate budget negotiators. Nine Republicans in the Senate voted no, including Telfer. Senate Bill 5702 allocates the other part of state general fund: state lottery money. Two Republicans voted no, including Telfer. Telfer is a certified public accountant who is not on the Ways and Means Committee. She said on the floor that the budget bills were important bills, but she didn’t receive them in time to vet them properly. She also said that there is extra money on the books that state agencies are hiding from lawmakers. "Just letting everybody know that I will be no on all the budget bills," she said on the floor. We reached Telfer by telephone. She said she did not write the press release, but did review it and she stands by the statement. She said the budget agreement struck by the three budget writers reflects her stance on trimming state personnel and opposing new taxes. She said she was in frequent contact with the office of Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, the Republican in the meetings. Her no votes were an opportunity to send a message to fellow lawmakers, Telfer said. "It’s a budget I can live with," she said, "but I certainly think there were lots of faults with the budget." To be fair, the press release went on to talk about her advocacy for "budget transparency and accountability" and that she fought "to end runaway state spending and successfully lobbied against new taxes and fees increases." In other words, the release was candid about the general nature of her role. But the statement specifically cites "among her accomplishments are … a fiscally responsible budget agreement that controls state spending." Telfer didn’t negotiate, or help negotiate, that agreement. Not only that, she voted against the bills that authorize operating money for state government. Her statement is not accurate and it makes a ridiculous claim. We rule the statement Pants on Fire. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.

pomt-01886	"13 percent of Americans, the lowest ever, are without health care."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/08/donny-deutsch/uninsured-rate-lowest-ever-donny-deutsch-claims/	Morning Joe guest host Donny Deutsch, discussing House Speaker John Boehner’s refusal to vote on immigration reform, called out the GOP for being wrong about, well, just about everything. "Once again the party of no," Deutsch said on July 1, 2014. "The country’s will was for immigration reform, they're against it. Minimum wage, we want to raise it for everybody, another populist point of view. They don't want to do it. By the way, 13 percent of Americans, the lowest ever, are without health care. Everything is going in the right direction." While there are several things we could fact-check from Deutsch’s comments, we were most interested in his claim that 13 percent of Americans are currently uninsured -- the lowest that figure has ever been. The poll numbers Neither Deutsch nor his press agent responded to our interview requests. But it’s likely that Deutsch is referring to a Gallup poll on the rate of uninsured Americans. The poll found that in April and May of this year, 13.4 percent of Americans were without health insurance, holding steady since open enrollment for coverage ended March 31. This is indeed the lowest rate of uninsured Americans since the poll began five years ago, besting 2008’s 14.4 percent and dropping from 2013’s peak of 18 percent. The problem is, Gallup doesn’t have numbers before 2008 -- which means there’s no way to know if it’s the lowest rate ever as Deutsch claimed. Other surveys, including from the government, also attempt to measure the percentage of Americans without health insurance. According to those surveys, the percentage of Americans without health insurance has been lower than the 13.4 percent cited by Gallup: 2001: 13.1 percent (Department of Health and Human Services National Health Survey) 2000: 13.1 percent (Census Population Survey), 13.3 percent (National Health Survey) 1999: 12.2 percent (National Health Survey) 1998: 13.3 percent (National Health Survey) 1988: 13.4 percent (Population Survey) 1987: 12.9 percent (Population Survey) 1980: 12 percent (Health and Human Services Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) 1978: 12 percent (Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) While the percentages suggest the current uninsured rate is hardly the "lowest ever" reported, it should be noted that it is ill-advised to compare across the polls because of the differences in methodology and timing. Gallup surveys adult Americans multiple times a year about their health insurance at the time of the survey. Gallup analyst Jeff Jones confirmed that the exact question asked was simply "do you have health insurance"? Census data, which hasn’t caught up to Obamacare implementation, includes Americans of all ages, though both broadly define "uninsured" as lacking insurance at any time of the year. The Health and Human Services surveys only consider nonelderly adults (under 65), includes those with only noncomprehensive plans as "uninsured" (i.e. dental or vision, coverage for accidents or specific diseases), and differentiates between uninsured any time in the year, for the first part of the year, and the full year. And to make matters more complicated, the Census Bureau is changing the way it collects information on the uninsured. That means new Census Bureau data will not be comparable to old Census Bureau data. In short, year-to-year data comparisons may be a moot point so let’s look at the bigger picture. Historical trends First off, insurance coverage, let alone coverage figures, simply doesn’t go all the way back to the all-elusive "ever." In fact, it didn’t really exist before the 1920s. The closest thing offered was "sickness" insurance, which paid a worker even if he/she had to take a day off due to illness -- essentially paid sick leave. According to political economist John Murray, about a third of the industrial workforce was enrolled in these sickness funds in the 1920s. In 1929, the first insurance plan in America covered 21 days of hospitalization and was offered to Dallas teachers by Baylor University for an annual fee of $6 (about $82 today). This plan, named Blue Cross, became popular during the Great Depression. In 1940, less than 1 in 10 Americans had the plan, said economic historian Melissa Thomasson. The next two decades saw an expansion of employer-sponsored plans, incentivized by Internal Revenue Bureau Code 1954’s tax subsidy, according to Thomasson. This accounts for the employer-sponsored coverage system we all know and love today. "Most plans were employer based and always have been because insurance companies then and now figured that only sick people would want health insurance and the plans would not be sound. This is a problem called adverse selection," said Thomasson. By 1959, about two-thirds of Americans were insured, according to the Department of Health and Human Services National Health Survey, though historical rates of coverage for the elderly were low. "Insurers could not figure out how to cover people who made lots of claims and retirees often lost their employer-provided insurance when they retired. So Medicare would have resulted in large increases in coverage," Murray said. With the creation of social safety net programs in 1965 -- Medicare for the elderly (over 65) and Medicaid for the poor -- more than 80 percent were insured by 1968. That same year, 96 percent of the elderly were insured, more than double that of a decade earlier. Health and Human Services data show a decline in the percentage of uninsured nonelderly Americans from 1959 to 1980. Then, the rates began to climb, level off in the 90s, and then rise substantially circa the Great Recession. Again, this is because it all ties back to the employment-sponsored system of insurance, experts say. The higher the employment ratio is, the higher the insurance rate. But Medicaid and the recent trend of employers not offering coverage complicates this relationship. "Unemployment doesn’t come with health insurance, unless one is poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The 1990s was a decade of high and rising employment, and that boosted insurance coverage," said Brookings Institution senior fellow Henry Aaron. "During the 2000s the employment population ratio fell and employers continued to move gradually away from offering coverage. So, both trends were negative." As a result, all the polls we looked at indicated that post-Great Recession uninsured rates hovered above 14 percent. And though the unemployment rate has fallen in the 2010s, the employment ratio has not. Martha Heberlein, research manager at Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, and Aaron both cite Congressional Budget Office projections of the uninsured rate leveling off in the next few years at 8 to 9 percent. Obamacare won’t be universal technically because of undocumented aliens, those excused from the mandate, and those who remain uninsured and pay a fine. Heberlein adds that the rate could decline even further if more states adopt Medicaid expansion. "I think that the key point is not whether the insurance percentage is or is not at an all-time low today. The key points are that the Affordable Care Act reversed an upward trend and has done so emphatically and if the projections of the Congressional Budget Office are even approximately correct, the percentage will come down still more," Aaron said. The ruling Deutsch claimed that 13 percent of Americans, the lowest ever, are without health care. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Yes, it is the lowest that Gallup has reported in its five-year poll, though other equally valid surveys show lower rates before 2008. Nonetheless, experts agree that more Americans are insured than there were in the past couple of years. Whether that’s the lowest ever is hard to say. We rate Deutsch’s statement Half True.

pomt-04229	Says Delta Air Lines has "once again broken a promise they made to me and to the people of Memphis."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/nov/25/steve-cohen/delta-broke-promises-memphis-says-congressman-cohe/	When the merger of Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines was under consideration in 2008, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., was skeptical of the deal. While noting that the Memphis Airport Authority and the Memphis Chamber of Commerce backed it, Cohen sought some assurances from those seeking to implement it. The Memphis congressmen is now assailing Delta, which has grown very unpopular in the region while flights are cut and fares are raised, for failing to live up to those assurances. Cohen put out a press release Oct. 31 saying some of the assurances he received were misrepresentations and "that Delta has once again broken a promise they made to me and to the people of Memphis." The release’s opening paragraph referred to a "string of broken promises," so we decided to look at the history and determine if Cohen is accurately representing the company’s record. Cohen’s office provided hearing transcripts and press accounts. In one, the CEO of Delta, Richard H. Anderson, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee’s task force on antitrust laws in April 2008, and Cohen was there to question him. Anderson, who had served as a senior vice president for labor relations at Northwest in the early 1990s, noted that he’d spent "many days in Memphis" and was "instrumental in launching the service from Memphis to Amsterdam some, I guess, 10 years ago now." Cohen: "The Amsterdam flight would remain, I presume?" Anderson: "Yes." The Delta-Northwest merger was announced on April 14, 2008, and the boards of the two companies approved terms of the deal in September of that year. It received regulatory approval from the Justice Department’s antitrust division and from European regulators. Delta announced in March of this year that the flight to Amsterdam, inaugurated in 1995 and giving the Bluff City huge international cachet, would be converted to a summer-only schedule. Then, in October, the airline dropped the flight from the schedule completely. Similarly, in a Memphis Daily News article of June 2008, Anderson was quoted saying Memphis would be an integral hub of the merged airline: "The consolidation is about addition, not subtraction." The article was one of many from that time noting that, "Anderson said the move could even bring more flights to the city, especially international flights, considering the long list of worldwide cities now served by the two companies." At the time, the cheering section included Memphis Airport Authority chairman Arnold Perl, who was quoted as saying, "The Northwest-Delta merger is great for Memphis, great for the Memphis region, great for Tennessee and great for the United States." To many in Memphis, including those among the 6,000 members of the anti-Delta Facebook group, "Delta Does Memphis," the merger now seems more grating than great. Northwest Airlines flew 240 flights out of Memphis before being acquired by Delta in 2008. In June of this year, Delta announced it would chop 25 flights from Memphis out of its schedule, leaving the hub with 46 percent fewer flights than when the merger took effect. Memphis International Airport chief financial officer Forrest Artz reported that, in September, daily Delta flights were down to 122, compared to 175 the same month a year earlier. For its part, Delta blames other factors beyond the merger for the reduced flights. "Any operational assurance that Delta provided officials was under the understating that any action to the contrary would not be directly related to the merger," Delta spokesman Anthony L. Black said by email. "Specifically, raising fuel costs, the current international economic environment, lack of passenger demand and profitability have been the primary drivers of all network restructuring." While Delta may now claim that any assurances it gave were conditioned by any number of factors, people in Memphis thought they had a deal that meant a strengthened hub and a continued flight to Europe, and maybe more. The facts are the Delta Air Lines CEO said the Memphis-Amsterdam flight would continue. It was first curtailed to summer-only, then chloroformed. That’s a broken promise. Next, the Delta point man said Memphis would remain an integral hub of the new merged airline and might even have "more flights to the city." The number of flights has dropped from 240 to 122, a 49 percent decline. Whatever the circumstances, these qualify as broken promises. Our ruling Memphis Congressman Steve Cohen accuses Delta of breaking promises made to him and the city of Memphis about the impact of its merger with Northwest. Delta has subsequently ended the city’s direct flight to Amsterdam and has cut the number of flights nearly in half. We rule this statement True.

pomt-00953	"There is a very identifiable Somali community" back home in Delaware.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/19/joe-biden/joe-biden-and-his-somali-cab-driver-friends/	In the latest of a series of perceived gaffes that have punctuated his tenure as vice president, Joe Biden set eyerolls rolling when he said he had an extensive friendship with the Somali community in his hometown of Wilmington, Del. At a White House summit on violent extremism on Feb. 17, 2015, Biden said, "Somalis have made my city of Wilmington, Del. (their home) on a smaller scale. There is a very identifiable Somali community. I might add if you come to the train station with me you’ll notice I have great relationships with them because there’s an awful lot driving cabs and are friends of mine. For real. I’m not being solicitous. I’m being serious." In short order, CNN interviewed some Wilmington cab drivers who said they know of drivers from some African countries such as Ghana and Liberia, but none from Somalia. "I don't think I've seen any (Somalis) in Delaware," Anthony Eber, a taxi company owner who emigrated from Sierra Leone, told CNN. Did Biden know something no one else seems to know? Apparently not. The Census Bureau’s latest American Community Survey did find some Delaware residents with Somali ancestry -- it estimated that there were a whopping 15 Somalis in the entire state of Delaware. That’s less than two one-thousandths of 1 percent of the state’s population. If that’s "very identifiable," it would help to have a microscope. Compare that with Minnesota, which has the United States’ largest Somali population, at more than 35,000. Meanwhile, Biden’s home-away-from-home, the Washington, D.C., metro area, ranks in the top five for Somali populations. Refugees from the east African country started coming to the United States en masse in the 1990s, after a civil war broke out. Today, al-Shabaab, an al-Qaida affiliate Islamic terrorist group, is a major source of instability in Somalia and a reason why refugees continue to flee to the United States. All told, roughly 90,000 Somali refugees have resettled in the United States since 2000, according to the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. However, Delaware has not received any of them, according data from the same office. Jewish Family Services of Delaware is the state’s largest refugee resettlement organization. On their website, there’s a list of nearly 40 countries from which refugees have been resettled. About half of those are African countries, but Somalia is not one of them. Wilmington is part of the greater Philadelphia metropolitan area, which has one of the higher rates of foreign-born residents from Africa, according to the American Community Survey. But even in this expanded geographical area, the vast majority are from African countries other than Somalia. Of Delaware’s foreign-born population, only 9.5 percent are from the African continent -- about 8,000 people in all -- and most of those are from West Africa, according to the survey report. And of those 8,000, just 4 percent work in "transportation and warehousing, and utilities," the category that includes taxi drivers. Biden’s office did not respond to a query. His office also didn’t reply by publication time to our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker, which gave Biden their worst rating -- Four Pinocchios -- for this claim. Our ruling Biden said "there is a very identifiable Somali community" back home in Delaware. If so, it's minuscule: The Census Bureau estimates that there’s only 15 Somali people living in Delaware. Biden’s statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2015-02-19T14:39:52	2015-02-17	['None']
pomt-10687	"For every single illegal immigrant family in this country, it costs $20,000 — it costs us $20,000; $20,000 in infrastructural costs. They pay about $10,000 in taxes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/11/tom-tancredo/one-cost-of-illegal-immigration-accuracy/	During an Oct. 9, 2007, debate, Tom Tancredo pressed to change immigration policy by making a dollars and cents argument. Tancredo said an average household with an undocumented worker costs the country more than it pays in taxes. PolitiFact found nothing to disprove Tancredo's statistics, but no one who could verify them — including his campaign. Asked where the statistics originated, Tancredo spokesman Alan Moore referred to the Center for Immigration Studies. Bryan Griffith, a center spokesman, said officials there know of no CIS report with those numbers. However, Griffith pointed to a 2004 report that showed families with undocumented immigrants contributed $4,200 on average to the federal government, but cost Uncle Sam $6,950. That's a long way from the $20,000 in costs and $10,000 in taxes line that Tancredo used. Pressed for more specifics, Tancredo's campaign at first asked for details on the very study it was citing. Weeks later, spokesman Moore pointed to another report. In a 2007 study, Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, found that families with low-skilled immigrants cost taxpayers about $30,130 in 2004. Those households paid about $10,573 in taxes for 2004. But that study includes all low-skilled, immigrant households in America, representing 15.9-million people. About 60 percent were entirely legal households, and 40 percent had undocumented workers. Tancredo's statement is about undocumented workers only, so this study is off point. We found no other recent studies on the overall costs and benefits linked to families of undocumented workers. Moreover, critics point to flaws in the studies showing larger costs than contributions by undocumented workers. Tim Vettel of the American Immigration Law Foundation said he was uncertain where Tancredo's statistics originated but lumped them with other reports that the foundation, which promotes immigration, has criticized. Focusing more broadly on all immigration, the American Immigration Law Foundation said in November 2007 that most studies rely on one-year "snapshots" of the immigrant population without taking into account rising income and future tax contributions. The foundation also said the studies fail to count economic contributions such as consumer purchasing power. The Congressional Research Service reached the same conclusion after reviewing studies in 2005. Its report said information that typically is the basis for cost estimates is not collected, producing estimates based on assumptions and disagreement about accuracy. In the case of illegal immigration, analysts tend to disagree on how many government benefits undocumented workers actually use. "It is very difficult to enumerate a population which is trying to avoid detection by the government," analyst Alison Siskin wrote. Given the lack of information, and dispute over reports we did find, we rule Tancredo's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Tom Tancredo	None	None	None	2007-12-11T00:00:00	2007-10-09	['None']
pomt-06807	"We created a flat tax in the state of Utah."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-he-enacted-flat-tax-utah-governo/	During the Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman touted his record on taxes. When he was governor, he said, Utah had "historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country." This isn’t the first time Huntsman has made that claim. Our PolitiFact team in New Hampshire checked a similar comment Huntsman made at a July 4th, 2011, house party in Belmont, N.H. At that July 4 event, Huntsman said that when he was governor, he worked with the state Legislature to create a flat tax that "cut income taxes by 30 percent." Since Huntsman didn’t repeat the claim that this tax changes had "cut income taxes by 30 percent," we will only rate him now on the question of whether his administration "created a flat tax in the state of Utah." When we first reported this item, the Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports from this spring and from 2007 that explained how Huntsman began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005. "We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens, but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states," Huntsman said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005. Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years. When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent. This created a much flatter tax, stripping away most of the deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bond income or deducting from income the withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts. The research arm of the Utah Legislature says this was not a flat tax in the purest sense. "Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people do.) Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit from state taxes some of what they claim as deductions and tax exemptions under the federal tax code. The credit phases out and goes away from those making very high incomes in the state. This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis. "There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study. Anti-tax groups have given Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax. The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some "minor blemishes"' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.) While we gave Huntsman a Mostly False for his previous statement, most of our downgrade stemmed from our criticism of his claim that his policies "cut income taxes by 30 percent." The system he and the Legislature enacted in Utah wasn’t a pure flat tax, since taxpayers may still make adjustments for certain financial factors. But it is a flatter tax, and it includes one major defining factor of a flat tax -- a single rate for all income groups. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-06688	"We [the city of Atlanta] are overbuilt on housing."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/07/yolanda-adrean/slow-housing-market-poses-problems/	Anyone trying to sell real estate inside Atlanta’s city limits knows the once-red-hot market, with a few exceptions, is pretty chilly. Some experts are so despondent they see the Alpha and the Omega announcing the end of time. Others think we are in a housing slump that will right itself in a few years. There are many explanations for the downturn in the housing market. Atlanta City Councilwoman Yolanda Adrean tossed out one possibility in June when she said on the city’s website: "We are overbuilt on housing." Whoa. Let’s see, the unemployment rate is up and credit is tight, but does the city have too much housing? To the Truth-O-Meter! Adrean said the statement is based on conversations she’s had with friends in the real estate business and articles she’s read in the local media, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. She said she meant that the demand for office as well as residential properties was lower than the inventory. "I would love to be wrong," Adrean told PolitiFact. Bill Adams, president of Adams Realtors, said there are a few specific examples of an oversaturated market within the city. A few neighborhoods in the city, such as Vine City, have been hit hard by foreclosures and as a result have a glut of housing. Likewise, the Buckhead condominium market is clearly overbuilt. But he said that’s not what’s holding back the broader real estate market. "We’re not like a suburban county that had vast acres of housing built," Adams said. "I think mostly it’s a result of buyers sitting on the sidelines." Potential home buyers, many of whom are worried about job security, don’t want to take on additional debt and instead are waiting until the economy stabilizes, he said. Banks, in some cases, have made it tougher to borrow money. All of it creates a critical mass that spells trouble for the Atlanta housing market. Housing sales data collected by Adams show the average sale price for some neighborhoods, such as Inman Park, an upscale neighborhood of tree-lined sidewalks and expensive Victorian housing, are higher than last year. But prices continue to decline in other areas. And last year there was a greater incentive to buy because many people were trying to take advantage of the federal housing tax credit before it expired. SmartNumbers analyst Steve Palm said the city does have an overabundance of depressed housing. The city currently has 6,000 houses for sale under $50,000, Palm said. And in the last year and a half 24,760 houses sold for less than $50,000. "We have a lot of vacant homes," he said. Even so, Palm said the city does not have too many houses on the market. "Our inventory is way down," he said. Some economists speculate that a lot of people are keeping their properties off the market unless they absolutely have to sell them. That also lowers inventory. The current housing inventory is about 40 percent lower than 2007 levels, Palm said. If the number of closings for the metro area -- precise numbers for the city proper are hard to come by -- remained stable and there were no additional houses added to the market, it would take 8.7 months to sell off all the houses in the metro area, he said At the peak of the housing boom it would have taken about 14 months to sell off all available housing in the metro area. This is partly the result of a slowdown in new housing construction, he said. New construction is down 90 percent from the peak years. Bill Murray, the managing broker with Prudential Georgia Realty, agrees there is little new housing and points out that the population of Atlanta is growing, albeit slowly. Census numbers for the city are disputed, but it’s generally agreed the city’s population has increased over the past 10 years. This would suggest the city’s problem is not an oversupply of housing. But Murray said an explosion of foreclosures has helped create an inventory larger than demand. This is why it’s a buyer’s market, he said, so in that sense Adrean has a good point. This was a tough one for the old Truth-O-Meter. Adrean’s statement does not apply to some popular intown neighborhoods and new housing starts are few and far between even as the city’s population continues to inch up, but demand is still low. The councilwoman is not wrong, but she’s not totally right either. Her statement is accurate but leaves out important details. That’s our definition of Half True.

pomt-06010	"When [Mitt Romney] was the governor of Massachusetts, he performed 100 — and I’m not sure this number is right, but my mind says it’s about 180 gay marriages."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/18/judy-manning/lawmaker-says-romney-performed-same-sex-marriages-/	Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has spent a lot of time trying to convince socially conservative voters that he really, really is one of them. Many, including one Georgia lawmaker, still do not think Romney is a true believer in their social and political principles. State Rep. Judy Manning, a Republican from Marietta, recently told The Marietta Daily Journal that she thinks the former Massachusetts governor is a flip-flopper and she is supporting Newt Gingrich, the former Georgia congressman who was speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. We thought one of her comments deserved a spin on the Truth-O-Meter. "When he was the governor of Massachusetts, he performed 100 — and I’m not sure this number is right, but my mind says it’s about 180 gay marriages — and now, when he is running as president on the Republican ticket, he says that marriage is between a man and a woman," Manning said in the article. Did Romney actually perform 100 to 180 gay marriages? Didn’t Romney say in a nationally televised debate earlier this month that while he believes gay couples should have basic legal rights, one right they should not enjoy is marriage? We were curious to find out if Manning was right, particularly since she wasn’t sure about how many marriages Romney may have performed. Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg denied the claim. "That is simply and completely untrue," she said. We called Manning at her legislative office and at her home and sent the representative an email over the span of a week and did not get a reply. Romney was elected governor in 2002 and served from 2003 to 2007. In 2003, the Massachusetts State Judicial Court ruled that same-sex couples have the legal right to marry. Massachusetts has an obscure law that allows family members or friends to perform marriage ceremonies under a one-day marriage designation. The law includes same-sex couples. In 2006, The Boston Globe reported that Romney approved 189 special-issue, one-day marriage designations to same-sex couples in 2005. The article was a look into Romney’s approach on gay marriage as he considered a 2008 presidential run (which he later lost in the GOP primary). A Romney spokesman said in that article that he was bound by the law and had to approve those one-day marriage designations, although he opposed gay marriage. Maggie Gallagher, founder of the National Organization for Marriage, wrote a column in December praising Romney’s support for a federal marriage amendment and his efforts to fight against gay marriage in Massachusetts. The National Organization for Marriage has fought against same-sex marriage on the national and local level. Romney "apparently approved many more, both before and after 2005, but we have not been able to get any records on them," Steve Baldwin, former executive director of the Council for National Policy, said in a column that appeared in the National Review late last month. "There have been Freedom of Information Act requests to get more documents about this whole issue, but the state government has not been forthcoming." Massachusetts officials said their records of one-day marriage designations date back to 2006, not 2005, the year The Boston Globe examined. Massachusetts officials say they do not keep track of how many one-day marriage designations are approved annually for same-sex couples. MassEquality, a Boston-based group organized to preserve same-sex marriage equality, said Romney has not been supportive of gay marriage, and the group seriously doubted that he performed any ceremonies as governor. "The notion that Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, presided over the weddings of same-sex couples is ridiculous," Executive Director Kara Suffredini told us via email. "To the contrary -- and contrary to the promises he made while campaigning for governor -- he did everything he could to position himself as the face of the anti-marriage movement, going so far as to revive an arcane and racist anti-miscegenation law to block out-of-state same-sex couples from marrying in Massachusetts. Make no mistake, former Gov. Romney was no friend to loving same-sex couples and the thousands of children they are raising in Massachusetts." There’s no evidence that Romney has performed any gay marriage ceremonies. It appears Rep. Manning used the wrong language to describe Romney’s actions as governor because her estimate of how many marriages she thought he performed is very similar to the number of one-day marriage designations that The Boston Globe reported. Had Manning said Romney approved 100 to 180 one-day marriage designations, her statement would likely be correct. However, she used the word "performed," which suggests Romney actually officiated the ceremony and created a vastly different impression of the candidate’s stance on same-sex marriage for anyone who read that article.

pomt-04858	Says Barack Obama "has deported more people than any other president in this country's history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/10/american-principles-action/has-barack-obama-deported-more-people-any-other-pr/	A group known as American Principles in Action is running an ad targeting Hispanic voters in Nevada, trying to weaken their support for President Barack Obama. "Don’t be fooled by President Obama’s words," the narrator says. "He’s not committed to immigrants. He only wants our vote. With the election on the line, he offers our undocumented youth a temporary solution that cheats them of legal status. Why didn’t he keep his promise to push immigration reform? Instead, Obama has deported more people than any other president in this country's history. With friends like these, who needs enemies?" The group behind the ad, American Principles in Action is an affiliate of the American Principles Project, a group founded by conservative scholar Robert George of Princeton University. The group’s staff member responsible for Latino issues is Alfonso Aguilar, the former chief of the U.S. Office of Citizenship under President George W. Bush. But while the group is independent of the campaign, the ad’s message helps Romney. Nevada is a key battleground state that Obama won in 2008 and which he’s eager to win again. Latinos are a significant voting bloc there and in other swing states that Obama won in 2008, such as Colorado and New Mexico. Polls this year have shown that Latinos heavily support Obama over Mitt Romney, in part because Romney took a tough line against illegal immigration during the GOP primaries. So Obama’s critics would like to shrink his lead among Latino voters, particularly in key states, either by bringing them over to Romney’s side or at least by making them less enthusiastic about Obama. The ad first dismisses Obama’s proposal in June to temporarily halt deportations of young people, saying it "cheats them of legal status." It then says Obama "has deported more people than any other president in this country's history." Given the rhetoric that sometimes criticizes Obama for being weak on illegal immigration, we wondered if that was true. We found it was, for the most part. According to current figures from Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- the federal agency responsible for deportations -- Obama has removed 1.4 million people during his 42 months in office so far. Technically, that's fewer than under George W. Bush, whose cumulative total was 2 million. But Bush’s number covers eight full years, which doesn’t allow an apples-to-apples comparison. If you instead compare the two presidents’ monthly averages, it works out to 32,886 for Obama and 20,964 for Bush, putting Obama clearly in the lead. Bill Clinton is far behind with 869,676 total and 9,059 per month. All previous occupants of the White House going back to 1892 fell well short of the level of the three most recent presidents. We wondered whether there might have been a surge of undocumented immigrants that explained the increase, but there wasn’t. During the first two years of Obama’s tenure, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated the illegal immigrant population nationwide at 11.2 million, compared to an average during Bush’s eight-year tenure of 10.6 million. And illegal immigration actually peaked late in Bush’s second term, at which point the recession hit and the numbers declined under Obama. Such patterns do not explain the 57 percent bump in monthly deportations that we found under Obama. We should also note that if Obama doesn't win a second term, he will almost certainly finish his term trailing George W. Bush in deportations, which would make inaccurate the claim that Obama has "deported more people than any other president in this country's history." Still, the ad has a point in noting a significant uptick in deportations under Obama. We asked five immigration specialists -- Columbia University historian Mae M. Ngai, University of Albany historian Carl Bon Tempo, Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian, University of California (Davis) law school dean Kevin R. Johnson and University of San Francisco law professor Bill Hing -- whether they thought the ad’s numerical claim was basically accurate, and they all agreed. Bon Tempo cautioned that some variations in data quality make long-term comparisons somewhat dicey. Still, he added that "it does seem that deportations are on the rise, and markedly so." Boosting the number of deportations in recent years are a program dating to the Bush years that targets "fugitive" aliens, as well as a program known as Secure Communities, under which federal immigration authorities are kept apprised of people who are fingerprinted at the state and local level. Hing, a critic of the program, says it has "gone way too far, sweeping up many crime victims, witnesses, arrestees whose charges are later dropped, and minor offenders." The American Civil Liberties Union has gone even further, with legislative counsel Joanne Lin saying that Obama’s enforcement policies overall have left a "wake of devastation in Latino communities across the nation," according to the Los Angeles Times. Obama has not been shy about touting his immigration-enforcement credentials, though he’s usually careful to say he’s prioritizing resources by focusing on deporting criminals rather than law-abiding people. For instance, during the speech in which he offered the youth non-deportation proposal, Obama said, "In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we’ve tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places. … We focused and used discretion about whom to prosecute, focusing on criminals who endanger our communities rather than students who are earning their education. And today, deportation of criminals is up 80 percent. We've improved on that discretion carefully and thoughtfully." Ngai, the Columbia historian, perceives Obama’s tough enforcement policy as a tactical move. "My interpretation is that the Obama administration decided to be tough on ‘criminal’ aliens in order to get support for legalization of undocumented immigrants with no criminal record," Ngai said. Of course, Romney is widely considered to be taking a harder line on illegal immigration than Obama. According to his website’s statement on immigration policy, Romney opposes both "amnesty" and "all ‘magnets’ that entice illegal immigrants to come to our country. As governor, he vetoed in-state tuition benefits for illegal immigrants and opposed driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants." Our ruling Technically, the ad isn’t correct to say that Barack Obama "has deported more people than any other president in this country's history," since George W. Bush cumulatively deported more over his full eight-year term -- and since Bush would remain ahead of Obama if Mitt Romney wins the presidency in November. However, we -- and the experts we interviewed -- agree that the ad is right to note a significant jump in deportations under Obama. Measured by the monthly frequency of deportation, Obama’s numbers are significantly higher than Bush’s were, even as the estimated population of illegal immigrants was falling.

pomt-08329	Says Peter Kilmartin has "only three years experience in his own law practice."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/29/christopher-little/g-candidate-little-says-kilmartin-has-only-three-y/	Christopher Little, the Moderate Party's candidate for attorney general, has been attacking the qualifications of his Democratic opponent, Peter Kilmartin, by saying he has meager experience as a lawyer. "Only the insider candidate could have a hope of being attorney general with only three years experience in his own law practice. But that's what Kilmartin has," Little says in a television ad as it displays the words "Started private practice in 2007." After the Kilmartin campaign issued a news release labeling Little's accusation "completely false," we decided to see if the Truth-O-Meter would agree. Kilmartin's campaign says he has been a practicing lawyer since 1999, when he was admitted to the Rhode Island Bar. And Kilmartin has been touting his additional experience working as the officer in charge of the Pawtucket police prosecution bureau from 2001-2004. Kilmartin spokesman Brett Broesder sent us a copy of a Citizens Bank statement showing that Kilmartin opened up a business account prior to May 1, 1999; the address lists a law office at 393 Armistice Blvd, Pawtucket, where his name is on the sign beneath the names of three other attorneys. When asked for evidence of an early case that Kilmartin handled as a practicing attorney, Broesder sent along a District Court eviction notice for nonpayment of $425 in rent, listing Kilmartin as the landlord's lawyer. The date: July 14, 1999. Of course, one eviction notice does not a legal career make, so we asked for more, especially after we were unable to find Kilmartin's name listed in the "lawyers" section of any edition of the Verizon Yellow Pages from 2001-2005. In response, the campaign supplied us with copies of Kilmartin's Schedule C forms from his 1999-2005 tax returns. Schedule C is for reporting business profits and expenses. His business is listed as "legal services" and gives a new address of 598 Armistice Blvd., which is Kilmartin's residence. But the dollar amounts are blacked out, so we have no idea of the scope of his business, how many clients he has had over the years, or whether the blacked out figures were profits or losses. We asked his campaign to at least tell us his minimum or maximum income for any of those years. His spokesman declined. So it appears that although Kilmartin wasn't actively advertising his services to the general public (at least through the phone book), Kilmartin was doing at least some private practice work eight years earlier than Little's ad asserts. The Little campaign responded to our query by sending information showing that Kilmartin retired from the police department in 2007. Spokesman Robert LaChance asserted that between his police job and his work as a state representative in the General Assembly, Kilmartin could not have been an "active" lawyer until 2007 because he had other responsibilities. LaChance said the "active practice" designation is important, citing R.I. Supreme Court rules that say an out-of-state attorney is allowed to skip part of the Rhode Island Bar Association examination only if he or she has been in full-time practice for at least five years. But that rule doesn't apply to Kilmartin, who has had the right to practice in Rhode Island for more than a decade. LaChance said that "As far as what most lawyers would consider legal experience, [Kilmartin] has only been doing that for three years" when he retired from the police department. Maybe so. But Little's claim in his commercial makes no distinction between being a full-time ("active") or part-time lawyer. It says he has "only three years experience in his own law practice." Kilmartin's tax forms, showing that he was doing some degree of legal work -- as limited as it might be -- well before 2007 shows otherwise. The Truth-O-Meter rules that Little's claim is False.

pomt-10873	An estimated 56 million Americans don't have bank accounts.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/23/john-edwards/correct-but-he-uses-the-most-sensational-estimate/	There's more than one source on these bank account figures and all of them are estimates. But no matter the details, the point Edwards seeks to make is the same: Because they lack bank accounts, millions of poor must rely on expensive check-cashing services and payday loans. The Edwards campaign Website uses the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank for its figure of about 56 million people without accounts. The center got the number from a 2002 report by the General Accounting Office, which used U.S. Census data to estimate that 55.9-million adults did not hold checking, savings or money market accounts in 1999. But that number is at the high end of the available estimates. According to the Federal Reserve Board's 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, its most recent, the number of American families without a bank account is closer to 10-million. The Census estimates 2.6 individuals per houshold, which would put the Federal Reserve estimate on bank accounts at 26-million at the very most because the Census household figure includes children.

pomt-13125	Says Donald Trump and Ron Johnson "oppose a woman's right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/03/russ-feingold/russ-feingolds-attack-donald-trump-and-ron-johnson/	The tight Wisconsin U.S. Senate race has been marked by attacks made on GOP incumbent Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Russ Feingold. (We’ve highlighted 20 of them.) But ahead of the Nov. 8, 2016 election, Johnson and his fellow Republicans are also trying to tie Feingold to the unpopular Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. And Feingold and other Democrats are trying to hitch Johnson to the equally unpopular GOP nominee, Donald Trump. A Feingold radio ad released Oct. 26, 2016 makes a number of claims about Johnson and Trump on women’s issues, including saying they both "oppose a woman's right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act, denying protections to victims of domestic violence." Let’s check both parts of the attack. Right to choose On abortion generally, Trump has been controversial. In Green Bay in March 2016, he said women should be punished for having an abortion. (Our In Context item fleshed out those remarks.) Then, hours later, Trump’s campaign posted a statement saying women are victims of abortion. When it comes more specifically to a woman’s right to choose, Trump went from pro-choice to anti-abortion, as our colleagues noted in rating True a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina that Trump had "changed his mind" on abortion. As late as 2000, Trump wrote that he was pro-choice. But by 2011, he said he was anti-abortion, a position he has stated as recently as October 2016. Trump has said, including in his Green Bay remarks, that he supports exceptions for the life of the mother, incest and rape. Johnson is also anti-abortion. During his successful campaign to win Feingold’s seat in 2010, Johnson was asked if he Roe v. Wade was "settled law." He said the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion "was a real tragedy," saying it "usurped the democratic process." In this race, Johnson was endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life, which noted his support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a 2015 bill that would have generally banned abortion at 20 weeks and later. And Life News has urged support for Johnson, saying he has a "strong pro-life voting record." Feingold’s campaign also pointed out that in 2011, Johnson co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, which declared "that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being beginning at the moment of fertilization, cloning, and other moment at which an individual comes into being." Johnson, however, has supported the three exceptions -- a position that drew some criticism from conservatives when he challenged Feingold in 2010. Violence Against Women Act The Violence Against Women Act was adopted in 1994. When it was reauthorized in 2005, it was set to expire in 2011. New reauthorization votes were taken in 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Johnson was among 31 Republican senators who voted no. The bill passed the Senate, but died in the House. In 2013, the bill passed the Senate again, with Johnson among 22 Senate Republicans to vote no. The measure then passed the House and was signed into law. Like the 1994 version, the renewed law makes it easier to prosecute crimes against women in federal court, and provides such services as domestic abuse hotlines and shelters for battered women. The new bill was also extended to women of Native American tribal lands who are attacked by non-tribal residents, as well as to immigrants, gays and lesbians. It’s worth noting why Johnson said he voted no. Johnson issued a statement after his 2012 vote, saying in part: I believe it’s critical to ensure that laws are in place to prevent and deter crime – against both women and men. Regrettably, the debate over the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act was completely politicized by the Senate Democratic leadership. Republicans offered very reasonable alternatives to extend the Violence Against Women Act. Senate Democrats today defeated proposals to provide U.S. marshals the tools they need to track sex offenders across state lines. They voted against legislation to establish an interstate database for DNA evidence, to ensure sex offenders are brought to justice regardless or the jurisdiction in which they commit their crimes. And they rejected legislation to provide additional funds to allow law enforcement to pursue justice for hundreds of thousands of women. Johnson also issued a statement following his 2013 vote, saying in part: In passing the Violence Against Women Act, the Democrat-controlled Senate turned the renewal of a non-controversial piece of legislation that had a history of strong bipartisan support into a divisive and highly partisan bill. As a result, the Senate has approved a piece of legislation that sounds nice, but which is fatally flawed. By including an unconstitutional expansion of tribal authority and introducing a bill before the Congressional Budget Office could review it to estimate its cost, Senate Democrats made it impossible for me to support a bill covering an issue I would like to address. Most analysts believe it would add more than $2 billion to the deficit. I voted for an alternative that did not have these serious flaws. That alternative would help deter and prosecute violence against women – without the inclusion of unconstitutional provisions. Our rating Feingold says Trump and Johnson "oppose a woman’s right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act." Trump and Johnson are anti-abortion, though Trump in particular has said he supports exceptions to allow abortion in certain cases. Johnson did vote no on reauthorizing the violence law, but it’s not as though he opposed protections for women; in fact, he voted for alternative measures that did not pass. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9098398a-5eba-4691-8b05-25a5f5b6640a	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-11-03T06:00:00	2016-10-26	['None']
pomt-00071	On Abigail Spanberger: "She got $2.2 million from ActBlue...That is the George Soros resistance group."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2018/nov/02/dave-brat/dave-brats-linkage-george-soros-abigail-spanberger/	The spectre of George Soros - a billionaire philanthropist who supports liberal causes and is the focus of many conspiracy theorists - has entered the 7th District congressional race. Dave Brat, the Republican incumbent, is saying on conservative radio shows that Soros is behind the hefty fundraising of Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic challenger. Spanberger had raised $4.5 million through Sept. 25, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commision. That was nearly double the $2.3 million raised by Brat - or a $2.2 million difference. Brat says Soros organizations are responsible for the difference. "She got $2.2 million from ActBlue," Brat said during an Oct. 21 interview on Breitbart News Sunday. "Your audience probably knows who they are, right? But that is the George Soros resistance group. That’s not even mainstream Democrat. That’s the group that’s doing the riots in Portland, that’s promoting violence and mobs instead of jobs." "...Abigail Spanberger is getting $2.2 million from the Soros-linked resist movement - ActBlue," Brat said during an Oct. 22 interview on the John Frederick Show in Portsmouth. "She raised $3 million in the last three months, which is unheard of, from (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi and ActBlue, which is a George Soros-backed group," Brat said during an Oct. 16 interview on News Radio WRVA in Richmond. "It’s her largest bundler which raises money, and that is the group that is behind the resistance movement across the United States." Soros has been high in the news lately. Some conservatives - including religious broadcaster Pat Roberston of Virginia Beach - have accused Soros of funding the migrant caravan from the Honduras to the United States - a charge the billionaire says is false and for which no supporting evidence has emerged. And on Oct. 22, a pipe bomb was found in the mailbox of Soros’ home near New York City - one of at least 14 explosives that had been mailed in late October to critics of President Donald Trump. We wondered whether Brat is right in claiming Spanberger’s campaign has received $2.2 million from a Soros-controlled group called ActBlue. Let’s take a look. What is ActBlue? ActBlue is a nonprofit organization that provides a software platform for people to contribute to Democratic campaigns through personal computers and cell phones. If you donate to a Democratic candidate on his or her website, there’s a good chance that ActBlue is the conduit that sends your money to the campaign - much like PayPal is the conduit for many online purchases. Since its inception in 2005, ActBlue says it has funneled $3 billion to Democratic candidates and "progressive" causes. Spanberger uses ActBlue, and has received several thousand individual contributions through the platform. They totaled almost $2.2 million through Sept. 25, which was the most current FEC reporting date available when Brat made his statements. Soros is among millions of people who have made contributions through ActBlue, according to Chris Fleming, spokesman for the nonprofit. "Soros has given through ActBlue, not to ActBlue," Fleming said. "Anyone can give through ActBlue." Fleming declined give the sum of Soros' donations to candidates through ActBlue. But he emphasized that Soros does not financially support ActBlue nor play a role in its operations. "ActBlue is in no way related to George Soros," he said. Soros has not personally given money to Spanberger’s campaign or to any Democrat running for Congress during this two-year election cycle, according to FEC records. Brat’s explanation We asked Brat’s campaign for proof of the candidate’s claim that ActBlue "is the George Soros resistance group." Katey Price, Brat’s campaign spokesperson, sent an article from USA Today and blogs from two conservative websites: Human Events and The Daily Signal. On March 20, 2017, USA Today ran a story headlined, "George Soros-aligned group weighs funding anti-Trump activists." The article reported that Indivisible - a group seeking to build "resistance" to President Donald Trump’s agenda - was seeking support (successfully, it turns out) from the Democracy Alliance, an activist organization Soros helped found in 2005 that raises money through ActBlue. The Daily Signal - on Feb. 10, 2017 - reported that one member of Indivisible’s board of directors had previously worked for a Soros-funded group, and another member is now employed by an organization that has received money from the billionaire. That shows, according to the blog, that Soros has "loose ties" to Indivisible. ActBlue, the blog says "raises money" for Indivisible. Human Events - on July 7, 2009 - called ActBlue a mouthpiece "for the radical agendas of the likes of Soros and labor." As proof, it wrote that "Soros directly donated $6,900 to ActBlue on May 11, 2008." Fleming said this is wrong; Soros contributed the sum "through" ActBlue to Scott Kleeb, a Nebraska Democrat who was running for the U.S. Senate. Our ruling Brat says of Spanberger, "She got $2.2 million for ActBlue...That is the George Soros resistance group." Brat is implausibly positioning Soros, the focus of many conservative theorists, as the power behind Spanberger’s campaign. ActBlue is not a Soros-controlled organization. It’s a nonprofit group that provides a software platform that allows people to contribute to Democratic candidates and causes through their personal computers and cell phones.

pomt-12308	A waiver in the American Health Care Act "doesn’t apply to things like maternity coverage."	false	/new-york/statements/2017/jun/22/john-faso/maternity-care-coverage-could-be-lost-through-stat/	The U.S. Senate health care bill would allow states to waive federal requirements for what insurance plans must cover. With state waivers, insurers could skip coverage of what the current Affordable Care Act now requires to be covered, known as essential health benefits like prescription drugs, laboratory services and hospitalization. Health insurance companies in those states would be able to sell lower-priced plans with less coverage. The House included the same provision in its Obamacare replacement bill, the American Health Care Act. Rep. John Faso, a Hudson Valley Republican, defended the provision in a radio town hall before the Senate version was released. "I read this provision extremely closely, and I don’t believe many, if any, governors will actually seek these waivers. It’s an extraordinarily limited waiver," Faso said. "It doesn’t apply to things like maternity coverage." A spokesperson from Faso’s office said he was talking about how coverage for maternity care would still be required in New York state even if the state sought a waiver. Iinsurers are required to cover maternity care under New York state law, a distinction Faso did not make in his claim. Is Faso right that the new waivers would not apply to coverage for maternity care? Law on maternity care coverage Maternity care is included in one of ten health care categories insurance plans have to cover under federal law. Those categories, the essential health benefits, were established in 2010 as part of Obamacare. The benefits only apply to individual and group plans with 100 or fewer members, known as small group plans in New York state. Most states define small group plans as those with 50 or fewer members. The House and Senate bills would allow states to waive the essential health benefits requirement. Insurers in those states would not have to cover any benefit not mandated by that state’s law. "The waiver that was included in the American Health Care Act allows states to redefine essential health benefits as it applies to individual and small market groups in their state," said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow in the Center of Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization. "Maternity coverage is one thing that’s considered an essential health benefit today so a state could eliminate maternity care coverage in their state," Fiedler said. Maternity coverage was not federally mandated before Obamacare. Only 18 states required it in small group and individual plans prior to the 2010 health care law according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization. Large group plans, those with more than 100 members in New York state, have been required to cover maternity care since the federal 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Will could happen? The Congressional Budget Office, a federal agency that provides nonpartisan fiscal analyses for Congress, predicted maternity care coverage would be lost in states that seek a waiver. "Services or benefits likely to be excluded from the EHBs in some states include maternity care, mental health and substance abuse benefits, rehabilitative and habilitative services, and pediatric dental benefits," the agency said in a report on the American Health Care Act. "If a state only waives the requirement that plans offer maternity coverage, then it’s unlikely any plan would voluntarily offer maternity coverage," said Cynthia Cox, associate director for health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation. The CBO said maternity care may be offered by insurers in those states as a rider, or addition, to a plan. But that would not come cheap. "Without maternity coverage, new moms could expect to pay about $17,000 out-of-pocket," Cox said. "Or, if they tried to buy a rider, they could expect to pay more than $1,000 per month." Congress included $15 billion in the American Health Care Act for maternity care, mental health care, and substance use treatment. The CBO predicts that money will go to health care providers to reduce costs for patients instead of insurers. Our ruling Faso said a waiver in the American Health Care Act "doesn’t apply to things like maternity coverage." The waiver applies specifically to maternity coverage. If a state does not require maternity coverage and is approved for a waiver, insurers there would not be required to cover maternity care. We rate his claim False.

pomt-00794	Says Hillary Clinton will receive her "congressional salary until she dies" and the Secret Service pays her mortgage.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/06/chain-email/chain-email-secret-service-pays-clintons-mortgage/	Now that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is nearing the launch of her 2016 presidential campaign, old rumors are starting to resurface. A reader forwarded us a chain email he received that calls out Clinton and former President Bill Clinton for shady financial decisions. Versions of this same email first circulated in 2001 and again in 2008, during Hillary Clinton’s first presidential run. And now it’s back. The email reads, in part: Hillary Rodham Clinton, as a New York State Senator now comes under this fancy "congressional retirement staffing plan" which means that if she never gets re-elected, she STILL receives her Congressional salary until she dies. If Bill out-lives her, he then inherits HER salary until he dies. He is already getting his Presidential salary ($20,000 a month) until he dies. If Hillary out-lives Bill, she also gets HIS salary until she dies, Guess who pays for that? WE DO! Clinton's 20 Acre - $11 million mansion is common knowledge. For her to establish NY residency, they purchased this mansion in upscale Chappaqua, New York....makes sense. They are entitled to Secret Service protection for life. Still makes sense. Here is where it becomes interesting. Their mortgage payments are around $10,000/month. But an extra residence had to be built by the government on the acreage to house the Secret Service Agents. Any improvement to the property is owned by the property owners...the Clinton's. So....the Clinton's charge the federal government $10,000 monthly rent for the use of the extra residence to house the Secret Service staff which is just about equal to their mortgage payment. There’s a lot to unravel here. Is any of it true? Short answer: No. Pensions First, let’s look at whether Clinton will receive her congressional salary until she dies. Upon retiring, Clinton would receive benefits through the Federal Employee Retirement System, which would also cover her time as secretary of state. However, the pension for a member of Congress must not exceed 80 percent of the member’s final salary, according to law. So even if she received the highest pension possible, she wouldn’t be getting her full salary. In fact, in Clinton’s case, it would be much lower. Pension annuities for federal employees are calculated using length of career, a benefits accrual rate and an average of the employees’ highest three salaries. Clinton spent eight years in the Senate and about four years as secretary of state, where she made her highest salary of about $186,000. Her accrual rate would be 1.7 percent. We did the calculation, based on the formulas in a Congressional Research Service report, and found that she would actually earn a pension of about $41,000 -- about 25 percent of her salary as a senator. And would Bill Clinton get that pension if he outlives Hillary? No -- according to the federal Office of Personnel Management, he could receive a maximum of 50 percent of her pension. As for Bill Clinton’s presidential pension, he receives about $220,000 a year, which is about 75 percent of his presidential salary, after adjusting for inflation. Taxpayer-funded mortgage? The email also implies that tax dollars are paying for the Clintons’ mortgage at their house in Chappaqua, N.Y. As it turns out, this was one of the very first claims PolitiFact ever fact-checked back in 2007. We rated it False, but let’s run through it quickly one more time. As all former presidents, Bill Clinton is entitled to Secret Service detail for the rest of his life, including protection at his home. According to a Secret Service spokesman quoted in a 2001 Washington Post article, it is customary for the government to pay rent to the property owners in a situation like this. However, the Clintons declined that rent. Former White House Press Secretary Jake Siewert told the Washington Post that "the Clintons are entitled to collect rent from the agency for space at their Chappaqua, N.Y., home but have declined the payments of about $1,100 a month." When we looked at this in 2007, Hillary Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said, "They have not and do not receive money" from the Secret Service. This time around, we asked current spokesman Nick Merrill, who said, "this is the same as it used to be, nothing has changed since last time you reported this." We should point out that the Clintons purchased their Chappaqua house in 1999 for $1.7 million, not $11 million as the email says. They also purchased it on a certain type of mortgage that required they pay back the entire amount within five years with monthly mortgage payments of about $8,000, according to the New York Times. Even if the Clintons got the $1,100 rent from the Secret Service, it would not have covered the size of their monthly mortgage. This is not to say the Clintons aren’t wealthy -- and they still receive a good amount of money from the government because of Bill Clinton’s presidency. But the claims in this email are in no way accurate. Our ruling A chain email said Hillary Clinton will receive her "congressional salary until she dies" and that the Secret Service pays her mortgage. Actually, a pension for a member of Congress cannot exceed 80 percent of the member’s last salary, according to law. Using federal employee retirement system formulas, Clinton’s retirement pension would likely work out to be about 25 percent of her congressional salary, about $41,000 a year. And while the Clintons are eligible to receive rent payments from the Secret Service -- who need space to operate at the Clintons’ house -- the rent amount would not have covered their mortgage payments. In any case, the Clintons do not accept these rent payments. We rate these claims Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2015-04-06T15:30:00	2015-04-06	['None']
pomt-14101	"Austin is number one in Texas in startups, venture capital and patents."	true	/texas/statements/2016/may/13/steve-adler/steve-adler-correctly-says-austin-no-1-texas-start/	Austin’s typically soft-spoken mayor recently popped a big-as-Texas boast. "There’s a reason Austin is number one in Texas in startups and venture capital and patents," Steve Adler said. Adler, speaking outside City Hall, went on: "There’s a reason that tech and transportation companies come to Austin to roll out their new initiatives. And that’s because Austin is where good ideas become real. Claiming that Austin is anti-innovation has no basis in fact." Hear hear! Still, we wondered about the rankings Adler declared while revealing his plans to vote against a ballot proposition, later rejected by voters, affecting background checks of drivers for ride-hailing services. Startups Adler's office didn't immediately offer his backup. Meantime, our online search for information on startups led us to a June 2015 report from the Kansas City-based Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation stating that in the "last year," the Austin metropolitan area ranked No. 1 nationally for the area’s pace launching startups, which the foundation defined as "firms less than one-year old employing at least one person besides the owner." Asked what "last year" means in the report, foundation researcher E.J. Reedy advised by phone the conclusion tied to data from 2012 and 2014. According to the foundation, which says it focuses on improving lives through education and entrepreneurship, the nation’s top 10 metropolitan areas for "startup activity" among the 40 most-populous metropolitan areas were: Austin; Miami, Fla.; San Jose, Calif.; Los Angeles; Denver; San Francisco; New York; Houston; San Diego; and San Antonio." Per Adler’s Texas point, the Austin area had 180.8 startups per 100,000 residents, the foundation says, outpacing the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area (142.5 startups per 100,000 residents), Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown (136.9 startups per 100,000 residents) and the San Antonio-New Braunfels area (111.9 startups per 100,000 residents). By email, foundation spokeswoman Lacey Graverson told us the presented concentrations drew on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics to tally startups matched with population data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Reedy agreed by phone that among the big Texas cities, the Austin area had the greatest concentration of startups. But generally, Reedy indicated, counts of startups can vary, partly because there’s no single accepted definition of startups, which inherently come and go at a rapid pace. The government has official measures, Reedy added, but each one captures an aspect -- for instance new employer businesses or newly self-employed individuals. Also, Reedy said, observers differ over what merits counting. Some stress large firms that employ many, he said, others urge a fix on technology firms and others say that any count should recognize small businesses (including one-person endeavors) that grow by an employee or two a year. A foundation chart presenting Austin’s "startup density" since the late 1970s indicates the area has had peppier times--including in 2008 (201.7 startups per 100,000 residents), 2006 (214.9), 1999 (217.9) and, the chart’s high point, 1981 (499.5), which was up a huge measure from 1980 (31.4): SOURCE: Web page, "Startup Activity, Austin Area, 2015," Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, June 4, 2015 (viewed May 5, 2016) Venture capital Next, we turned to exploring Austin’s ranking for venture capital, which describes money invested in a business or project at considerable risk. A January 2016 Austin American-Statesman news story, citing a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, said Austin entities in 2015 were "by far" the state’s largest recipients of venture capital, with $740 million; Dallas firms placed second, fielding $214.4 million, ahead of Houston outfits, at $160 million. The Austin-connected investments added up to the largest annual dollar figure for Austin since 2001, the newspaper said, when 127 companies received $1.14 billion. By email, mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford pointed out another account of the survey results; a Silicon Hills News story said the 99 Austin deals in 2015, mostly to develop software, were down from 114 in 2014. Also, the story said, Austin’s number one deal for the latest year was Civitas Learning, attracting $60 million in venture capital, followed by Aeglea Biotherapeautics with $44 million, Mirna Therapeutics with $41.8 million and SpareFoot with $30 million, the story said. Nationally in 2015, the Statesman story said, venture capital investments rose to $58.8 billion, up 22 percent from the year before. Silicon Valley, as usual, took in the most money, with the San Jose area receiving $27.3 billion in 1,333 deals, the story said. Patents Stanford said Adler made his claim about Austin leading Texas in patents based on a May 2010 Forbes.com article by Andy Greenberg stating that Austin and neighboring Round Rock had "produced an impressive average 1.7 patents for every thousand residents over the last 12 months," the second-most per-capita of any metro area in the country, he wrote. Greenberg elaborated: "Austin’s culture of innovation may be boosted by well-known tech credentials like the South by Southwest (SXSW) Web startup and music festival held annually in March, as well as the nearby headquarters of hardware industry giants Dell and Freescale Semiconductor. But they also have two secret weapons in the innovation race: the University of Texas’s Cockrell School of Engineering, and IBM’s Austin research lab. "IBM produces more patents than any other company in the world, and for the last seven years Austin has produced more of those patents than any other IBM office. In total the lab produced 880 patents in 2009. That’s just 30 less than all of Cisco, and 300 more than Sun Microsystems, Boeing, AT&T or Toyota." We were unable to confirm or duplicate Greenberg’s Austin conclusion. To get our own sense of how Texas cities stand in patents originated, we reached out to the Dallas-based regional office of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. By email, spokesman Ryan Elliott pointed out patent counts posted by the office indicating that in 2012-13 and from 2000 through 2013, the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area generated more patents than the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area. However, the regions’ raw counts were close, according to the agency, while the Austin area was responsible for more patents than any other Texas area from 2009, 2010 and 2011 through 2013, by our reckoning. Snapshot: The Austin area was responsible for 12,387 patents from 2009 through 2013, according to the office, with the Dallas area accounting for 11,546 patents -- which we took to mean that the less populous Austin area ran well ahead of the Dallas area in patents per 1,000 residents. Our search for relevant analyses led to a 2013 report by the Brookings Institution finding that from 1980 to 2012, most U.S. patents--63 percent--had been developed by people living in just 20 metro areas home to 34 percent of the U.S. population. "Reflecting the advantages of large metropolitan economies," the report said, "92 percent of U.S. patents are concentrated in just 100 metro areas, with 59 percent of the population. For patents applied for from 2007 to 2011, the metro areas with the highest number per capita are San Jose; Burlington, VT; Rochester, MN; Corvallis, OR; and Boulder, CO." The authors wrote: "From 1980 to 2011, a few large metros notably changed their share of U.S patents. At the top, San Jose moved up from ninth to first, and San Francisco moved from seventh to fourth, moving ahead of Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Boston. Seattle and San Diego moved up 15 and nine places, respectively, to become seventh and eighth. Meanwhile, Austin and Raleigh moved up 41 and 55 places, respectively, to become 11th and 20th. Cleveland fell 10 slots from 13th to 23rd, while Philadelphia fell from fourth to 13th." Not only did Austin surge in total patents, it lately achieved a high ranking in per-capita patents. From 2007 through 2011, a chart in the report indicates, the Austin metro area had 1,503 patents per million residents, tops in Texas and placing the area fourth nationally among high-patent areas behind San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, California (5,066 patents per million residents); Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown, New York (1,829); and San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont (1,638). In Texas, the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown metro area had 379 patents per million residents and the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area had 310 per million, according to Brookings. Next, we heard back from Mark Muro of Brookings who shared a chart that he said was based on a different data source -- global PCT patents, meaning the international patent system rather than the U.S. PTO. By that metric, the chart suggests that from 2008 through 2012, the Houston metropolitan area generated more cutting-edge "technology" patents per 1,000 residents (1,598) than the Austin area (1,294). An excerpt: SOURCE: Chart ranking 100 U.S. Core Based Statistical Areas in tech patents invented per 1,000 population, 2008-2012 (received by email from Mark Muro, senior fellow and policy director, Metropolitan Policy Program, Brookings, May 5, 2016) Regardless of those results, Muro and a Brookings colleague, Nick Marchio, suggested we hew to the U.S. patent office counts as the best general way of assessing the mayor’s claim. Marchio even volunteered to adjust the patent office’s raw counts for the population of each metropolitan area. Result: In 2013, the latest year of tabulated patents, the Austin area ranked No. 11 nationally with 1.55 patents per 1,000 residents, far outpacing the No. 2 Texas metro, Dallas, at 51st with 0.44 patents per 1,000 residents. Also, from 2009 through 2013, the Austin area ranked 10th nationally with 6.95 patents per 1,000 residents, far ahead of the No. 2 Texas metro, in this case the Houston area, which landed 52nd nationally with 1.81 patents per 1,000 residents. Our ruling Adler said: "Austin is number one in Texas in startups, venture capital and patents." Houston has been running ahead in international technology patents, it looks to us, but Austin lately leads the state in overall patents, startups and venture capital. We rate the claim True.

pomt-09624	“Illegal immigrants currently occupy 8 million jobs.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/lamar-smith/rep-lamar-smith-says-immigrants-hold-8-million-job/	In response to a new Democratic proposal to overhaul immigration laws, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith noted that a large number of illegal immigrants have jobs in the United States and suggested that one way to reduce the unemployment rate would be to free up those jobs for citizens and legal immigrants. Smith, R-San Antonio, said the illegal immigrants hold 8 million jobs, according to a news release distributed Dec. 15. Arguing against the Democrats’ proposal to provide millions of immigrants a path to citizenship, Smith says U.S. policies should “put American workers, American taxpayers, and American citizens first, not those who are in the country illegally. This is the kind of legislation that foreign governments would promote, not the U.S. Congress.” He added that “allowing millions of illegal immigrants to stay and take jobs away from citizens and legal immigrants is like giving a burglar a key to the house. Illegal immigrants currently occupy 8 million jobs. Those stolen jobs rightfully belong to citizens and legal immigrants.” Leaving aside the question of whether any of those jobs were "stolen" from their rightful owners, we wondered whether Smith's 8 million figure — about the same as the population of Virginia — was correct. Do illegal immigrants hold that many jobs? Smith’s source for the number is a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, Jeffrey Passel, who analyzed the relevant data for an April 2009 report, “A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States.” The Pew center is a research organization that seeks to “improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population.” Using March 2008 data, primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau, Passel estimated that the number of undocumented workers in the United States was 7.8 million, so Smith is clearly in the ballpark. But is it fair of the congressman to make his statement about jobs when the data refers to workers? Passel said yes. We found a wrinkle, though. Economic conditions have changed since March 2008. Smith’s statement suggests that the 8 million is a current figure, but the data used for that estimate are more than 20 months old. Since then, millions of people have lost their jobs, including many undocumented immigrants. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national unemployment rate for March 2008 was 5.1 percent; that figure has skyrocketed, to 10 percent, in December 2009. That month, more than 15 million people were without jobs. Immigrants have been hit harder in the economic downturn. The unemployment rate for immigrants, without regard to their citizenship status, has gone up faster than that of natives, Passel said. With huge job losses across all demographic groups, Passel said the number of employed illegal immigrants has most likely dropped. Passel suggested that today the number is closer to 7 million. So Smith is right that millions of jobs are held by illegal immigrants. Yet by citing numbers that were 20 months old, he didn't account for conditions that have caused some of those jobs to disappear. We find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-05167	Says President Barack Obama wants to raise "the lowest (income) tax rate from 10 to 15 percent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/17/reince-priebus/gop-leader-reince-priebus-says-obama-wants-raise-l/	When Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus talked with Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren on June 5, 2012, it was primarily to discuss Gov. Scott Walker’s victory that night in the historic Wisconsin recall election. But Priebus, the former head of the Wisconsin Republican Party, quickly turned his sights to the November 2012 presidential election, telling the conservative TV talk show host that President Barack Obama is not a mainstream Democrat. The example cited: Taxes. "And you know, what does Barack Obama want to do?" Priebus asked. "Raise the poorest -- the lowest tax rate -- from 10 to 15 percent." There’s been a fierce debate in recent months about whether the wealthiest Americans should pay more in income taxes. But does Obama really want to raise the lowest income rate by half to 15 percent? Bush-era tax cuts When we asked Republican National Committee spokesman Ryan Mahoney for evidence to back Priebus’ claim, he said the lowest rate would rise to 15 percent if the so-called Bush-era tax cuts are allowed to expire. So, let’s first get an understanding of those. As we noted in rating Mostly False a U.S. Chamber of Commerce claim against U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the tax cuts -- on income, capital gains, dividends and business -- were enacted in 2001 and 2003 under GOP President George W. Bush. Their major provisions were to expire at the end of 2010. In December 2010, Congress voted to extend the tax cuts through 2012 and Obama signed the measure into law. But where does Obama stand now on extending the cuts and maintaining the lowest income tax rate at 10 percent? Priebus’ evidence Mahoney provided six pieces of information that he said show what Obama "has considered doing" in relation to the tax cuts. 1. A February 2010 Bloomberg news article quoted Obama as saying he is "agnostic" about raising taxes on households that earn less than $250,000 (and individuals who earn less than $200,000). At most, that’s an indication Obama -- more than two years ago -- was open to raising taxes on non-wealthy Americans. The article doesn’t address raising the lowest tax rate to 15 percent. 2. A February 2012 book, The Escape Artists by Noam Scheiber, says Obama was "intrigued" -- in 2009 -- by the idea of allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. Being "intrigued" by an idea three years ago doesn’t show Obama now wants to allow the tax cuts to expire in a way that would raise the lowest tax rate. 3. In July 2011, The Washington Post reported that a White House official "argued" Obama could block extension of the Bush tax cuts, either as a final act in office or after winning a second term. But a staff member’s strategizing or speculation nearly a year ago doesn’t equate to what the president wants to do now in terms of the lowest tax rate. 4. The same day, Post blogger Ezra Klein pointed out the Democrats wouldn’t have to take any action in order for the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of 2012. That’s not evidence of Obama’s intent, however. Moreover, the opinion article also says that about four-fifths of the Bush tax cuts go to households making less than $250,000 a year," and that the Obama administration doesn’t "want to raise taxes on those folks." 5. Then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden said in a National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare survey in 2007 he would "roll back tax cuts on dividends and capital gains." Not only is that not a statement about Obama’s desires, it’s not even a statement about income tax rates. 6. New Yorker Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza wrote in June 2012 about federal tax and budget discussions between Republicans and Democrats, saying: "Several White House officials I talked to made it clear that if a deal, or at least the framework for a deal, is not reached before December 31st Obama would allow all the Bush tax cuts to expire -- a tactic that would achieve huge deficit reduction, but in a particularly painful and ill-conceived fashion. The administration is preparing for that outcome, and Republicans may not be willing to budge without the threat of this cataclysm." Lizza wrote that Obama senior adviser David Plouffe said, "I think we’re going to have the ability to tell the American people, ‘Hey, your taxes may go up on January 1st because these guys refuse to ask the wealthy to do anything. Hey, there are going to be cuts in spending that aren’t done as smartly as they could because these guys won’t agree to ask anything from the wealthy.’ " This suggests that if a fiscal compromise with the GOP can’t be reached, Obama might allow the tax cuts to expire, which would raise the lowest rate to 15 percent. But that’s not evidence that Obama, as Priebus claimed, wants to raise the rate. Other evidence We asked for a response from Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama’s campaign in Wisconsin. She noted that in his 2013 budget message, issued in February 2012, Obama opposed extending the Bush tax for families earning over $250,000 per year. But he supports extending the rest of the tax cuts, Morris said. We also interviewed tax experts at two national think tanks: Alan Viard, resident scholar of the conservative American Enterprise Institute; and Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. They agreed that if the Bush tax cuts expire, the lowest income tax rate would rise to 15 percent from 10 percent. But they also agreed that Obama has consistently backed extending the Bush tax cuts for everyone but families earning $250,000 and individuals earning $200,000. Under Obama’s proposal, Williams said, the two highest tax rates would rise to 36 percent from 33 percent and to 39.6 percent from 35 percent. But the lowest rate would remain at 10 percent. Our rating Priebus said Obama wants to raise "the lowest (income) tax rate from 10 to 15 percent." He provided no evidence that that is the president’s position. And experts agree Obama does not support raising the lowest rate. We rate Priebus’ statement False.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2012-06-17T09:00:00	2012-06-05	['None']

Gerry Connolly, D-Va., addressed the recent jump in gasoline prices, saying that energy independence and lower gasoline prices will come from higher automobile fuel efficiency and new sources of domestic energy, including wind, solar and biofuels. In making the argument, Connolly cited a statistic showing how out-of-proportion the United States’ oil consumption is. "America owns 3 percent of the world’s oil but consumes 25 percent of its global reserves," Connolly said. We thought we’d check his statistic. We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal clearinghouse for energy statistics. For the first part of Connolly’s statement -- "America owns 3 percent of the world’s oil" -- we turned to a table showing proven reserves of crude oil internationally. For 2009 -- the most recent year with full data available -- the United States had proven reserves of slightly under 20.7 billion barrels, compared with more than 1.34 trillion barrels for the world as a whole. That works out to be 1.5 percent of the world total -- about half of what Connolly said, but still a small percentage of the global total. As for the second part of his statement -- that the U.S. "consumes 25 percent of (the world’s) global reserves" -- we found an EIA table showing international oil consumption. For 2009, the U.S. consumed 18.8 million barrels a day, compared with 84.3 million barrels a day for the world as a whole. That works out to 22 percent -- a little low, but once again, in the right ballpark. When we checked with Connolly’s office, they sent us a few documents with figures more in line with the ones the congressman had cited, but when we looked at them, we noticed that they cited statistics from between 1999 and 2004. So we’ll stick with our numbers. Bottom line: Connolly’s numbers are a little low because they are out of date, but his general point -- the U.S. consumes a disproportionate share of the world’s oil -- is valid. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Gerry Connolly	None	None	None	2011-05-05T09:50:09	2011-05-03	['United_States']
pomt-14493	Says Donald Trump hired illegal workers "from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/25/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-donald-trump-had-pay-1-million-hi/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio charged Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump with hypocrisy for hiring undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects instead of American citizens. "He hired from Poland, and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment," Rubio said. "That’s a fact. People can look it up. I’m sure people are Googling it right now, ‘Trump Polish workers.’ You’ll see $1 million for hiring illegal workers on one of his projects. He did." "Wrong, wrong," Trump said. We did some Googling and also reached out to the Rubio campaign, which referred us to media reports about a protracted class-action lawsuit involving his hiring of Polish aliens 36 years ago. Rubio is right about the Polish workers, but it’s unclear how much Trump ended up paying. (The Trump campaign did not get back to us.) Here’s the story. Sometime between 1979 and 1980, Trump hired a contractor to demolish an old building in midtown Manhattan to make way for Trump Tower. The contractor signed on workers from a local union and, to meet Trump’s tight deadline, also brought on 200 undocumented laborers from Poland dubbed the "Polish Brigade." The Polish employees were off-the-books, working 12-hour shifts seven days a week for $4 to $5 an hour, with no overtime. Some workers were never paid what they were owed. In 1983, union members sued a union boss, Trump and his contractor for cheating the union out of pension and welfare funds by hiring the Polish Brigade. Trump owed the union pension fund $1 million, the plaintiffs said. Appearing in court in 1990, Trump blamed the violations on the contractor and denied knowing that the Polish workers were undocumented. "Nobody’s proven to me that they were were illegal," Trump said, according to a Newsday report from the time. Nonetheless, Manhattan Judge Charles Stewart ruled against Trump a year later, saying that his representative "knew that the Polish workers were doing demolition work" and that his company participated in a "conspiracy" to cheat the union. Trump owed the workers a little more than $325,000 plus interest and attorney’s fees and costs, Stewart ruled. That wasn’t the end of it. Trump appealed and it would drag on for another decade. In 1998, several members of the Polish Brigade told the New York Times about their horrid working conditions. But Trump repeated that he didn’t know about the legal status of the Polish Brigade and said he would not settle the case out of court "on principle," according to the New York Times. If the case was retried and Trump lost again, he would have had to pay about $4 million, the Times calculated. A year later, Trump quietly settled, according to the New York Daily News, but the agreement was placed under seal. "It has been resolved on terms agreeable to both sides," labor lawyer Wendy Sloan, who represented the union members, told the New York Daily News. Our ruling Rubio said Trump "hired from Poland and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment." It was Trump’s contractor, not Trump himself, who hired 200 undocumented Polish workers to demolish a building to make room for Trump Tower in Manhattan. Trump said he didn’t know. The lawsuit sought $1 million in damages, and a judge ruled that Trump had to pay $325,000 plus interest. But the case was appealed and before it was retried, Trump settled the case out of court, so it’s unclear how much he ended up doling out. Rubio’s statement is partially accurate but missing that context.

pomt-03092	The U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1982 that non-citizen children must get free K-12 education.	true	/texas/statements/2013/sep/25/david-watts/1982-supreme-court-decision-texas-case-said-public/	Running for Texas land commissioner, Republican David Watts noted in a campaign email Sept. 16, 2013, that a big part of the job is managing public land to generate money for public schools. To make that money go farther, he said, Texas should use it only for educating children here legally. "Unfortunately," Watts wrote, "the (U.S.) Supreme Court decided in 1982 (Plyler v. Doe) that non-citizen children of illegal immigrants (children born in another country and brought into the U.S. by their illegal immigrant parents) must be given a free K-12 education." We wondered about the details of this 30-year-old decision in a Texas case that is sometimes compared to the landmark Brown v. Board of Education anti-segregation ruling but has "none of the same fame," as a Dallas Morning News retrospective news story said June 11, 2007. "It is absent from Texas history lessons. … Yet the Plyler case has been used as a defense against countless proposals aiming to deny rights to illegal immigrants," the News story said, because it affirmed that a constitutional protection covered people who were illegally living in the United States. Watts, a businessman who lives outside Longview, emailed us links to the Plyler opinion and analysis of it, plus a Dec. 5, 2010, Dallas Morning News news story that used data from the Pew Hispanic Center, state government and other sources to estimate that 3 percent of Texas schoolchildren in 2009 were in the United States illegally and educating them cost the state more than $1 billion per year. Texas’ Legislature, the Plyler opinion said, changed state education law in 1975 to let school districts refuse entry to children who weren’t legal U.S. residents and to allow the state to hold back money being sent to districts to educate such students. Two years later, Tyler’s school district began charging $1,000 tuition per year for children without legal documentation. A class-action lawsuit naming Tyler school superintendent James Plyler went to Judge William Wayne Justice’s U.S. District Court for Texas’ Eastern District. In his 1978 ruling, Justice, already known for groundbreaking decisions in civil rights cases, agreed with the plaintiffs that Texas’ law (and Tyler’s policy) broke the 14th Amendment "equal protection" guarantee that laws in the U.S. be applied to all people in the same way. Undocumented children, Justice found, have the same right to attend public schools in Texas as U.S. citizens. His decision was upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then, in 1982, by the U.S. Supreme Court, which extended the right nationwide. Texas had argued, in part, that illegal immigrants were not protected by the 14th Amendment. Justice found, and the Supreme Court affirmed, that though not citizens of the U.S., they were "within its jurisdiction," as the amendment puts it, and so effectively denying the children an education because of their illegal status was unconstitutional. We checked Watts’ claim against the Supreme Court’s words. Watts specified that the ruling applied to "non-citizen children of illegal immigrants (children born in another country and brought into the U.S. by their illegal immigrant parents)" and that the Supreme Court said they "must be given a free K-12 education." The parents’ legal status wasn’t at issue in this case, and how the children entered the country was raised in the legal debate -- typically it was held that the children were not responsible for breaking immigration law because their parents made the decisions -- but it also was not an essential part of the law or the court rulings. The high court’s Plyler opinion begins, "The question presented by these cases is whether, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Texas may deny to undocumented school-age children the free public education that it provides to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens." K-12, kindergarten through 12th grade, spans elementary education plus middle school and high school, which is what Texas school districts provide at no cost to students, though families and others pay school-supporting taxes. Public state universities offer "higher" education, but charge tuition and also depend on tax-generated aid. (Texas and some other states, using logic similar to that in the Plyler decision, offer in-state tuition rates to non-citizens who graduated from the state’s public schools.) Texas’ 1975 election law changes, as quoted in Justice’s opinion, said any child who was "a citizen of the United States or a legally admitted alien" could attend Texas districts’ public schools and benefit from state education dollars. The Supreme Court decision, which was delivered by Justice William Brennan and frequently cited Justice’s findings, examined the parts of Texas’ argument that hinged on the children’s illegal status and concluded Texas had not proven it was justified in singling them out. Texas argued it was in the state’s interest to keep resources focused on educating legal residents. In the Supreme Court opinion, Brennan wrote that because citizenship was a federal status, Texas’ law had to fit in with the purposes of federal laws. If Texas was claiming it would help keep illegal immigrants out of the U.S., Brennan said, then this education law was a poor way to achieve that. If Texas was claiming that these children imposed a financial burden that lowered the statewide quality of education, Brennan said, then it had failed to provide (as Justice wrote) "any credible evidence" that was so. Finally, Brennan said, Texas appeared to be suggesting that these children were less likely to stay in the U.S. because of their legal status, meaning the state would not benefit from their future productivity -- so using their legal status as a criterion for keeping them out was justified. Brennan said Texas had no way to know whether any schoolchildren, legal or not, would use their education in Texas, and that "the record is clear" many non-citizen children would stay in the U.S. "It is difficult to understand precisely what the state hopes to achieve by promoting the creation and perpetuation of a subclass of illiterates within our boundaries, surely adding to the problems and costs of unemployment, welfare, and crime," he wrote. "It is thus clear that whatever savings might be achieved by denying these children an education, they are wholly insubstantial in light of the costs involved to these children, the state, and the nation." Brennan concluded, "If the State is to deny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other children residing within its borders, that denial must be justified by a showing that it furthers some substantial state interest. No such showing was made here. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals in each of these cases is affirmed." Our ruling Watts said the Supreme Court decided in 1982 that non-citizen children must get a free K-12 education.

pomt-01302	Leticia Van de Putte "voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/oct/29/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-leticia-van-de-putte-voted-stop-s/	A TV ad from Republican Dan Patrick, a Houston state senator, unsurprisingly criticizes his Democratic opponent for lieutenant governor, Leticia Van de Putte, for opposing "school choice," which can describe public dollars made available for students to attend private schools. Another statement in the ad delivers more of a shock: "Liberal Leticia actually voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony," the narrator says, "convicted" appearing in red. We were unaware of any lawmakers voting to keep schools from firing felons. By email, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said the claim reflected a vote by Van de Putte, a San Antonio state senator, against a 2011 measure passed into law making it easier for Texas schools to fire teachers convicted of felonies. We looked at the change in law and at Van de Putte’s related votes on House Bill 1610, which originated in the House but was carried in the Senate by Patrick. Then we gauged if her ultimate opposition to the proposal was the same as voting against schools removing felons. House Bill 1610 The adopted change in law permitted a school that becomes aware of a worker’s felony conviction to suspend the employee without pay or void his or her contract and terminate the worker "as soon as practicable," without a provision for teacher appeals. Teacher groups and the Texas Education Agency told us districts already could remove felons. But under the previous law, teachers had "due process" rights. Those were eliminated by the 2011 measure, potentially saving school districts time and money. By email, Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Lauren Callahan said the pre-2011 law said a district could terminate a teacher for "good cause" after giving proper notice and giving the teacher the option of a hearing and possible appeal to the state education commissioner. "For teachers convicted of a felony, HB 1610 removed the teacher’s right to notice, a hearing and appeal to the commissioner," Callahan said. which made "it quicker, easier and cheaper for school districts to terminate teachers convicted of felonies." Callahan also pointed out a pro-and-con House Research Organization analysis of the legislation cited by Patrick stating that under the previous law, a teacher could be immediately fired only if he or she was convicted of a violent crime or a crime against a minor, leaving out crimes that destroy public trust, such as theft, burglary, and embezzlement, the report said. In contrast, the analysis said, opponents of the proposal said the changes could lead to a teacher losing his or her teaching certificate for any felony, which could punish some teachers needlessly for mistakes made in their younger years. The report continued: "The current system works and should be maintained. The bill would take away a teacher’s right to due process by prohibiting an appeal. If a school district or charter school was wrong to terminate a teacher, the teacher would have no recourse to challenge the decision." Van de Putte’s actions We divined more detail from legislative records including audio and video available online. According to March 22, 2011, testimony by a Houston-area school lawyer to the Texas House Committee on Public Education, under the old law districts wishing to act against a felon-teacher had to present a case for termination before an independent hearing examiner, a process costing money and taking 90 to 120 days, lawyer David Hodgins testified. "These are very rare situations," Hodgins told the House panel. "But when they do happen, they are very critical to a school district." According to a May 2011 summary of the legislation by the Texas Senate Research Center, an educator convicted of certain felonies, including felonies involving a minor, already could have their teaching certificate revoked. The summary said the law also required that an educator be removed from campus or administrative office upon notice of the conviction, but the law didn’t require anyone to be fired immediately. "As a result, many school districts place these individuals on paid administrative leave when scheduled for termination rather than go through a costly administrative hearing process," the center said. In the 2011 session, the Texas State Teachers Association, Association of Texas Professional Educators and Texas Federation of Teachers opposed the quick-termination proposal, while it the support of the Texas Association of School Boards and Texas Association of School Administrators, according to witness lists created by House and Senate committees that advanced the measure. According to Texas Senate records, Van de Putte supported and opposed the proposal at different times. Specifically: --On March 23, 2011, she voted for a committee substitute for the House-originated proposal and asked to be shown as making the motion to send the revised measure to the full Senate; --On May 21, 2011, when the Senate took up the proposal, she expressed misgivings about the sweep of the plan, but also told colleagues that "certainly" if a teacher was convicted of a felon, his or her school should be able to act quickly. Van de Putte also unsuccessfully offered an amendment to remove the provision for quickly terminating school employees who’d received "deferred adjudication" for felonies. "My worry," she told colleagues, "is that deferred adjudication does not imply guilt." Her amendment also sought to limit those felonies enabling speedy firings to ones related to a worker’s job performance. Senators tabled her amendment after Patrick said it "guts the bill." --A moment later, she was among nine Democrats to vote against the final version of the proposal. By email, Van de Putte spokesman Manny Garcia said Van de Putte made her favorable committee motion as a favor to the panel’s chair, then-Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano. Garcia said Van de Putte voted for the same version in committee "because she supported it in principle, however she also acted in good faith that her concerns of the bill being overly broad would be addressed on" the "Senate floor, where she would offer an amendment." Garcia said: "Her concerns were that the language of the bill did not account for when the offense occurred in that person’s life and allowed for it to include" a "first-time felony-level off-duty DWI conviction." After her proposed changes were spurned by the Senate, he said, she voted against final approval. Meaning of voting 'no' So, was the Democrat’s "no" vote in the end also a vote to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of felonies, as Patrick says? Callahan of the education agency offered no comment on that while teacher groups, some supportive of Van de Putte’s candidacy, each stressed the previous law’s permission for districts to fire teachers for good cause. Monty Exter, lobbyist for the ATPE, said by email: "Voting down HB 1610 would not have stopped schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony; it would have simply required districts to continue to observe the teachers’ due-process rights in situations not already covered by" a measure passed into law in 2007. That year’s Senate Bill 9 required districts to remove a teacher convicted of either violent crimes or a crime requiring registration as a sex offender. Van de Putte voted for its final passage. By phone, Lonnie Hollingsworth, an attorney and advocate for the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, said Patrick’s claim was largely incorrect, though it is so that Van de Putte voted to stop schools from terminating teachers convicted of a felony "without due process." Our ruling Patrick said Van de Putte "voted to stop schools from removing teachers convicted of a felony." Nope. There was never a vote to stop schools from firing teachers convicted of a felony. Still, Van de Putte voted against making it easier to terminate such teachers – a toughening that was supported by Patrick to wipe out the right of teachers to request an independent hearing before being let go.

pomt-14499	Says that in the Philippines more than a century ago, Gen. John Pershing "took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood," and shot 49 Muslim rebels. "The 50th person, he said, ‘You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.’ And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-cites-dubious-legend-about-gen-pershi/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised eyebrows during a recent rally when he offered a counterinsurgency parable from more than a century ago that featured United States Army Gen. John Joseph "Black Jack" Pershing. During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War. Help PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate. After taking the reins of power from Spain, the United States faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 American combatants, more than 20,000 Filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians, according to the State Department. After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies. "They were having terrorism problems, just like we do," Trump said, according to an account in the Washington Post. "And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem." After Trump told this story, critics called it apocryphal, misleading or outright false. Our friends at Snopes.com considered the evidence and called it a "legend." We decided to check with historians of the period to see what they thought of the story. We heard back from eight scholars. Most expressed skepticism that the specific story ever happened, and many added that Trump’s takeaway is wrong-headed. We’ll take a look at those two concerns separately below. Did it happen? The idea that pig’s blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades. For instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin "to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers," Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently. Snopes has been tracking Internet-based rumors of this sort since 2001, and a California National Guard facility removed a poster telling the Pershing story in 2005. But the only historical evidence that something like this actually happened appears to come from a letter written by a soldier who served in the Philippines. "Mr. C.C. Booth of Dallas, Texas, who served in Mindanao under Pershing, recalls seeing him hang a Moro chieftain by the heels over an open grave, kill a pig, and then drop the Moro into the grave with the bloody animal," according to a 1962 article by Donald Smythe in the Pacific Historical Review, an academic journal. However, David J. Silbey, a Cornell University historian and author of A War of Frontier and Empire: The Philippine-American War, 1899-1902, raised red flags about its sourcing. This claim came from one letter -- and one that was written in 1960, more than half a century after the events in question. (And for the sake of this fact-check, the details differ significantly from the story Trump told.) Other historians agreed that the evidence is thin, to say the least. "This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited," said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. "I am amazed it is still making the rounds." Christopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that "I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character." Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to "pacifying" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors. "He did a lot of what we would call ‘winning hearts and minds’ and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. "He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn’t negotiate with him. He wasn’t solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply." Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It’s unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions. "The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims," Janda said. "This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism." Facts aside, Trump’s larger point is wrong To many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing’s hypothetical blood-dipped bullets pacified "terrorists" is actually the bigger problem with Trump’s parable. "Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense," said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region "remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present." Silbey of Cornell agreed. "Where Trump’s remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked," he said. "The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that’s a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig’s blood isn’t -- and wasn’t -- some magical method of ending terrorism." If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump’s narrative. "The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied," Janda said. "It’s a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies." Our ruling Of the eight historians we checked with, all were at least skeptical that what Trump said actually happened, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that. The only evidence of something approximating what Trump said stems from one letter documenting a different scenario written by a veteran more than a half century after the fact. Perhaps more important, the historians took issue with Trump’s suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years. In all, Trump’s claim is ridiculous, so we rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE, Feb. 29, 2016: After we published this story, a reader pointed us to a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col. Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents "were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins." In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: "Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics." While these writings do provide strong evidence that United States forces used pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents, they do not support the claim Trump made. There is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts, there is nothing said about the use of 50 bullets dipped in pig’s blood, and most important, there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim that this tactic was effective in stopping violence -- or that it would provide a useful policy today. When we ran this additional information by three of the historians we checked with for our original story -- Silbey, Linn and Janda -- they told us they agreed with our conclusion.

pomt-12365	"The waiting list for Pre-K is over in the House budget."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/jun/06/david-lewis/thousands-more-children-and-families-could-soon-ge/	Thousands of North Carolina parents hoping to get their children into free preschool classes might have cause for hope during budget negotiations this month. Last year, nearly 5,000 children were on a waiting list for NC Pre-K, the state-run program that prepares 4-year-olds for school. The N.C. House and Senate have each passed budget proposals, and now they’re negotiating which provisions to keep and which to change or jettison. One of the main budget writers in the House said that if his chamber gets its way on Pre-K funding, that waiting list could go away entirely – giving thousands of needy children an educational head start that their parents might not otherwise be able to afford. "The waiting list for Pre-K is over in the House budget," Rep. David Lewis, a Harnett County Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a tweet. So we started combing through the 356-page budget proposal to find out if he was right. Broad political agreement If Lewis is right – and if the final version of the budget ends up going in this direction – it would be a moment of bipartisan agreement. Expanding NC Pre-K was also one of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s campaign promises. We’re tracking about three dozen promises Cooper made on our Coop-O-Meter and have rated the Pre-K promise as In The Works. The state reported that for the current school year, NC Pre-K enrolled 27,019 children – with another 4,668 on the waiting list. State law caps Pre-K class sizes at 18 students, and there has to be one teacher for every nine students in a classroom. That means cutting down on the waiting list requires finding space for new classrooms, hiring more teachers or both. So how much will it cost to ensure that no eligible children are turned away? Budget proposals from the the state Senate and the governor’s office both estimated that each new seat costs around $5,200, and the program as a whole costs the state about $5,500 per seat. An initial look into Lewis’ claim, on the other hand, appeared to show the House relying on estimates that were only half that much. We sent an inquiry to Ellen Peisner-Feinberg, a Pre-K expert at UNC-Chapel Hill who is also the director of the National Pre-K and Early Learning Evaluation Center. She called that math "curious." So we wondered if the House discovered a way for the program to use funding more efficiently, or if perhaps something was amiss. That led us to get in touch with some state budget officials. They said there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation – and that Lewis was neither wrong nor using faulty accounting. Crunching the numbers The House, Senate and governor’s office all agree that North Carolina should use $6 million in federal grant money next school year and $12.2 million in 2018-19 to expand Pre-K funding. The Senate plan stops there. But Cooper would double it by matching that federal money with state funds. The House budget initially appears to follow the Senate plan, which led to the initial confusion. But in reality, the House – like Cooper – would require a state match. The average budget explorer might not realize that, however, because House budget writers omitted the additional state funds from some documents. "The House says it in their narrative but it doesn't show it in their numbers," said Pam Kilpatrick, North Carolina’s senior assistant state budget officer. The House, Senate and Cooper all agree it will cost right around $5,200 for each new seat. And those estimates jibe with recent history. Last year the state spent an extra $1.325 million on NC Pre-K and created 260 new seats, for an average of $5,096 per seat. Kilpatrick, the state budget expert, agreed that using both the federal funds and matching state money ought to be enough to get rid of the existing waiting list – just like Lewis said. "We're definitely in agreement," Kilpatrick said. "It's right on the money." Our ruling North Carolina Republican Rep. David Lewis, a top budget writer in the House of Representatives, said that chamber’s budget will eliminate the waiting list for NC Pre-K. The program, which serves needy children and military families, turned down 4,668 children this year due to a lack of seats, according to the state. And Lewis is right that the House’s version of the budget has enough money to create at least that many new seats if it becomes law. We rate this claim True.

pomt-11105	"Mitt Romney: ‘Trump has some very serious emotional problems, he must resign before we…’"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/08/blog-posting/hoax-story-wrongly-credits-mitt-romney-bernie-sand/	Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has taken aim at President Donald Trump before, but he never said Trump should resign because of "serious emotional problems," despite what one false headline would have readers believe. "Mitt Romney: ‘Trump has some very serious emotional problems, he must resign before we…’," said a June 6, 2018, headline from International Flash News, an online blog. A few replica stories were posted under the same headline on other blog sites in May. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The International Flash News story alleged that during an interview on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, Romney said Trump "has some very serious emotional problems." The story also quoted Romney as suggesting Trump should resign over sexual misconduct claims and expressing concern regarding the president’s tweets about North Korea and domestic race relations. We searched for the headline in Google and Nexis and found no evidence that Romney made such a statement. Shimrit Sheetrit, director of Anderson Cooper 360, told us it has been several years since Romney was last featured as a guest on the show. But as it turns out, we did find that the comments attributed to Romney in the false report were all at some point made by another former presidential candidate: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt. On Dec. 13, 2017, Sanders joined the set of Anderson Cooper 360 and said Trump "has some very serious emotional problems" in reference to a Twitter attack Trump made against U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. During the same interview, Sanders said Trump should resign because of the multiple sexual assault allegations levied against him. The International Flash News story also included quotes that can be properly attributed to Sanders’ statement on CBS This Morning on Dec. 7, 2017. And Sanders — not Romney — has on multiple occasions accused Trump of "trying to divide us up by the color of our skin," including on Nov. 12, 2017, while visiting CBS’s Face the Nation. So the supposed Romney quote, along with several others included in the text of the story, is actually a misattribution of multiple different quotes from Sanders.

pomt-01988	Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine voted "to let the U.N. take OUR guns."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/15/chain-email/chain-email-says-sens-mark-warner-and-tim-kaine-vo/	A chain email lists Virginia Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine among 46 "legistraitors" in the U.S. Senate who voted to let the United Nations seize the guns of Americans. "Folks: This needs to go viral," the email said. "These Senators voted to let the UN take OUR guns. They need to lose their next election. We have been betrayed." A reader recently sent us the dispatch and asked if it is true. We took a look, mindful that Warner, a Democrat, is up for reelection this fall. No group or individual takes credit for the email, which denounces the Arms Trade Treaty adopted by the U.N.’s General Assembly on April 2, 2013. The vote was 154 in favor, 3 opposed and 23 absent. The U.S. voted for it, while North Korea, Iran and Syria opposed it. The treaty, which took seven years to negotiate, is aimed at restricting the international flow of large and small arms to nations beset by terrorists or dictators with poor human rights records. President Barack Obama said he would sign the pact. But before the U.S. can be bound by any treaty, the agreement must be approved by the Senate. The U.N. treaty had long been opposed by the National Rifle Association and many other pro-gun groups, who said it could infringe on constitutional rights to own arms in the United States. Before the U.N’s approval of the accord, the Senate passed legislation, by a 53-46 vote, stating opposition to the treaty. Warner and Kaine voted with the minority that favored the pact. The email says that the treaty, in addition to allowing the U.N. to seize guns, "would have effectively placed a global ban on the import and export of small firearms. The ban would have affected all private gun owners in the U.S. and had language that would have implemented an international gun registry, now get this, on all private guns and ammo." Facts about the treaty Let’s look at the what the treaty actually does. It states its purpose is to "establish the highest possible common international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in conventional arms" and to "prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their diversion." It requires each participating country to establish its own controls over the export of ammunition and conventional arms. The pact prohibits sending the weapons to nations that are under a U.N. arms embargo or where the arms will be used for terrorism, genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva Conventions, attacks against civilians or other war crimes. The treaty calls on participating nations to take "appropriate measures" if they determine that a shipment has been diverted, although it does not clearly define those steps. The accord applies to tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery, combat aircraft and helicopters, warships, missiles, missile launchers and small arms such and handguns and rifles. Participating nations would be required to send annual reports to the U.N. on their imports and exports of conventional weapons. The treaty has no enforcement power, but supporters hope it will create common standards among countries for international trade of weapons. To go into effect, the pact must be ratified by the governments of 50 U.N. nations. To date, it has been ratified by 36 countries. The U.S. State Department says the treaty, if joined by the United States, would not put additional controls on the import or export of guns in America. Instead, it would require other countries to establish "control systems that are closer to the high standard the United States already sets with its own national standards," the State Department wrote in a fact sheet last September. What about the email’s contentions that the treaty would "let the U.N. take OUR guns," and "implement and international gun registry ... on all guns and private ammo?" There are no provisions for any of that in the treaty. To the contrary, the pact’s preamble affirms "the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system." Our ruling A chain email says Warner and Kaine were among 46 senators who voted to "let the U.N. take our guns." This is a wild distortion of the senators’ support for a U.N. Arms Trade Treaty that has no enforcement power but encourages nations to adopt common standards to block the flow of arms into nations beset by terrorists or dictators with brutal human rights records. The goal is to raise the international arms trade rules to standards already used by the United States. The treaty explicitly recognizes the sovereign rights of nations to control gun laws within its borders. So the assertion that the U.N. would be empowered to take guns from United States citizens is outlandish. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-04970	Says Texas proved in court that more than 200 dead people voted in the latest Texas election.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jul/24/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-dead-voters-Texas/	Greg Abbott, defending the state’s stalled voter identification law, said in a Fox News interview on July 15, 2012: "What we have proved in Texas is that voter fraud exists. We have more than 200 dead people who voted in the last election -- and we proved that in court in addition to the fact that the voter ID law will have no disenfranchisement effect on the voters in the state of Texas." We’ll set aside the last part of the Texas attorney general’s statement given that a federal judicial panel is reviewing the state’s case challenging the U.S. Department of Justice, which maintains that the state’s mandate that voters present photo IDs at the polls, passed into law in 2011, would prevent many voters from making it to the polls. The department’s objection has kept the law from taking effect. We were curious about Abbott’s claim that the state proved in the court showdown that more than 200 dead people voted in the latest election. To our inquiry, Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean passed along a fact sheet from Abbott’s office related to the just-completed trial. By email, Bean said an official with the Texas secretary of state’s office, which oversees elections, testified that it had found 239 people who voted in the May 2012 primaries "who were actually dead when they supposedly voted." Bean also forwarded a transcript of the trial proceedings of July 9, 2012, including questions posed by Adam Mortara, a Chicago lawyer representing the state, to Brian Keith Ingram, director of the secretary of state’s elections division. Mortara initially asked Ingram if he had evidence of deceased voters having their voter registration cards used in the May primaries. Ingram replied that he compared a list of 50,000 deceased Texas voters registered with "active voter unique identification numbers" to who voted in the May 29, 2012, party primaries. By email, Bean told us a list presented by the Justice Department at the trial identified 57,718 registered Texas voters as deceased. Bean said the comparison of that list to reports of who voted in the 2012 primaries revealed that 239 voter identification numbers belonging to deceased registered voters were used to cast ballots. Ingram put it this way in his testimony: "We believe 239 folks voted in the recent election after passing away" including, he said, 213 who voted in person. Mortara: "Have you done anything beyond that to confirm whether there are in fact deceased individuals who voted in the May elections?" Ingram: "Well, this was, of course, a surprising and troubling result so we took the best matches, the ones that had full nine Social Security number(s) in both databases, and we asked the Department of Vital Statistics to provide us with actual death certificates for as many of those as we could round up in a short time and we received 10 death certificates." Mortara: "Of the 10 death certificates you received how many of them do you think may have been dead people who voted in the May elections?" Ingram: "Four." Mortara: "And what led you to conclude from review of the death certificates that those four people had voted?" Ingram: "Their Social Security numbers matched, the names matched, the date of births matched and they pre-deceased before, they pre-deceased before the election. One (in) March of 2012, the rest of them from 2004, 2006, 2009." What happened with the other six seeming matches? By email, Bean told us that based on Ingram’s testimony and a conversation she had with the secretary of state’s office, at least one identifier -- a Social Security number, birth date or name -- "didn't match up completely on the death certificate." Ingram further said the state had not conducted such an investigation before because officials had not had both a list of active voter registration numbers belonging to deceased Texans plus a complete record of who had voted in statewide elections. Bean later told us by email that the 2011 Legislature voted to require counties to tell the state which voters had cast ballots after each primary, runoff or general or special election. Previously, she said, some counties voluntarily shared partial voting histories. So, the May 2012 primaries proved the first time every county had to send such information to the state, which hence was able to compare who voted in the primaries to the list of deceased voters identified by the Justice Department, she said. Mortara asked Ingram: "Does the investigation you performed on the May voting data tell you anything about the prevalence of in person voter fraud of this type?" Ingram replied: "It tells us that it's more common than we thought..." Under questioning from Elizabeth Westfall, a Justice Department attorney, Ingram referred to the four voters who used registration cards belonging to dead Texans as the ones he could confirm, but also said that’s being "very conservative." He said that all 239 would be referred to Abbott’s office. He agreed, though, that there had been no criminal investigations, prosecutions or convictions. Westfall asked if clerical errors could explain the 239 matches. Ingram said either the county reports of who voted in May or the state’s list of deceased residents could have errors. "I hope that that is the case for the majority of these," he testified, "but I know for four of them, it's not." We sought to interview state election officials about Ingram’s testimony. Rich Parsons, spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office, directed us to Abbott’s office, saying by email that the 239 "cases" have been referred to the attorney general’s office for possible investigation. We also asked the Department of Justice about Abbott’s claim. Spokesman Mitchell Rivard declined comment. Asked how the testimony proved Abbott’s claim, Bean stressed that Ingram spoke under oath. She added by email: "The dead voter number was subject to cross examination by judges, DOJ lawyers and lawyers for groups hostile to Voter ID." Our ruling Abbott said the recent trial proved that more than 200 dead people voted in the latest elections, the May 2012 party primaries. But the trial was less conclusive. To recap: An elections official testified that after comparing a list of 50,000 dead registered voters -- where’s that headline? -- to records of voters in the recent primaries, "we believe" that 239 "folks voted in the recent election after passing away," meaning 239 voters cast ballots using voter registrations of dead Texans. According to his testimony, the state then took the best matches and sought death certificates "for as many of those as we could round up in a short time." Ten death certificates came back and, the official testified, four names, birth dates and Social Security numbers completely aligned on the lists and death certificates. We can see how this information might raise flags, but we do not see that it proves there were more than 200 dead voters, so to speak. That's because there’s a difference between suspecting fraud and proving it. After all, Abbott's office has been handed the 200-plus matches to investigate. His claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-04822	Says "Paul Ryan supports banning all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/17/barack-obama/obama-says-ryan-supports-banning-all-abortions/	The day after Republican Mitt Romney announced Paul Ryan as his running mate, President Barack Obama’s campaign tweeted a gender-specific warning about the Wisconsin vice presidential pick. "Make sure the women in your life know: Paul Ryan supports banning all abortions, even in cases of rape or incest." The @BarackObama account has 18 million followers, and the Ryan abortion comment was widely circulated through more than 6,000 re-tweets. It’s one piece of the campaign’s effort to court the vote of women. The Obama claim has a familiar ring: his campaign ran an ad in July 2012 saying Romney "backed a bill that outlaws all abortions, even in cases of rape and incest." PolitiFact National rated that claim Pants on Fire, because Romney had made clear he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. But what about Ryan, the newly-minted vice presidential candidate? The seven-term congressman has taken a consistent anti-abortion stand -- National Right to Life says he has never voted against its position in 13 years -- that has earned him 100% ratings from anti-abortion groups and 0% ratings from abortion-rights organizations. News coverage of Ryan’s first congressional race in 1998, as well as statements he made to the National Right to Life Committee, a leading anti-abortion group, show Ryan has taken a stricter anti-abortion view than Romney. The only anti-abortion exception Ryan favors is situations where an abortion is needed to save the life of the mother, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The National Right to Life Committee concurs, based on information the group says it collected in 1998 and 2000 from Ryan as a candidate. So the Obama ad correctly claims that Ryan opposes abortions in cases of rape and incest. But the tweet also says Ryan "supports banning all abortions." That appears to go too far. From his first campaigns, in 1998 and in 2000, Ryan has said he supports an exception to any abortion ban for when the life of the mother is at risk. Abortions in such cases are rare, but they do occur. The Obama campaign argues Ryan has been inconsistent on that point, saying Ryan does not back that exemption in cases involving a procedure known as "partial birth" abortion. They point to a quote from Ryan in his 1998 campaign, from a Kenosha News story, that he supports an "unqualified" ban on late-term abortions. But we found strong evidence that Ryan has favored a life exception in partial-birth cases, including an Oct. 30, 1998 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story. Ryan's campaign told us he favors the life exception in those cases, and the National Right to Life Committee says it believes that is his position based on its surveys over the years. The partial-birth abortion ban enacted in 2003 was written with a life-of-the-mother exception. Ryan voted for that law. As for Ryan’s current views, there is no indication they have changed. Since entering Congress, Ryan has focused on budget and fiscal issues so his views on abortion and social issues have not received much attention. Other evidence There is another, more recent, piece of information to consider. Ryan is among 64 House Republicans who co-sponsored the Sanctity of Human Life Act, an anti-abortion bill that declares that human life shall be deemed to begin at fertilization, and should be protected from that point. The legislation, which has stalled, reflects the budding movement -- endorsed by Ryan -- to enact "personhood" rights for the unborn. It would weaken the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision by "giving back the right to individual states to outlaw abortion," according to Gualberto Garcia Jones, legal analyst for Personhood USA. Abortion-rights advocates say the measure would go further. It would nullify Roe v. Wade and create legal uncertainty about abortions, said Donna Crane of NARAL Pro-Choice America. Neither side in this debate, though, claims the measure would immediately outlaw abortions. That would be up to Congress and/or individual states in subsequent legislation, if the Human Life Act holds up in the courts. And the measure does not deal with what exceptions -- if any -- would be allowed. It leaves that up to states or Congress to decide. Some legal observers, such as Harvard University’s I. Glenn Cohen say, that the measure’s declarations -- the right to life "is the paramount and most fundamental right of a person" and "every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood" -- can be read as hostile to the life of the mother exception. Our conclusion President Obama, through a campaign tweet, pegged Paul Ryan as supporting a ban on abortions, "even in cases of rape or incest." Ryan does oppose those exceptions. Obama’s Twitter claim misfires in saying Ryan supports banning "all" abortions. He has supported an exception when a mother’s life is at stake. That’s an important detail that is left out. We rate Obama’s claim Half True. Editor's Note: This item was changed on Oct. 26, 2012 to correct the record on Paul Ryan's position on exceptions to a partial-birth abortion ban. That National Right to Life Committee pointed out an inconsistency between our our original description of Ryan's position and the documentation cited in the item. After further reporting, we have changed the item to reflect that Ryan has supported an exception to the ban in cases where the life of the mother is in danger. Such an exception was written into the partial-birth abortion law passed in 2003.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-08-17T09:00:00	2012-08-17	['None']
pomt-04331	"One industry in America has increased its employment base in the last four years by 176,000 people: the United States government."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/oct/26/johnny-isakson/need-job-obamas-hiring-georgia-senator-says/	There’s been much said about the dearth of "Help Wanted" signs across America, but one lawmaker from Georgia recently talked about a place where there’s been an increase in the workforce in recent years. "One industry in America has increased its employment base in the last four years by 176,000 people: the United States government," U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Marietta Republican, told a group of community leaders at an Oct. 11 luncheon in Cobb County. Isakson’s larger point was that the federal government is not making the hard choices to spend wisely, as American families are doing, according to an article in The Marietta Daily Journal. Since the Great Recession, we’ve heard much about state and local governments laying off employees to cope with the decline in tax revenue. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the senator was correct about an actual increase in the number of employees on Uncle Sam’s payroll. USA Today reported earlier this year that federal employment grew 13 percent — 250,000 jobs — from the recession's start in December 2007 to a peak in September. During that time, private employment fell 5 percent and state and local governments cut staffs by 2 percent. Under President Barack Obama, the federal government has attempted to ease hiring processes and been more aggressive in hiring Latinos, The Washington Post recently reported. Obama's budget calls for a small increase in federal workers, although the president has frozen employee salaries for more than two years. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has criticized Obama for the increase in the size of the federal workforce under his administration. Romney has proposed cutting the federal workforce by 10 percent. For every two employees who retire, Romney’s goal would be to hire one new federal worker, according to the Post. The federal Office of Personnel Management has data on its website with an annual total of federal employees dating to 1962. It includes Postal Service employees. The number of federal employees rose the greatest, by 22 percent, when Democrat Lyndon Johnson was in the White House during the mid- to late 1960s. The number of federal employees was at its highest in 1990, when Republican George H.W. Bush was president. Federal employees represent slightly more than 1 percent of the nation’s total workforce, a statistic that has changed little in recent years, according to government data. Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson said the senator came up with the figure after reviewing data from the Office of Personnel Management’s website. The most recent month available was June 2012, which showed the federal government had 2,115,707 workers. Isakson’s office compared it with September 2008. The federal government had 1,938,821 workers that month, according to that website. The difference is 176,886. The website does not have figures for June 2008. The data include people who work for Cabinet-level agencies, larger agencies such as NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration and more obscure ones such as the Railroad Retirement Board and the Marine Mammal Commission. It does not include enlisted members of the U.S. military. If you were wondering, the Office of Personnel Management said it does not include people hired to conduct the U.S. Census in its count of the federal workforce. The Census Bureau needed to fill 1.2 million part-time positions for the work. It does include statisticians who were temporarily hired to help with the census. The Partnership for Public Service, a Washington-based, nonpartisan organization that works on ways to help federal workers improve their jobs and ideas when they fall short. The organization also uses the Office of Personnel Management numbers to measure the size of the federal workforce. Staffers there noted that the numbers Isakson used to make his comparison included seasonal and part-time workers. PolitiFact Georgia found a breakdown of full-time federal workers in September 2008 and June 2012. The increase was 178,857, which is slightly more than what Isakson cited in his speech in Cobb County. The biggest increases during this time period were in the Defense, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security departments. To sum up, Isakson said the federal workforce has increased by about 176,000 between September 2008 and June 2012. His claim is accurate if you examine full-time workers and include those working for Uncle Sam on a part-time or seasonal basis. Our rating: True.

pomt-12707	Says he presented "a balanced budget."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2017/mar/09/bruce-rauner/rauners-budget-balancing-claim-doesnt-add/	In his annual budget speech, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner said he was presenting a balanced budget. "Today we present you with a balanced budget that shows what is possible if we all come together on a comprehensive approach to state finances and job creation" the governor said. The next morning, his campaign sent an email underscoring that he had offered a balanced budget proposal for the next fiscal year. "Governor Bruce Rauner yesterday outlined a plan to balance the budget that reforms Illinois and builds a new economy," the email read. It included a link to a new, Rauner-funded website, www.budgetandreform.com. The website features a campaign ad that repeats the claim that the governor, who is embroiled in an unprecedented budget stalemate with majority Democrats, has proposed a balanced budget. The ad’s narrator says, "Bruce Rauner's plan to balance the budget reforms Illinois, builds a new economy, freezes property taxes, caps spending, pays down the debt and term limits politicians' power." With so many assertions that Rauner, who has yet to sign a budget into law since his election in 2014, had proposed a balanced revenue and spending plan, we decided to check it out. Balancing the rhetoric Article 8, Section 2a of the Illinois Constitution states, "The Governor shall prepare and submit to the General Assembly, at a time prescribed by law, a State budget for the ensuing fiscal year. … Proposed expenditures shall not exceed funds estimated to be available for the fiscal year as shown in the budget." Illinois has not had a full budget enacted into law since 2014. In 2015, Rauner vetoed the budget bills majority Democrats approved, except for the bill that funded pre K-12 education. His 2017 budget proposal is his third since taking office after winning election in his first run for a public position. He previously worked as a highly successful private equity financier. Since his 2017 budget speech last month, Democratic opponents have suggested Rauner’s plan is $4.6 billion to $7 billion out of balance. Page 30 of the budget book released the day of the speech by the governor’s office of management and budget includes a fiscal year 2018 summary page that has a line that says the budget is balanced with $4.57 billion by "working together on a grand bargain." The "grand bargain" refers to efforts by Illinois Senate President John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, and Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno of Lemont to strike a complicated, 12-bill compromise on several major topics that combine new or increased taxes to generate revenue along with business and political reforms aimed at strengthening the state economy and boosting public confidence in government. To date, such a bargain has not come to fruition. The governor’s press office referred questions about the balanced budget claims to Illinois Republican Party spokesman Steven Yaffe. Asked via email to provide the original source for the statement that the governor’s budget proposal was balanced, Yaffe said, "As stated in his budget address, Governor Rauner's plan to balance the budget includes freezing property taxes, capping spending, paying down the debt, and term-limiting career politicians." When asked again for the original source of that statement, Yaffe said, "His plan to balance the budget includes these four items. That's what the advertisement is saying. These four items are keys to passing a bipartisan balanced budget plan in the General Assembly. The final plan is obviously still being negotiated, but these reforms are critical." Despite repeated requests, Yaffe did not offer an original source but said, "The ad is accurate." In his speech, the governor acknowledged he expected Democrats to attack him for not proposing a balanced budget and noted the Legislature’s controlling party has not approved a balanced budget for years. "It’s not going to help us move forward if right after this speech, Democrats run to the media claiming we’ve never proposed a plan to balance the budget," he said. "And it’s not going to help us move forward if Republicans run to the media to point out that the Democratic legislature’s never passed a balanced budget. People want to see us get something done – to get a balanced budget to change our broken system." Chris Mooney, director of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois, noted the concept of a balanced budget has been a difficult one for many Illinois governors and legislators over many years. "The word ‘balanced’ seems to have become a politically malleable term. And not just with Rauner," he said, noting former Democratic Govs. Pat Quinn, Rod Blagojevich and others have bent the meaning. "It is in some sense institutionalized and hidden by all the special funds. So does the proposed budget have expenditures equal to revenues in clear, concrete and plausible terms? It doesn’t look like it. "I think the term has been stretched so far by both sides of the aisles and both branches over recent years," Mooney added, that he would "hardly blame" the governor for "playing this ongoing political word game." Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a liberal-leaning think tank, didn’t concern himself with rhetoric. "The FY2018 General Fund budget proposed by Governor Rauner cannot be considered balanced by any objective standard for two reasons: first, it relies on over $1 billion in unspecified and unlikely savings from ‘pension reforms’ that are not only unlikely to pass, but if they did, would likely be ruled unconstitutional; second, and even more troubling, is the $4.572 billion in ‘savings’ the governor anticipates from ‘working together on a grand bargain’ -- which is so ambiguous that it cannot credibly be valued at all." Sheila Weinberg, a certified public accountant and the founder of Truth in Accounting, a government finance think tank said, "Our elected officials have been claiming ‘balanced’ budgets for decades, but the state owes more than $187 billion. Mostly likely the governor is not including all of the state’s employee compensation costs in his calculations." Our ruling Gov. Rauner said he proposed a balanced budget. "Today we present you with a balanced budget that shows what is possible if we all come together on a comprehensive approach to state finances and job creation" the governor told lawmakers. Yet, the budget book produced by the governor’s office of management and budget suggests the budget is balanced by "working together on a grand bargain." A so-called grand bargain budget compromise, though, has not been achieved or enacted. Illinois government finance experts agree Rauner’s proposal is not balanced. We rate this claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-14068	"We just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-2015-was-best-year-us-auto-in/	On the campaign trail, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has pitched herself as someone who will continue many of President Barack Obama’s policies. At a campaign rally in Kentucky May 16, Clinton praised the 2009 auto industry bailout, which people view as an Obama success. "We saved the auto industry," she said. "That’s important in Louisville. It’s important in Bowling Green. It’s important in Northern Kentucky. It’s important across this commonwealth. That’s a big difference between me and my opponent in the primary. I voted to save the auto industry, he voted not to. It’s important to know that it was the right vote because we just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history." We’ve already looked into how Clinton’s primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, voted on the auto bailout, which totaled an estimated $85 billion. But we were also curious about Clinton’s claim that 2015 was "the best year for the auto industry in America in history." This is true by one big measure: Americans bought more cars and trucks in 2015 than ever before. But that success might mask long-term issues with American manufacturers, especially given foreign manufacturers’ growing market share. In 2015, Americans bought more than 17.5 million cars. The last peak was 17.3 million in 2000, followed by a collapse to 10.4 million at the height of the recession in 2009. Additionally, the past six years have been the longest period of sustained year-over-year growth in auto sales since the 1920s, according to Auto Alliance, a vehicle manufacturer association. Vehicle sales wax and wane with the economy. Wards Auto, an analytics organization, has tracked vehicle sales since 1963. When times are tough, vehicles become a discretionary purchase that consumers are willing to put off. Analysts believe car sales have done so well in the past couple of years because of a combination of the improving economy, cheap gas prices, available credit and low interest rates for loans. Experts we asked agreed with Clinton’s claim, saying the sales figures are a reasonable way to measure the auto industry’s health. "She's right," said Bruce Belzowski, managing director of the automotive futures group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. "By any objective measure, the auto industry bailout is an Obama success story." The Detroit Three big automakers — Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler — reported strong sales in 2015 and projections for 2016. But it’s worth remembering that the record-breaking total vehicle sales figure isn’t just for American-made cars. It includes foreign models sold in the United States, too. Of the 2.4 million cars sold so far in 2016, 71 percent were imports, according to the Wall Street Journal. David Lewis, a professor emeritus of business history at the University of Michigan, compared 2015 to the golden age of the American car industry. "Think of 1955, a record sales year, and a time in which well over 90 percent of the vehicles sold in the U.S. were manufactured by American companies," Lewis said. Even taking into account the number of foreign versus American car purchases, Clinton’s claim is reasonable because foreign car sales count as part of the "auto industry," said Clifford Winston, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. Foreign cars have been a growing part of the U.S. auto market since the 1980s. But it might not be fair to take her claim as proof of the long-term health of American manufacturers, Winston said. While the bailout resurrected struggling American auto manufacturers, it’s possible that it just stalled the companies’ eventual decline as consumers choose foreign cars instead. He also noted potential future threats from ride-sharing services and self-driving cars. "Let us not get too excited about one or even a few years of successes with this industry that has been extremely turbulent and repeatedly rescued by the government," Winston said. "All the while, the Detroit share has gone down. So that tells you something that any given year still may mask long-term issues." This is partially reflected in employment data. Employment among car dealers has in fact returned to its pre-recession high of about 1.2 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But employment in the motor vehicle and parts manufacturing sector hasn’t completely recovered. About 1.3 million people worked in this sector in the early 2000s; that figure dropped to about 620,000 at the height of the recession in 2009, and it has risen to about 920,000 in early 2016. But "for the factories that made it out of the recession, all is well," Belzowski said. U.S. vehicle production in 2015 was the eighth-largest in history, at 11.9 million. That’s high — and almost double production in 2009 — but still not quite as high as it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some industry analysts expect the good times to keep coming for the next few years, with 2016 breaking more records, according to the Detroit Free Press. "It’s a great time to be in the automobile business, and it’s particularly sweet for those who lived through the dark days of 2009 and 2010," said IHS Automotive analyst Tom Libby. Our ruling Clinton said, "We just had the best year for the auto industry in America in history." With sales figures that exceed the pre-recession high, 2015 was a great year for the auto industry, including American manufacturers. This high point should be taken with a grain of salt because it might mask long-term issues with American manufacturers, especially given foreign manufacturers’ growing market share. Clinton’s statement is nearly accurate but requires that extra bit of context, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5d3ea8b7-e3b8-41e8-b56a-b7ce4d6745cb	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-20T15:00:00	2016-05-16	['United_States']
pomt-12440	"Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/15/glenn-grothman/glenn-grothman-says-planned-parenthood-leading-abo/	On April 30, 2017, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) provoked an outcry at a town hall meeting in Neenah when pressed to explain his support for defunding the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. A woman doing the questioning warned Grothman that he shouldn’t use Planned Parenthood’s abortion services as an excuse to pull funding, because the agency is already prohibited from using federal funds to support abortion procedures. Grothman’s quick response: "Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country." He added that the group is an outspoken advocate for what he termed "controversial" services. To be sure, Planned Parenthood does more than abortions. Services include screening for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control, sex education and general health care. Indeed, in a one-year period from 2014 to 2015, 87 percent of patients visited Planned Parenthood clinics for services other than abortion, PolitiFact Wisconsin found in February 2017. Grothman’s statement about the "biggest abortion provider" was one we’ve seen in various forms from House Speaker Paul Ryan, Cardinal Seán Patrick O’Malley of Boston and National Public Radio. Does it hold up? Running the numbers There’s no complete, centralized database that tallies abortions, much less breaks that number down by providers. But there is strong indirect evidence backing Grothman’s claim. Planned Parenthood self-reports that 323,999 abortions were performed at its facilities nationwide for the year ending September 30, 2015. That represents 35 percent of the 926,200 U.S. abortions estimated for calendar year 2014, the latest year studied by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy organization whose survey-based data on abortions is widely quoted by both sides in the abortion debate. Grothman maintains 49 percent of abortions are performed by Planned Parenthood. That’s because he uses the smaller base of 664,000 abortions -- the figure reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That number is based on voluntary reporting. Here’s what we heard from two groups deeply involved in the abortion issue: -- Planned Parenthood is the largest single provider of abortion care in the United States, according to the Abortion Care Network, a national association for independent abortion providers. It’s worth noting that local providers unaffiliated with a national organization -- including freestanding clinics and private practice hospitals -- collectively do the majority of the procedures. -- The 35 percent "easily" makes Planned Parenthood "the nation's largest abortion chain," and there’s no evidence any other provider is close, according to the National Right to Life Committee. More about Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood’s abortion services grew rapidly between 2000 and 2015, rising by 127,000 procedures at a time when the total number of abortions nationwide was falling significantly. The agency operates some 660 centers across the country. About half offer abortions, according to agency spokeswoman Beth Lynk. Its facilities see patients from all 50 states, though one state, North Dakota, has no Planned Parenthood health center. The Moorhead, Minn., health center is two blocks from the state border and serves predominately North Dakota patients. A Planned Parenthood spokesperson said the agency doesn’t track the numbers on other providers and wouldn’t venture an opinion on Grothman’s claim. But Jennifer Thibodeau, a spokesperson for the Abortion Care Network summed up the general feeling among informed observers this way: "There is no other national organization that operate on the scale they do." Our rating Grothman told constituents that "Planned Parenthood is the biggest abortion provider in the country." The agency’s national network of clinics stands apart from other providers as the undisputed leader when it comes to providing abortion services. This is one of those truisms that is basically, well, True. (Editor's note, June 7, 2017: An earlier version of this item quoted Grothman as saying that Planned Parenthood is an outspoken advocate for "controversial" services such as birth control. A spokesperson for his office said on June 7, 2017 that the video, in which Grothman's voice is hard to hear at times, may have led people to that conclusion, but that Grothman does not believe birth control is a controversial service. The birth control quote had no bearing on the congressman’s statement about Planned Parenthood and its role in abortions, so the rating of True is unchanged.)

pomt-11913	NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem is "against the law."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/19/roy-moore/it-against-law-nfl-players-kneel-national-anthem-r/	Roy Moore, Alabama's Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, introduced a new dimension to the debate over NFL players’ protest by claiming that kneeling during the national anthem is illegal. "It’s against the law, you know that?" Moore said in an Oct. 16 interview with Time magazine. "It was a act of Congress that every man stand and put their hand over their heart. That’s the law." Given his controversial role as the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore’s claim caught our attention. We’ve previously looked at the history of athletes protesting the national anthem, but this is the first time we wanted to explore what the law says — and doesn’t say — on the matter. What does the law say — and not say? Moore cited Title 36, Section 301 of the U.S. Code, which designates the Star-Spangled Banner as the national anthem. It also instructs military members and veterans on how to properly comport themselves while the anthem plays, before addressing civilian etiquette. "All other persons present should face the flag and stand at attention with their right hand over the heart," the law states, "and men not in uniform, if applicable, should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart." So Moore is correct in one sense: Congress indeed passed a law dealing with decorum during the national anthem. But the etiquette is merely a suggestion, not a legal obligation. We know this because lawmakers used the word "should" — not "shall" — with regard to their patriotic guidance. The word "should" implies "usually no more than an obligation of propriety," according to the authoritative legal reference Black’s Law Dictionary. In other words, "should" does not create a legally enforceable duty. "When laws are binding they use the word ‘shall.’ Shall is non-negotiable, and not discretionary," said Catherine Ross, a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in First Amendment law. " ‘Should’ is a recommendation. That is, in the context of patriotic ceremonies, it’s what a civilian should do if they want to follow best practices." Moore’s statement may give the impression the law is binding, when in fact it’s toothless — at least with regard to non-military members. It contains no mechanism to force the average civilian to stand at attention during the national anthem, and contains no penalties for those who opt to sit or kneel. The absence of such consequences reinforces that the law is simply a protocol or ideal, as opposed to a legal mandate, said Michael Gerhardt, a professor at UNC School of Law. First Amendment protection Because the law contains no enforcement mechanism or penalty, it’s difficult to imagine a civilian who knelt for the national anthem being hauled into court. But for argument’s sake we asked legal experts how a judge would handle such a case. "In spite of whatever the law says," Gerhardt said, "there is strong Supreme Court precedent protecting people from being compelled to express a message they do not approve." Ross said two Supreme Court cases virtually ensure a court would find that the First Amendment protects the right to kneel during the national anthem. In 1943, the court ruled in West Virginia vs. Barnette that the First Amendment protects people from being forced to participate in patriotic ceremonies that offend their conscience or beliefs. In the 1989 case of Texas vs. Johnson, the court protected the the right to burn the American flag as a form of symbolic speech. "If the Constitution protects the right to burn the flag and the right not to participate in the pledge as aspects of free speech," Ross said, "it must also protect the right to kneel respectfully during the national anthem or the pledge of allegiance." Our ruling Moore said NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem is "against the law." Moore's basis is that a law on the books describes patriotic etiquette during the national anthem. But his statement gives the false impression the law is binding, when in fact it’s merely guidance that carries no penalty. Additionally, legal experts told us the First Amendment protects the right to kneel during the national anthem. We rate this False.

pomt-12251	California taxes are "among the highest in the nation."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/jul/11/travis-allen/mostly-true-californias-taxes-among-highest-nation/	In the video announcing his run for California governor, Republican Travis Allen said he wants to reduce the state’s crime rate and its high taxes. We recently fact-checked Allen’s claims on crime in the video. The Orange County state assemblyman earned a Mostly False for his statement that "crime is on the rise" in all the state’s major metros. We found he cherry-picked data from an uptick in crime in 2015 and ignored the state’s decades-long decline in crime which continued in early 2016. Given the importance of taxes in California, we also decided to examine Allen's claims on this topic. "I’ve seen our taxes increase to be among the highest in the nation," Allen said in the campaign video on June 22, 2017. "In California, we must get serious about cutting our taxes. Californians pay among the highest taxes in the entire nation." Allen makes his claim at about the 0:15 minute mark of the video above. Was Allen right? Are California’s taxes really "among the highest in the nation"? We set out on a fact check. Our research We decided to examine where California ranks in key tax categories, including income, sales and property taxes. Additionally, we looked at how California measures up in a more comprehensive category: Its overall state-local tax burden. We also spoke with several tax experts for some context on these rankings. They all said comparing tax rates is doable but messy, noting that states assess taxes in different ways. Allen’s campaign did not respond to our request for evidence to support his claim. Here’s what we found in each key tax category: Income tax California’s top tier income tax rate is the highest in the nation at 13.3 percent, according to the Tax Foundation and California Taxpayers Association. It’s the rate paid by Californians who earn more than $1 million annually. Maine had the second highest top rate at 10.15 percent, followed by Oregon’s 9.9 percent, as of Jan. 1, 2017. Several states have no income tax, including Nevada, Washington, Texas and Florida. Of course, only a fraction of Californians pay the top income tax rate, noted Annette Nellen, professor and director of the graduate tax program at San Jose State University. A recent Sacramento Bee analysis of state tax data found 61,000 households, or 0.4 percent of the state’s 16 million total, reported income of more than $1 million in 2014. "This is a very small percentage of the population," Nellen said. "Not everybody is paying that. So, if someone was to say we have really high taxes in California, sometimes that’s interpreted as everybody’s paying a really high tax when in California we also have a fairly high exemption for individuals and children which might cause some lower-income folks to not pay any California income tax at all, at least not directly." Per capita, Californians pay $1,991 annually in state income taxes, which ranks fourth highest in the country, according to the Tax Foundation. Sales tax While only a fraction pay the state’s top income tax rate, everyone who lives here or visits pays California’s highest-in-the-nation sales tax rate of 7.25 percent. Four states tie for the second-highest statewide sales tax rate, at 7 percent: Indiana, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Tennessee, according to the Tax Foundation. States with no sales tax include Oregon, Montana, New Hampshire and Delaware. When adding state and local sales taxes, California rank drops to 10th highest. This combined tax rate varies across the state. In some parts of Los Angeles County, for example, it tops 10 percent, said David Kline, a spokesman for the California Taxpayers Association. The association researches tax data and opposes what it calls unnecessary taxes. Property tax Unlike California’s income and sales tax rates, the state's average effective property tax rate is among the lowest in the nation, at 0.72 percent, or 36th among states, according to the Tax Foundation. That’s due to voter approved Proposition 13, which limited property tax increases to no more than 2 percent per year. New Jersey had the highest property tax rate at more than 2.1 percent, according to a 2016 report by the Tax Foundation. Still, Kline said, property tax in California is compounded by additional taxes, such as parcel taxes and Mello-Roos assessments, or fees charged to property owners in a specific area to pay for public improvements such as streets and parks. "Those can add hundreds or thousands of dollars every year," he added. Total tax burden In addition to ranking individual tax categories, the Tax Foundation produces a more comprehensive category it calls the State-Local Tax Burden. It measures the share of income in the state that goes to state and local taxes. California ranked sixth highest on this list at 11 percent. New Yorkers faced the highest burden at 12.7 percent, followed by Connecticut at 12.6 percent. Alaskans paid the smallest share of their income, 6.5 percent, in state and local taxes. We asked Joe Henchman, vice president of the Tax Foundation, about the accuracy of Allen’s claim that California’s taxes "are among the highest in the nation." "I think it’s a fair comment to make," Henchman said. "Unless you’re being really specific about a particular type of tax, California is usually at the high end of the states. It’s almost always in the top half of the states in terms of a tax or its burden or how much people pay. And it’s often in the Top 10." Exceptions do exist, he said, such as California’s low taxes on wine (44th highest), spirits (40th) and beer (28th), compared with other states. Nellen, the San Jose State University tax professor, agreed California’s taxes are generally high and said Allen’s claim is mostly backed up by the facts. Growth and taxes In recent years, top Democrats in California have deflected criticism about the state’s high taxes by pointing to strong employment and GDP growth. Gov. Jerry Brown, for example, has repeatedly pointed to the more than 2 million jobs California has created since he returned to office in 2011. Allen has criticized Brown’s recent signing of a 12 cent per gallon increase in the state’s gas tax. That move is expected to make California’s gas tax second highest in the nation, behind Pennsylvania’s, once it goes into effect in Nov. 1, 2017. Henchman said, for now, California’s economy has succeeded despite it’s high taxes. "Nobody moves to California because of taxes," he said. "They move in spite of the taxes, because of other positive benefits. … There’s good weather, there’s Silicon Valley, there’s great universities, there’s Hollywood, etc., etc. "Those, for a lot of people, make it worth paying the taxes, to a point," Henchman added. Our ruling Republican candidate for governor Travis Allen recently claimed California’s taxes are "among the highest in the nation." Allen’s statement is broad and needs clarification. But when looking at some of the most important tax categories, including income, sales and gasoline taxes, there’s a lot of truth to his claim. California has the highest top tier income tax and the highest state sales tax in the nation. It’s important to note that the top rate income tax is paid by only a fraction of households in the state, and that the sales tax rate drops to 10th in the nation when local and state sales taxes are examined state-by-state. Notably, it does not have one of the nation’s highest property tax rates, at 36th highest. Allen’s claim is accurate but needs this additional information. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. UPDATE: An earlier version of this fact check described California's property tax rate as 0.72 percent. We have clarified that this is the state's average effective property tax rate. Visit our Tracking the Truth series here to see all of our 2018 governor's race fact-checks.

pomt-01049	Says President Barack Obama is "not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/22/carly-fiorina/fiorina-obamafails-meet-his-own-measures-equal-pay/	President Barack Obama didn’t say much about women in his State of the Union address, but one of his few references drew a jab from former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. In his speech, Obama said "this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work." He was referring to the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would allow workers to talk among themselves about how much they are being paid. Fiorina, a California Republican who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2010, took the president to task the next morning on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. "Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required," Fiorina said during a conversation with White House adviser Valerie Jarrett. "I also think it's just a fact that laws exist on the books today, and if a woman is being discriminated against because of her gender, she should use the full extent of that law. I am struck by the fact the president hasn't really led in this regard. He's not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House." "In the White House, women do earn equal pay for equal work," Jarrett said. "The bill that’s currently before Congress would make it easier for women to find out if they are being discriminated against." From that exchange, what caught PunditFact's attention is that Obama isn't practicing what he preaches in the White House. So what do the facts say? At a baseline level, there is a gender pay gap in the White House. Each year, the president’s office publishes a list of all staff members, the jobs they hold and their pay. With a little commonsense and a bit of Googling (we now know that Brayden is an Irish boys name), we sorted the most recent list of 460 employees by gender. We found that the average female staff member made $78,767 in 2013, while the average male made $85,602. The Washington Post did its own analysis and came up with slightly different numbers, but no matter how you cut it, a difference exists. In round figures, the average woman makes about 10 percent less than the average man. (One detail: Just about all the staffers are listed as employees, but about 6 percent are on loan as it were from other agencies. They are listed as detailees and their pay is not set by the White House. It does have some impact on the numbers. For the record, we included all workers in our analysis.) So there is a pay gap. But the context of the comments made by Obama at the State of the Union, and then by Fiorina, go beyond that a pay gap exists. The suggestion is that it exists out of some level of discrimination. Put another way, women are paid less than men for doing the same job. We found no real evidence of that happening at the White House. When we matched men and women by their job titles, not only did the gap disappear, the edge went to the women. This table shows how things break down for two higher echelon titles, "assistant to the president" and "senior policy adviser." Job Title # Men Average pay # Women Average pay Assistant to the president 12 $170,141 10 $172,270 Senior policy adviser 7 $106,714 9 $107,442 In cases where the titles match completely, as with the "deputy assistant to the president and deputy counsel to the president," the salaries were identical. The three men and one woman holding those jobs in 2013 all made $158,500. Same thing with "analyst." We found 15 men and women with the title analyst all making $42,000 a year. A man and woman with the title "assistant counsel of ethics" both earning $60,000 a year. Five men and women with the title "assistant director" making $50,000 a year. Another five men and women with the title "coordinator" making $45,000 a year. But not all titles matched up so easily. The title of "deputy assistant to the president" comes with a range of add-on titles. There was a "deputy assistant to the president and deputy director of communications," and a "deputy assistant to the president and director of the White House military office." If we ignored the add-ons, we found that the average female deputy assistant made $141,562, or about $10,000 less than the average male deputy assistant who made $150,115. And within titles, we did see some pay gaps -- in both directions. A woman with the title "director of operations" made $30,000 a year more than her male counterpart. A male with the title "calligrapher" made about $9,000 a year more than a female with the same title. (There's also a chief calligrapher, in case you were wondering.) "Equal pay means equal pay for equal work and that's what we have at the White House," a White House spokesman told PunditFact. "Men and women in the White House in equivalent roles earn equivalent salaries." He added that department heads all make the same salary and over half are women. The numbers are clear. By the standard that men and women doing the same jobs should get the same pay, the Obama White House makes the grade. When we reached Fiorina’s office, we learned that her comment emerged out of a running Republican dispute with the administration over its talking points on this issue. Fiorina had something very particular in mind when she referred to Obama’s "own measures." Back in April, Obama marked Equal Pay Day by signing executive orders that imposed new rules for federal contractors. A line in the press release said, "Women still make just 77 cents on average for every dollar a man earns, and continue to face prejudice in the workplace. And that number hasn’t improved — the pay gap has stayed constant since 2002." Republicans, including Fiorina, find the 77 cents figure to be a deceptive rallying cry, precisely because it ignores that women and men tend to hold different jobs than men and those jobs tend to be lower paying. They argued that by that standard, the White House is not much better than the average employer. "When the White House talks about equal pay for women they use one set of math for themselves and one set for others," said Fiorina spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. "The president uses this statistic to compare the average pay of women in all jobs to the average pay of men in all jobs. But when applying this rhetoric to assess pay in the Obama White House, they cry foul." In that regard, Fiorina has a point. PolitiFact rated a claim from Obama Mostly False that, "Women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." The rationale: The gap isn’t all because women are paid less for doing the same work. A large part of the gap exists because women and men are doing different work. But when the claim changes even slightly, it becomes more true. In 2014, Obama said simply that Women "make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." That rated Mostly True because it removes the idea that the pay gap is solely related to discrimination. This year, Obama was careful with his wording as well, simply saying that "this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work." And all Fiorina said was Obama was not paying women equally "by his own measures." Linda Babcock is an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a leading researcher on women in the workforce. Babcock told PunditFact that the pay gap at the White House and across the country is rooted in occupational segregation. Women tend to hold positions that pay less than men. "We’ve made good progress on equal pay for equal work," Babcock said. "But that’s not fixing the whole problem. You look at any kind of organization and you will see relatively more women at the bottom and relatively more men at the top." Babcock said research has found that many factors lie behind this. She said men are more likely to have more senior, more powerful advocates for them inside organizations. Babcock also noted than when deciding whether to promote someone, managers tend to be risk averse. "We are more uncertain about women and we force them to meet a higher bar of performance before they go up to the next level," Babcock said. Our ruling Fiorina said that Obama is not paying women equally in his own White House by "his own measures." That by "his own measures" in some ways is the key to this claim, though you wouldn’t necessarily know it by just reading Fiorina’s comment. Fiorina is trying to reference past occasions when Obama said that "women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." That’s Mostly False, because the pay gap is not all about discrimination. But the framing of the discussion post-State of the Union was different. Obama said, "this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work." Fiorina followed with, "Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required," and then, Obama’s "not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House." The latest White House staffing data shows that there is a gap in average pay for men and women. But when the job titles are the same, largely so is the pay. In fact, for some job categories, women do a bit better than men. Fiorina’s dispute had to do with past rhetoric, not the issue as she framed it. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-13241	"During his 18-year Senate career, (Russ Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right. … (He) promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/19/ron-johnson/testing-ron-johnson-claim-russ-feingold-judges-and/	U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson took aim at challenger Russ Feingold in a campaign ad on the Second Amendment. In it, Johnson claimed he will protect the rights of gun owners, but Feingold won’t. "Your right to keep and bear arms, your ability to protect your family is at risk," Johnson said in the ad, which was posted online in August 2016. "Sen. Feingold promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows." Johnson, a first-term Republican from Oshkosh, is mired in a tight re-election race with Feingold, a Democrat whom Johnson ousted in 2010. While carrying a shotgun in one hand and ammo in the other, Johnson in the ad references the vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat ("One more liberal justice will flip the court") and says he has "held firm defending the Second Amendment and will continue to do so." Not so with Feingold, Johnson claims: "During his 18-year Senate career, (Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right, and he’d do it again if elected to a fourth term." That last sentence is key because it contains a specific factual assertion that Johnson uses to conclude Feingold would not protect the rights of gun owners — namely that Feingold "supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right." Johnson also says that while Feingold "promises to protect those rights," his voting record shows the opposite. But do the facts really support Johnson’s conclusion? Let’s take a look. Confirmation votes and court rulings When asked for backup, a Johnson campaign spokesman cited Feingold’s votes in the Senate to confirm the appointment of three U.S. Supreme Court justices — Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor — who dissented in major gun rights cases. In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives people an individual right to carry a gun for protection and is not merely a collective right tied to participation in a militia. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented, with Breyer writing he did not think the Second Amendment protects an absolute right to own a gun, but instead "protects militia-related, not self-defense-related, interests." (Sotomayor was not yet on the court.) Two years later in McDonald v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court effectively extended Heller. The court ruled that the Second Amendment, through the 14th Amendment, applies to states just as it does to the federal government. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented here too, as did Sotomayor. (Feingold opposed the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who cast a majority vote in support of both Heller and McDonald. The remaining Supreme Court justices who participated in those cases were appointed before Feingold became a senator in 1993, except for John Roberts, who is discussed below.) Thus, there is some truth to Johnson’s claim insofar as Feingold voted to appoint three justices who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment gives people an individual right to possess a gun. But here’s what Johnson left out of the ad: Feingold also voted to confirm judges whose decisions have strengthened gun rights. For example: • Feingold voted to confirm Chief Justice Roberts, who voted in the majority of both Heller and McDonald. • Feingold voted to confirm Wisconsin native Diane Sykes as a judge to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the 2011 case Ezell v. Chicago, Sykes authored a court decision that invalidated a city of Chicago ban on gun ranges within city limits. • Feingold voted to confirm 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Hardiman, who in 2013 said the Second Amendment should protect an individual’s right to possess a handgun outside the home. • Feingold voted in 2003 to confirm 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Carlos Bea, who earlier this year joined a ruling that found a California county’s ordinance prohibiting gun stores from within 500 feet of residential areas violated the Second Amendment. And while Feingold has said he favors mandating background checks on people buying firearms at gun shows, he also has said he was pleased with the outcome in Heller and he has explicitly expressed support for an individual’s right to own a gun. "I’ve long believed that the Second Amendment grants citizens a right to own firearms," Feingold said in 2010. Our rating In a campaign ad, Johnson said Feingold "supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right." Feingold did vote to appoint judges who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment provides for an individual right to possess a gun. But Johnson failed to mention in the ad that Feingold also voted to appoint judges who have issued rulings strengthening gun rights. And Feingold has stated clearly he supports an individual’s right to own a gun. Because Johnson’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6fe8400a-b450-425e-b3ee-c3b0daabd2b4	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-10-19T05:00:00	2016-08-09	['Russ_Feingold', 'Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution']
pomt-06291	"The American healthcare system burns 18 percent of our national GDP. Nobody else is close."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/20/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-us-spends-18-percent-i/	U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, was one of several speakers at a Sept. 21 health care forum in Washington on the future of health care in the United States. Not surprisingly, much of his speech focused on how much the nation spends on health care. The forum was organized by the nonprofit Washington-based Partnership for Quality Care, whose members, according to its website, include physician groups, health plans, employers, hospitals, consumer groups and policymakers. One point Whitehouse made caught our attention. "The American health care system burns 18 percent of our national GDP. Nobody else is close," he said. We knew our spending was high compared with other industrialized nations, but we wondered whether he got his facts right. First, we contacted Whitehous'’s spokesman, Seth Larson, to find out where the information came from. He sent us links to two websites. The first link took us to the site for the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. There, we found this statement: "Total health expenditures reached $2.5 trillion (in 2009), which translates to $8,086 per person, or 17.6 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product." The most recent comparisons are for 2009. (Gross Domestic Product, the market value of the nation’s production of goods and services, has since been revised for 2009, so the share of health care spending that year was actually 17.8 percent of the GDP, said Thomas Dail, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Either way, it still rounds to 18 percent, as Whitehouse said.) Next, we followed the second link to check how the United States’ health care spending compares with spending in other industrialized countries. The international data came from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a Paris-based organization with 34 member countries. The organization, which has an office in Washington, D.C., is funded by contributions from its member governments. Under "Frequently Asked Questions," we found a link to a spread-chart that shows annual health expenditures by country as a share of GDP. In 2009, the most recent year with complete data, the industrialized country with the next highest health expenditure per GDP is the Netherlands, at 12 percent, followed closely by France, Germany, Denmark, Canada and Sweden -- all above 11 percent. (It should be noted that many countries that spend far less on health care than the United States get better results on such measures as life expectancy, access to care and treatment of heart attacks and other health problems.) Our ruling Whitehouse said that U.S. health care spending accounts for 18 percent of the national GDP, far outstripping other countries. He got his facts right, accurately summarizing two reports based on federal government data. We rate his statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-03317	Rick Scott "invested $38 million in the Port of Jacksonville's vital Mile Point Project," which "covered missing federal funds for the project."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jul/26/republican-party-florida/republicans-greet-obama-ad-touting-lack-federal-mo/	President Barack Obama isn’t just late to the party for Florida’s ports, Republicans say. He’s taking credit for throwing it. The Republican Party of Florida, umm, "welcomed" Obama to the Jacksonville Port Authority on Thursday with a full-page ad in the Florida Times-Union talking up Gov. Rick Scott’s focus on the economy, especially the ports. "Here in Jacksonville, right where you will be speaking, Gov. Scott invested $38 million in the Port of Jacksonville's vital Mile Point Project," the ad stated. "It is a state investment that will help create good-paying jobs. And it covered missing federal funds for the project." Their attack is riddled with political irony: Obama and Scott have had major differences over transportation projects in the past (see high-speed rail), but both are fans of ports. We wanted to know if it was true that the state provided missing funds for ports that the federal government didn’t. The Mile Point project is aimed at improving access to the Jacksonville port. Right now, strong ocean cross-currents prevent the biggest cargo ships from accessing the harbor outside of a narrow window each day at high tide. "Two-thirds of the day, that cargo cannot move," said JaxPort spokeswoman Nancy Rubin. "Those are just the very largest ships, but that is becoming a significant part of the trade we’re dealing with." To fix the problem, the federal Army Corps of Engineers devised a plan that will basically remove part of a man-made wall contributing to the strong currents and reconstruct the surrounding area. By law, Congress must authorize the corps to do the project. In a gridlocked, sequester-ridden, earmark-less era, that’s no easy task. Large-scale infrastructure projects have fallen prey to an earmark ban, even though its intention was to weed out spending on unvetted, wasteful projects, said Kurt Nagle, president and CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities. "What got caught up in that were port projects that do have a clear federal role and clear national interest and have gone through multiple layers of review and analysis," he said. Congress typically approved money and permission for port projects in the Water Resources Development Act, which has not passed since 2007. In May, the Senate passed a bipartisan version of the bill that would authorize Mile Point and other projects, as well as allow for the corps to proceed with projects, under certain conditions, for which it has outside funding. (Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., voted for it; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., voted against.) Obama called on the House to pick up the Senate bill. Catch that? The Mile Point project is essentially held up by the House, led by Republicans averse to new spending, growing the deficit and tax cuts. The corps projected the cost for the Mile Point project at about $36 million, with 65 percent coming from the feds and the rest coming from local sources. Scott, eyeing a state budget surplus with no federal investment in the pipe anytime soon, pushed the Legislature to set aside $36 million for the project. The Legislature agreed. The port kicked in $500,000 and the federal Army Corps of Engineers kicked in $1.5 million to create designs for the project. (The ad credits all of that money to Scott, which isn't quite right.) But even though the port has the money from the state, it can’t spend it because Congress hasn’t moved legislation that would allow that. The state’s JaxPort investment is part of a trend under Scott not to wait for federal dollars. In 2011, he got $77 million for a deep dredging project in Miami. JaxPort also wants to deepen its channel, but the Mile Point project is a ready-to-go priority (and hundreds of millions of dollars cheaper). "We feel like we are at the finish line, we’ve got the money," Rubin said. "The authorization, to us, is pushing us over the finish line." Port of Tampa CEO and director Paul Anderson penned a June op-ed advocating for passage of the federal legislation. The Port of Tampa received about $25 million for various projects from the state in the 2013-14 budget. Our ruling Yes, Scott persuaded state leaders to put aside $36 million for the project, with the remaining $2 million coming from the port and the corps. In years past, the federal government paid most of the tab for improving a federal shipping channel. The Republicans’ ad implies Obama bears the burden for missing federal funding for Mile Point, saying Obama "took his eye off the ball." Truth be told, it’s the fault of Congress, which has final say over Army Corps port projects. A wide-ranging bill that would authorize the Mile Point project is stalled, the norm in recent years. RPOF’s ad is accurate but could use more context. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2013-07-26T16:32:41	2013-07-25	['None']
pomt-12870	"Here's the fact: The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/30/kellyanne-conway/kellyanne-conway-incorrect-worker-remittances-mexi/	White House counselor Kellyanne Conway offered several possibilities for how President Donald Trump will build a wall across the southern border, including a tax on goods crossing from Mexico to the United States. Conway went on to decry the United States’ trade deficit with Mexico during an interview with CBS’ Charlie Rose, calling "repatriation of funds" a "very big piece of President Trump’s vision for this country." "Here's the fact," Conway said on Jan. 27, 2017. "The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back." This would be more appropriately considered an alternative fact. Conway does have a point that "remittances" (as they are officially called) from individuals in the United States constitute a significant boost to the Mexican economy, and they may be of enormous importance to the individual families on the receiving end. However, they are far from the country’s No. 1 source of income. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) BBVA Bancomer, a Mexican economic forecaster, has projected that once all the data for 2016 is tallied, Mexicans will have sent $27 billion in remittances into Mexico in 2016 -- a one-year record, and an increase of more than $2 billion over 2015. (Part of the reason for the uptick, the group says, was a surge in remittances in November with Trump’s election, driven by widespread concerns that he may cut off remittances in the future.) These totals are in line with U.S. government data. However, we found at least two different types of money flows from the United States to Mexico that are bigger than remittances. Ranking first is the money spent by United States consumers and companies on good old-fashioned Mexican exports -- everything from manufactured goods to oil to agricultural products. According to federal data, the United States in 2015 imported Mexican goods totaling $295 billion. That pot of money is more than 10 times bigger than the amount of remittances. The biggest category of Mexican exports to the United States -- auto vehicles and parts -- was by itself north of $100 billion in 2015, according to the Census Bureau. In addition, foreign direct investment by the United States totaled $28 billion in 2015 -- a bit higher than the projected remittances for 2016 and clearly higher than the total of remittances for 2015, which was $24.8 billion. Foreign direct investment is defined as "investment from one country into another, normally by companies rather than governments, that involves establishing operations or acquiring tangible assets, including stakes in other businesses." Three experts in U.S.-Mexico economic ties -- Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics; Mary C. King, a Portland State University economist; and Robert A. Blecker, an American University economist -- concurred with our analysis of the data. "Remittances are important -- just far from No. 1," Blecker said. "And from a Mexican point of view, it’s a huge disappointment that remittances are so high relative to foreign direct investment and tourism, which would be much more positive sources of income. Nevertheless, they are not the biggest -- not nearly." Our ruling Conway said, "Here's the fact. The No. 1 source of income into Mexico are Mexicans working here and sending the money back." A projected $27 billion influx of cash from the United States into Mexico is nothing to sneeze at, and this money makes a real difference in the lives of many Mexicans who have relatives living and working in the United States, whether legally or illegally. However, contrary to what Conway said, remittances do not rank No. 1 on the U.S.-Mexico income flow list. Rather, U.S. purchases of Mexican goods -- to say nothing of services -- are more than 10 times the size of remittances. And remittances also trail foreign direct investment as a source of income in Mexico. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14949	"In 40 years, 23,000 chemicals came on the market and only four were regulated."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/oct/25/sheldon-whitehouse/whitehouse-has-mixed-facts-regulated-chemicals/	U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse recently joined Hasbro executives at their downtown headquarters to push a bill to regulate thousands of chemicals, including hazardous substances that pose a risk to children. From behind a blue podium that was as brightly colored and as plastic as a child’s toy, Whitehouse made this claim: "In 40 years, 23,000 chemicals came on the market and only four were regulated." This certainly sounded like the Wild West of unregulated chemicals to us: 22,996 chemicals on the market and only four run-ins with regulators? It was clear early on that our fact-checking of the statement would pivot on the definition of "regulated." Our dictionary tells us that to "regulate" is "to control or direct by a rule." Whitehouse’s go-to expert on chemicals, Richard A. Denison, a lead senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund, was at the event and provided some immediate clarification after the senator spoke. The EPA blocked four chemicals from the marketplace after the passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976. That, Denison said, was the regulation Whitehouse was talking about. So almost 23,000 other chemicals went unregulated? That didn’t line up with a 2010 report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Inspector General. Through September 2008, according to the report, EPA "regulated 1,432 chemicals by means of Consent Orders." The consent-order process, which involves negotiations with manufacturers, is quite different from the process that EPA used to block those four chemicals. But it’s a form of government regulation nevertheless — the outcome of a process in which manufacturers of a new chemical must, by rule, file a notice with the government and receive the EPA’s approval. We contacted Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson for clarification. Larson told us that Whitehouse had been "speaking off the cuff." Larson asked us to consider a somewhat similar statement made in two news releases issued to publicize the Hasbro event. "In almost 40 years," says the news release. "TSCA has restricted just five chemicals of the more than 80,000 that are in commerce — and even failed to ban asbestos." The five chemicals referenced in the release are different from the four substances that Whitehouse referred to at the Hasbro podium. The five chemicals were among 62,000 chemicals already in existence in 1976, while the four substances were among chemicals created after the law was passed, according to Denison. Our research into the restriction of "just five" substances took us right back to the more than 1,400 chemicals that OIG says EPA regulated through the consent-order process set forth in the 1976 law. The agency, according to its website, can establish conditions for safe use via a "consent order," with the manufacturer agreeing to: toxicity testing, warnings, worker protections, "restrictions" on use and releases to "water, air and land." But Denison says the orders are negotiated case by case, behind closed doors, and the terms can remain secret or are heavily redacted in the few instances they become public. Still, the 1,400 chemicals have been regulated or restricted in some way. And the EPA even refers to certain negotiated requirements as "restrictions." Denison, in a later email, referred us to a collection of comments that high-level EPA officials have made regarding the five particular chemicals Whitehouse cited in the news releases. We noticed that in each case, the EPA officials had qualified their remarks in ways that Whitehouse didn’t. However, from a broader perspective, none of this analysis undercuts Whitehouse’s basic argument that the 1976 law isn’t protecting the public and it needs an overhaul. While many companies have agreed to restrictions under EPA pressure, the overall regulatory environment is extremely lax. Regulators don’t know the toxicity of many chemicals in the marketplace. "It is important to note that almost 90 percent of pre-manufacture notices submitted to EPA complete the review process without being restricted or regulated in any way," the agency says on its website. More than 60 senators have signed on as supporters of the legislation backed by Whitehouse. Hasbro’s chief executive, Brian Goldner, says Hasbro is on a mission "to make the world a better place for children and their families, and this reform will be a victory." Our Ruling Whitehouse’s spokesman said the senator used the wrong verb at Hasbro. He asked us to test a different statement that uses a different verb and refers to different facts. We did. In both cases, we found evidence that the number of regulated or restricted chemicals was far greater than the tiny number that Whitehouse and his office referred to in their various statements. Cheryl Hogue, an assistant managing editor at Chemical & Engineering News, agrees that EPA’s regulatory authority is greatly limited by the 1976 law. But she also told us,"Every new chemical that comes on the market has to give a notice to EPA…Is that regulation?," she asked. "A lot of chemical companies would call that regulation." The 1976 law is weak, and it looks like Congress might make it tougher. But Whitehouse used the wrong verb and he mixed up the facts to make his case for change when he claimed that "only four" of 23,000 chemicals "were regulated." For these reasons, we rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Sheldon Whitehouse	None	None	None	2015-10-25T00:00:00	2015-10-14	['None']
pomt-09101	"We only have 2 percent of the oil reserves in the world, and we consume 25 percent of the world's oil on a daily basis."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/22/edward-markey/markey-says-us-consumes-25-percent-worlds-oil-desp/	The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has focused attention on the nation's energy portfolio. In an appearance on the June 20, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said, "We only have 2 percent of the oil reserves in the world, and we consume 25 percent of the world's oil on a daily basis. That is nonsustainable." We won't pass judgment on whether it's sustainable or not, since that's a matter of opinion. But we did think it would be worth checking Markey's facts, especially since this comparison has become something of a Democratic talking point. President Barack Obama said something similar in his Oval Office address to the nation on June 15, 2010. The president's phrasing differed slightly, saying that the United States consumes "more than 20 percent" of the world’s oil, rather than "25 percent." We looked to the Energy Information Administration -- the nonpartisan Energy Department office that publishes the most complete set of statistics on U.S. energy use -- to confirm these numbers. For U.S. oil reserves, we turned to EIA's "World Liquid Fuels Analysis to 2030." A table in this report showed that, as of Jan. 1, 2009, the U.S. has 21.3 billion barrels of oil reserves. That's about 1.6 percent of the world total which, rounded up, would be 2 percent, as Markey said. (For the curious, that ranks the U.S. 12th in the world in reserves, with the top five being, in order, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iran, Iraq and Kuwait.) As for the second claim, about U.S. consumption, we turned to EIA's country-by-country summaries of petroleum consumption. The most recent figures, available for 2008, are preliminary. These show that the U.S. consumed 19,498,000 barrels per day, compared to 85,462,000 for the world as a whole -- or 22.8 percent. That's a bit lower than Markey's 25 percent. But we'll add that in 2006 and 2007, the U.S. share of world consumption was 24 percent, which is just a hair under the number Markey cited. All told, Markey would have been better off using Obama's formulation -- that the U.S. consumes "more than 20 percent" of the world's oil. But he's still close. We rate his statement Mostly True.

Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican running for president, made a comment suggesting child molestation wasn’t as terrible as gay relations. We were skeptical, in part because we’ve found no factual bases for similar web posts attempting to link Cruz to especially provocative statements. Pants on Fire ratings were bestowed in March and April 2015 to two outlandish posts about Cruz.. Now comes this May 2015 Facebook post showing a smiling Cruz next to Josh Duggar, who resigned from the conservative Family Research Council May 21, 2015. Duggar's resignation came after reports surfaced that at the age of 14, he had allegedly sexually assaulted four female siblings in his large family, plus an additional female victim. According to U.S. News and World Report, Duggar’s family confirmed the allegations via an apology on their Facebook page, downplaying the multiple incidents as "very bad mistakes." For those of us bereft o' cable TV: Josh Duggar is among the children in the Duggar family of Arkansas who are stars of the TLC show "19 Kids and Counting." The Facebook post says that the day after Duggar quit the council, Cruz said: "While there may have been an age difference, Josh Duggar’s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do to each other." We spotted the meme, posted the evening of May 22, 2015, on a Facebook page titled Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off. It had been shared more than 4,600 times in its first four days online: SOURCE: Facebook post, May 22, 2015 We asked Cruz aides about the quotation and didn’t hear back. Separately, our search of the Nexis news database yielded no sign of Cruz commenting on the allegations about Duggar, which surfaced in recent reporting by In Touch magazine, which cited local police reports. Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, has been adamantly opposed to the U.S. Supreme Court possibly legalizing same-sex marriage. At an April 2015 event in Wisconsin, he said advocates of traditional marriage should ''fall to our knees and pray'' against such a decision, the New York Times reported. Its April 26, 2015, news story said too, though, that Cruz had earlier indicated at a New York event that he would be comfortable if his young daughter were gay. On May 24, 2015, the debunkists at Snopes.com found nothing to the May 2015 Facebook post supposedly quoting Cruz. Snopes.com added: "Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off is an entertainment Facebook group that frequently mocks conservative politicians and pundits with fake quotes, and their disclaimer states that their ‘page is for entertainment purposes’ and ‘is NOT meant to be taken seriously.’" Maybe this is the right time to point out the same Facebook group on May 25, 2015, posted a made-up quotation attributed to PolitiFact: "Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off is the most accurate source for news, not only on Facebook, but pretty much everywhere."

pomt-11654	On expanding offshore oil drilling	full flop	/florida/statements/2018/jan/10/rick-scott/gov-rick-scotts-full-flop-oil-drilling/	Gov. Rick Scott met with a member of President Donald Trump’s administration and struck a deal to remove Florida from a list of states proposed for more offshore oil drilling.

Zinke highlighted Scott’s role in the deal. "Florida is obviously unique," Zinke said. "For Floridians, we are not drilling off the coast of Florida, and clearly the governor has expressed that it's important." Scott’s statement led to claims that Scott had flip-flopped on offshore oil drilling. We decided to measure whether Scott had shifted his position on our Flip-O-Meter. Scott’s announcement came as the term-limited Republican governor is poised to potentially run against Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, an opponent of an expansion of drilling. Scott’s spokespersons argued that Scott made no flip. "Since 2010, Governor Scott has consistently said that we must ensure that Florida’s beaches are protected and has made it clear that protecting the environment is his top priority," Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland said. We found that Scott clearly campaigned in 2010 on expanding oil drilling. Today, he opposes an expansion. Scott favored drilling in 2010 PolitiFact Florida has tracked Scott’s stance on oil drilling since his first campaign in 2010. On his campaign website then, Scott called for more drilling offshore but said that the state’s beaches must be protected. "As we explore the expansion of domestic drilling in the U.S. we must ensure that we have sound policies in place that ensure the companies drilling are doing so in an environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards. ... Rick supports expansion of nuclear power, use of alternative fuels and off-shore drilling." A Scott campaign spokeswoman told PolitiFact Florida in May 2010 that his campaign had initially posted his position before the Deepwater Horizon explosion in April and later updated it to add the phrase about the environment and safety standards. During that summer, Scott reiterated his call for safe offshore drilling when meeting with Panhandle fishermen. Scott said drilling wouldn’t happen in the "foreseeable future. ...We are not going to drill now. ...It's not safe. It doesn't make any sense." Scott never took significant steps toward his promise to explore expansion of drilling in a safe, environmentally sound way. We rated his promise broken in 2013. Trump’s plan to open up drilling In April 2017, Trump signed an executive order that aimed to expand offshore drilling. Scott was initially mum. Days later, Scott told the Tampa Bay Times that he hadn’t seen the proposal and declined to comment. The state Department of Environmental Protection sent an Aug. 17 letter to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management raising concerns about the effects of oil and gas activities on the environment, but did not expressly oppose the drilling proposal. On Jan. 4, Zinke announced a proposal to open up more coastal areas in Florida, California and the Atlantic to drilling. Scott expressed his voice quickly on Twitter Jan. 4, saying that he opposed drilling: "Based on media reports, it is likely that the Department of the Interior will consider Florida as a potential state for offshore oil drilling – which is something I oppose in Florida. I have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration. My top priority is to ensure that Florida's natural resources are protected, which is why I proposed $1.7 billion for the environment in this year's budget." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Over the next few days, Scott had multiple meetings with Trump administration officials. On Jan. 9, when asked what caused the Trump administration to change its position on Florida drilling, Zinke said, "The governor." Scott praised the Trump administration for removing Florida from consideration. Oil and gas exploration doesn’t seem to be entirely off the table, though. Zinke said seismic testing still would be allowed, but no new drilling. Susan Glickman, Florida Director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said the only reason to allow seismic testing is to find places to drill. Our ruling During his first campaign for governor in 2010, Scott called for drilling offshore. After the Deepwater Horizon explosion, he added language to his campaign website to state that he wanted drilling done in an "environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards." During his first term, Scott took no meaningful steps to expand drilling. But when Trump’s administration proposed an expansion of offshore drilling Jan. 4, Scott said he opposed the idea and sought a meeting with Zinke. That rejection sounds different from his stance when he first ran for governor in 2010 and he was open to drilling. We give Scott a Full Flop.

pomt-08306	"The Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/30/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-claims-mitch-mcconnell-says/	With the looming possibility of Democrats losing their grip on the House and possibly even the Senate in Tuesday's midterm elections, President Barack Obama took some time in his weekly address on Oct. 30, 2010, to talk about the need to work in a bipartisan way to solve the country's most pressing issues, such as the weak economy. But Obama said a couple recent comments from Republican leaders weren't a good harbinger. "Whatever the outcome on Tuesday, we need to come together to help put people who are still looking for jobs back to work," Obama said. "On these issues -- issues that will determine our success or failure in this new century -- I believe it’s the fundamental responsibility of all who hold elective office to seek out common ground," Obama said. "It may not always be easy to find agreement; at times we’ll have legitimate philosophical differences. And it may not always be the best politics. But it is the right thing to do for our country. "That’s why I found the recent comments by the top two Republican in Congress so troubling. The Republican leader of the House actually said that "this is not the time for compromise." And the Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one." We're fact-checking the last part, the claim that "the Republican leader of the Senate said his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one." It's based on a comment Sen. Mitch McConnelll made in an interview with the National Journal's Major Garrett on Oct. 29, 2010: "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." So McConnelll said it. But we think some further context is in order. McConnell said he had been studying the history of presidents who suffered big defeats in midterm elections in Congress, but then won re-election in two years anyway. McConnelll said he doesn't want Republicans to repeat the same mistakes that allowed that to happen. "After 1994, the public had the impression we Republicans overpromised and underdelivered," McConnell said. "We suffered from some degree of hubris and acted as if the president was irrelevant and we would roll over him. By the summer of 1995, he was already on the way to being re-elected, and we were hanging on for our lives." McConnell said Republicans need to treat the midterm elections as "the first step in retaking the government." It was in that context that McConnell said, "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." Garrett asked if that meant "endless, or at least frequent, confrontation with the president?" Said McConnell, "If President Obama does a Clintonian backflip, if he’s willing to meet us halfway on some of the biggest issues, it’s not inappropriate for us to do business with him." In other words, in the very same interview, McConnell said that he'd be willing to work with Obama if Obama is "willing to meet us halfway." That's called compromise. And that sounds very much in the spirit of Obama's call to "seek out common ground." The other comment Obama referred to came from House Leader John Boeher in a radio interview with Sean Hannity on Oct. 27, 2010. It was made in the context of the health care bill, in response to retiring Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) saying it wouldn't be a good idea to repeal the bill. "This is not a time for compromise," Boehner said. "...We're going to do everything -- and I mean everything -- we can do, to kill it, stop it, slow it down." We think Obama's comment leaves the impression Boehner's "not a time for compromise" statement was more general in nature -- as opposed to being specifically targeted at the health care bill. As for McConnell's comment "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president," that sounds an awful lot like Obama's summation that "his main goal after this election is simply to win the next one." But while McConnell said it, Obama left out an important detail -- that McConnell also said in the same interview that he is willing to meet the president halfway. That leads us to a ruling of Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-10-30T16:05:42	2010-10-30	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-02138	Says the Club for Growth tries to defeat Republicans, and that its president called Nancy Pelosi "the person I respect the most in Washington."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/07/defending-main-street/did-club-growth-president-say-he-respected-nancy-p/	An Idaho congressional race has become a key battleground in the face-off between establishment and anti-establishment Republicans. In an attempt to tar its rival with an ideology-bending linkage, Defending Main Street is trying to tie Bryan Smith, the Tea Party challenger to GOP Rep. Mike Simpson, to — of all people — House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California. "Meet the DC insider launching misleading attacks about Mike Simpson," the ad says. Then, the ad plays a clip of Club for Growth president Chris Chocola saying, "The person I respect the most in Washington might surprise you: It’s Nancy Pelosi." The narrator continues: "His group spends more money trying to defeat Republicans than defeating Democrats. … And while personal injury attorney Bryan Smith and his financial backers help Pelosi, Mike Simpson is Nancy Pelosi’s worst nightmare." (Not to be outdone, Smith’s supporters are also trying to tie Simpson to Pelosi. We looked at that ad separately.) In this fact-check, we’ll review Club for Growth’s record in recent campaigns and see whether the ad accurately portrays what Chocola said about Pelosi. What is the Club for Growth? The Club for Growth has supported candidates who are focused on lowering taxes and easing regulations. The club has frequently ruffled feathers within the Republican establishment by endorsing primary challengers to GOP incumbents and by pushing Republicans further to the right in order to head off intra-party competition. For example, in Indiana’s 2012 primary, the club supported Richard Mourdock over longtime Republican Sen. Richard Lugar (Mourdock won the primary but lost the general election). Last year, the club strongly backed the government shutdown to defund Obamacare. In this campaign cycle, they’ve pumped more than $100,000 into Idaho to help Smith oust Simpson in the primary, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the ad, Defending Main Street says the Club for Growth spends more money fighting Republicans than Democrats. They have spent quite a bit — $11.5 million since 2011— running ads against Republicans. That’s about 55 percent of $21 million they’ve spent in the last four years. But the money spent against Republicans wasn’t in general elections to help Democrats, it was in primaries where Republicans had conservative challengers. They’ve also spent more than $5 million attacking Democrats and about $4.5 million running ads supporting Republicans. So it’s true that the group has challenged Republicans, but typically by boosting one Republican against another in GOP primaries. Respecting Pelosi And how about that quote from Club for Growth president Chris Chocola, a former GOP congressman from Indiana? The clip is taken from an American Enterprise Institute discussion called "Tea party vs. establishment: Who is helping the right, and who is hurting it?" (Chocola was debating Steve LaTourette, who helped create Defending Main Street.) Chocola was defending Club for Growth’s support for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and like-minded conservatives in the House and Senate who last year pushed Congress to defund Obamacare even at the risk of a government shutdown. Here’s the transcript of Chocola’s remarks:: "The person I respect the most in Washington my surprise you: It’s Nancy Pelosi. The reason I respect Nancy Pelosi is because she had a historic job. She was the first woman speaker of the United States House of Representatives. And she woke up for 40 years saying, ‘I want to pass nationalized health care.’ And she got the job that she could get it done, and during the process she realized that public opinion polls never get close to 50 percent approval. ... "But she got it done and she knew it would jeopardize her historic job. She could lose her job over doing what she believed. But she found a way to do it. Because she believed in it so strongly, it’s the law today. Is there a Republican you can think of that is willing to risk their job to do what they think is right? Is there a policy that they’re willing to fight on? … If you don’t like the tactic of Ted Cruz going to the floor and doing a filibuster, what’s yours? What’s your tactic besides surrender? Is it better fight, make a point and lose, or just surrender, making no point?’" The full context makes it clear that what Chocola admired about Pelosi was her tactical ability -- her singleminded willingness to pursue her goals in the face of great risks -- and not the substance of what she was fighting for. Chocola didn’t support Pelosi’s policies or Obamacare, but instead wished Republicans would follow her example and take firm stances to pass their priorities. And that’s a very different impression than one would get from the ad. The moderator of the debate, AEI fellow and Washington Examiner columnist Tim Carney, told PolitiFact that he never took Chocola’s statement to mean he had love for Pelosi. "Main Street's ad struck me as totally misleading," Carney said. "Chocola was clearly saying Republicans need to be as dedicated to their conservative beliefs as Pelosi is to her liberal beliefs. The Main Street ad clearly implies Chocola is a buddy of Pelosi, which was not at all the nature of his remarks." Our ruling There’s some truth to the claim that the Club for Growth tries to defeat Republicans. One of the club’s key strategies has been to put its money in Republican primaries in order to support the most aggressively conservative candidates. This means taking on some Republicans — but also supporting others. Meanwhile, Chocola clearly said what the ad said he did, but the ad takes that remark wildly out of context. Chocola was expressing admiration for Pelosi’s Machiavellianism, not supporting her political agenda. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07685	"Hitler didn't want unions. Stalin didn't want unions. Mubarak didn't want independent unions. These autocrats in history don't want independent unions."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/08/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-hitler-stalin-and-mubarek-a/	Ohio's Sherrod Brown took the floor of the U.S. Senate last week to recall some history he considered pertinent, given current events involving public worker unions in Ohio and Wisconsin. "I look back at history," he said, "and some of the worst governments we've ever had, you know one of the first things they ever did? They went after the trade unions. Hitler didn't want unions. Stalin didn't want unions. (Former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak didn't want independent unions. These autocrats in history don't want independent unions." Brown hastened to say that he was not drawing an analogy. "I'm not comparing what's happening to the workers in Madison or in Columbus to Hitler and Stalin," he said. "But I am saying that history teaches us that unions are a very positive force in society that creates a middle class, and it protects our freedom." Recent history also teaches us that nuance and context are lost when someone drops the H-bomb. Mentioning Hitler in political discussion obscures any other point. The Washington website Politico.com quickly posted a partial video of Brown's speech that carried the headline, "Sherrod Brown compares Republicans to Hitler." Chris Bond, press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, released video of part of the speech, with the headline: "Sherrod Brown invokes Hitler in his latest political attack." E-mailed and tweeted video links started making the rounds. Brown's office noted that some of the links and postings did not include the full context of his remarks, but that should not have come as a surprise. Brown apologized the next day. "I should not have mentioned the hostility of tyrants like Hitler to unions," he said. "I don't want my mistake to distract from the critical debate in Ohio, and I apologize for it." But fact-checking is our business. Even accepting that Brown did not intend a comparison, PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine the accuracy of his history. We thought it was important, in particular, because of postings by some bloggers and commenters claiming Hitler did not oppose unions -- that he wrote favorably about them in "Mein Kampf," that he proclaimed May Day a workers' holiday, and that he even started a union. We looked at contemporary and historical accounts and a transcript of the Nuremberg Trials, and we consulted Kenneth F. Ledford, associate professor of history and law at Case Western Reserve University. He is a social historian of modern Germany and an authority on German legal and labor history. Citations from "Mein Kampf" come from the chapter "The Problem of the Trade Unions" -- "which is really pretty incoherent," Ledford said. "It is not an endorsement of trade unions but a call to subordinate the message of class solidarity to one of national solidarity" and "a call for the quiescence of labor to favor heavy industry," he said. In saluting unions, as in naming the Nazis the National Socialist German Workers' Party, Hitler "was using words he knew had appeal. It was as if they had been focus-grouped. Those were hot-button words that had resonance in the revolutionary period after 1918. "The reality is, the (Nazi) party could not make inroads into the organized, unionized, working-class electorate in Germany," Ledford said. May Day was first celebrated as an international day of labor in New York in the 1880s. Hitler made it an official paid holiday, not just a negotiated day off, on May 1, 1933 -- and used it to rally for his regime and industrialization. William Shirer (The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich), who was there, called it "an elaborate piece of trickery." The next day, on May 2, 1933, unions were dissolved, their assets were confiscated, their offices were occupied and their leaders were arrested. Hitler then outlawed strikes, abolished collective bargaining and established the German Labor Front, a corrupt party organization. "It wasn't even a sham labor union," Ledford said. In Russia, he noted, "Stalin didn't have to eliminate unions -- Lenin already had." And Stalin's first Five-Year Plan converted labor groups into oppressive mechanisms for increasing worker productivity. Mubarak does not belong in the same category as Hitler and Stalin. But his government did routinely suppress worker protests by force. The government-run Egyptian Trade Union Federation was given a monopoly on labor organization in 1957 by the Trade Union Act, which prohibits union freedoms. Brown’s statement about tyrants and unions may have been distracting and ill-advised given the current standoffs, but it also is historically accurate. We rate Brown’s statement as True.

pomt-03296	Says the State Department spent $630,000 to get 2 million Facebook "Likes."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/aug/01/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-tax-dollars-went-down-drain-b/	Money can’t buy you love, as the Beatles sang, but money can buy you "like." Sen. Rob Portman thinks the price can be more than it’s worth. The Ohio Republican made the point in his monthly statement for July "highlighting Washington’s wasteful spending during a time of record debt and deficits." This one, decrying "tax dollars down the drain," said the U.S. State Department "spent $630,000 to obtain 2 million Facebook 'Likes'." "With Washington running budget deficits of more than $1 trillion – or $10,000 per household – the Administration should not be wasting taxpayer dollars on frivolous items such as attempting to buy Facebook fans," Portman said. That clicked with PolitiFact Ohio. We wanted to know more. Portman said his source was a report by the U.S. State Department’s inspector general. Completed in May, the 57-page report was one in a periodic series examining policy implementation, resource management and management controls in the State Department's Bureau of International Information Programs. The report says the bureau launched digital diplomacy campaigns in 2011 and 2012 that started or expanded online activities in six foreign languages, and started or expanded English-language Facebook pages, Twitter feeds and blogs aimed at foreign audiences. "The bureau spent about $630,000 on the two campaigns," the inspector general found, "and succeeded in increasing the fans of the English Facebook pages from about 100,000 to more than 2 million for each page. Advertising also helped increase interest in the foreign language pages; by March 2013, they ranged from 68,000 to more than 450,000 fans. "Many in the bureau criticize the advertising campaigns as 'buying fans' who may have once clicked on an ad or 'liked' a photo but have no real interest in the topic and have never engaged further," the report said. The inspector general found that the number of Facebook users who actually engaged with each page was relatively small, with only about 2 percent "liking," sharing or commenting on any item within the previous week. And the report said that the bureau's target audience is older and more influential than the people likely to spend hours engaging on the social site. The campaign became less effective in 2012, the report said, when Facebook changed its mechanics, making the bureau's fan pages less prominent to users who did not engage with them. But engaging with fans might not be an improvement over trying to increase the number of them, the inspector general said: "The bureau could reduce spending and increase strategic impact by focusing its advertising not on raising overall fan numbers or general engagement statistics but on accomplishing specific PD [public diplomacy] goals." State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki was asked about the report during a daily briefing with reporters on July 3. She said that the Bureau of International Information Programs had cut its spending on Facebook ads, from $315,000 a year to $36,000 a year. "Spending on online advertising has significantly decreased," she said. "It’s now at $2,500 a month, and that still allows us to reach out and communicate with a wide range of individuals living overseas. And on June 27th, IIP also submitted to OIG (Office of the Inspector General) its strategy for implementing the report’s recommendations, and also provided an update on those that have already been met. IIP will implement the majority of OIG’s recommendations on or before the start of fiscal year 2014." It is important to know that the inspector general's stinging report found that the Facebook campaign was being questioned in the bureau by November 2012, and that spending has been cut by almost 90 percent. But Portman's statement about the State Department spending for Facebook "Likes" is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.

pomt-07349	"Two million federal workers negotiate zippo, zero. There is no collective bargaining for federal employees."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/10/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-federal-workers-have-zippo-ze/	Equity among workers is one of Republican Gov. John Kasich’s most consistent arguments in favor of Ohio’s new collective bargaining law. The law, Senate Bill 5, will bring Ohio’s public workers closer in line with private sector workers, who, on average, pay more for health care benefits and have weaker pensions, Kasich repeatedly has said. Now the governor is weaving collective bargaining for federal workers – or lack thereof – into his support for the law. Even though SB 5 restricts collective bargaining for the state’s 360,000 public workers, they would still be better off than federal workers, Kasich recently told a Youngstown radio show. "Two million federal workers negotiate zippo, zero," Kasich told radio host Dan Rivers on April 26 when discussing SB 5. "There is no collective bargaining for federal employees." Kasich has been among the most vocal supporters of SB 5, and likely will continue to fill that role if the law heads toward a voter referendum this fall. Considering his influence and the widespread interest in SB 5, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s claim about collective bargaining for federal workers. We did not have to dig deep to get started. Our colleagues at PolitiFact checked a similar statement Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made in late February, when his state, like Ohio, was in the middle of a controversial effort to pass legislation to limit collective bargaining for public workers. Walker told NBC’s Meet the Press host David Gregory that "most federal employees do not have collective bargaining for benefits, nor for pay." PolitiFact gave Walker’s claim a True rating. So how does Kasich’s similar claim hold up? Federal workers generally cannot collectively bargain pay and benefits, but they can negotiate working conditions, according to the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which administers the labor-management relations program for more than 1 million federal workers. "Employees also have the right to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees," the FLRA’s program guide reads. There are about 1.6 million non-postal federal workers. Of those, about 1.1 million are represented by more than 90 labor organizations. Some workers in agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission can negotiate wages. Others in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and other departments do not engage in collective bargaining. For the most part, however, federal workers only can negotiate working conditions, said Sarah Whittle Spooner, FLRA counsel for regulatory and external affairs. The right to negotiate working conditions is significant, said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. (PolitiFact also interviewed Bronfenbrenner while checking Gov. Walker’s claim. We interviewed her separately.) Bronfenbrenner pointed to a recent union election among the Transportation Security Administration’s 43,000 workers. They had three options: either of two unions vying to represent them or no union at all. More than 16,000 of the workers voted in favor of a union representation and about 3,000 voted for neither union. Because the vote between the two unions was so close, there will be a runoff election May 23 to June 21. "Would they have organized a union if they didn’t have the right to bargain?" Bronfenbrenner asked. "They wouldn’t have gone through all this if there wasn’t something at the end of the tunnel." So what does it mean for federal workers who can negotiate working conditions? It means they can negotiate discipline policies, hours of work, procedures for performance evaluations, safety, procedures for layoffs and more, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union, with about 625,000 members from about 75 federal agencies. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols acknowledged federal workers do have some ability to bargain collectively. "The fact is most federal workers cannot collectively bargain for pay or benefits and the governor’s point is that under Senate Bill 5, Ohio’s public employees will have more collective bargaining rights than most federal employees," Nichols said. So where does Kasich land on the Truth-O-Meter? It would be easy to rate Kasich’s statement False. Federal workers may have limited collective bargaining powers. But that isn't "zippo" and "zero." But the governor also is known to shoot from the hip, and ruling an off-the-cuff statement as False without looking at his underlying meaning would amount to a game of gotcha -- a game PolitiFact doesn’t play. Kasich long has advocated reigning in collective bargaining, arguing that schools and governments needed better ability to control labor costs. But he has not called for it’s elimination. Changes approved in SB 5 would reduce the number of topics subject to union negotiations, ban public workers from striking, prohibit employers from paying more than 85 percent of workers’ health insurance costs, and base pay raises on performance rather than length of service. But public workers in Ohio would continue to have more collective bargaining powers than most federal workers, Kasich’s underlying point. That some federal workers can bargain over working conditions, rather than having "zero" collective bargaining ability, is a critical fact, though, that could give a listener a different impression. We rate Kasich’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11064	Says Donald Trump's executive order "doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/22/tammy-baldwin/trumps-executive-order-doesnt-address-2000-separat/	On June 21, 2018, the day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order on the separation of children from their parents at the border, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin tried to poke holes in it. The Wisconsin Democrat is running for re-election in November 2018. Leah Vukmir and Kevin Nicholson are seeking the Republican nomination to run against her. Baldwin, interviewed on "Late Night with Seth Meyers," claimed Trump’s order "doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families." In some respects, this is a fluid situation. So let’s set out what was known when Baldwin made her statement. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc The order Families attempting to enter the United States without permission had been separated in the past, but immigration officials did so as an exception and not a rule. That changed in April 2018, when U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings. Government agents charged undocumented people with a crime and sent them directly to detention centers. Any children were sent to be cared for in separate facilities. According to the latest reports, the government was holding over 2,300 minors under the age of 12. After an international outcry, Trump reversed himself and signed the executive order to end the practice of separating families. (Vukmir also shifted her position on separating families at the border, earning a Half Flip on our Flip-O-Meter.) The Trump order reiterates that the administration’s policy is to "rigorously enforce our immigration laws." It says in part: It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources … The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, upon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law ….Heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, make available to the Secretary, for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry, any facilities that are appropriate for such purposes. The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores v. Sessions, CV 85-4544 ("Flores settlement"), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings. All our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. So, to the second part of Baldwin’s statement, the order does call for continuing to detain families -- though together, rather than separating parents from their children. But her use of the word "jailing" goes too far. The families, while kept in custody in some type of facility, would not be incarcerated in jails. The children already separated As for the 2,300 children already separated, PolitiFact National said it was not clear how or if the policy change might ultimately affect them. Initially, on the day of order, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said there would be no special effort from the Trump administration to reunite migrant families separated at the border. But later the same day, the department said the spokesperson had misspoken about the order. In a statement, the department said "it is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter," but that "reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of" unaccompanied alien children "and the administration is working towards that for those UACs currently in HHS custody." In any case, the order itself does not address the 2,300 children. Moreover, Reyna Torres Mendivil, Mexico's consul general in San Antonio, told National Public Radio that reunification would be hampered by the U.S. separation process, which keeps parents in federal custody while moving children into facilities controlled by the Department of Health and Human Services. "The U.S. authorities create different files for the children than for the parents, and it's very difficult to follow up on those cases," Torres said. And CNN noted that separated children are in facilities or foster homes spread across states far from the U.S.-Mexico border, including Michigan, New York, South Carolina and more. The White House referred us to a spokeswoman for Health and Human Services, but we didn’t get a reply. Our rating Baldwin says Trump's executive order "doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families." The thrust of Baldwin’s statement is correct. Federal officials in charge of reunification said after the order they "are awaiting further guidance" on how to proceed. But in fact the order does not address reunifying the 2,300 children with their parents, which is seen as a complicated process. The order also says, as Baldwin claims, that families entering the country without permission will continue to be detained — together, rather than parents and children being separated. But while the families would be in custody, at various facilities, Baldwin overreaches in saying the families would be put in jails. Baldwin’s statement is accurate, but needs clarification — our definition of Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2018-06-22T17:51:22	2018-06-21	['None']
pomt-03382	Obamacare "will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/jul/09/chain-email/illegal-immigrants-are-covered-under-health-care-l/	There are no graveyards for ridiculous, oft-debunked chain emails. A lengthy, widespread email keeps resurfacing with dire warnings about Obamacare as determined by Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. "Please for the sake of many good people, please... pass this on," the email begs. "We all need to be informed." Unfortunately, the email is riddled with errors, starting with the fact that is referring to an initial 2009 health care proposal that never became law. Still, because it has the subject line "Obama Care Outrage," we thought people might confuse it with the health care law on the books. In that context, and given all the talk about potential immigration reform, one line jumped out: "The bill will provide insurance to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally," the email states. Make no mistake, this line is wrong in the context of the 2009 law (Pants on Fire! wrong, in fact), and wrong in the context of the health care bill President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. Let us explain. The Affordable Care Act contains an individual mandate that requires individuals to purchase health insurance. It allows U.S. citizens and legal residents to purchase insurance on health insurance exchanges, often receiving tax credits. But none of it applies to people who are here illegally. They don’t have to follow the mandate because they shouldn’t be here. They remain ineligible for regular Medicaid coverage, just as they are ineligible for food stamps. They cannot obtain coverage through state-based health insurance exchanges (thus, they are also ineligible for tax credits to offset the cost of getting that coverage). Now, certain low-income illegal immigrants are eligible for emergency Medicaid coverage, including childbirth and surgery. And federal law requires hospitals not to turn away individuals for emergency treatment, even if they are uninsured (or undocumented), according to the National Immigration Law Center. But those policies predate the Affordable Care Act. "They don’t get health insurance, which is coverage, which is different than a hospital getting reimbursed for Medicaid," said Laura Goodhue, executive director of Florida Chain, a consumer health advocacy group. The Affordable Care Act does provide some benefits for certain legal non-U.S. citizens. We repeat: Legal. Immigrants who are in the country legally are subject to the mandate and are eligible to shop on the exchanges. Thanks to the Supreme Court and Florida legislators, certain poor, legal noncitizens have it a little easier in Florida than the state's most impoverished citizens. The law includes a special rule (page 108) allowing them to get tax credits to purchase health insurance on an exchange if they (a) do not qualify for Medicaid because they have not been here for the required five years and (b) earn at or below the poverty line. Meanwhile, about 1 million of Florida’s poorest citizens will continue not to have affordable access to health insurance. They are not eligible to receive tax credits for the exchanges, and Florida leaders did not expand Medicaid coverage to include them during the 2013 legislative session. Goodhue calls it a "black hole" of coverage. Republican Gov. Jan Brewer had noticed a similar scenario playing out in Arizona if its leaders did not expand Medicaid, saying, "For poor Arizonans below 100 percent of the federal poverty level, only legal immigrants, but not citizens, would be eligible for subsidies." Our ruling The chain email says that Obamacare provides insurance "to all non-U.S. residents, even if they are here illegally." It’s actually citing a 2009 proposal that didn’t pass, but that doesn’t really matter. The email’s wrong either way. The Affordable Care Act does nothing to provide health insurance to anyone living in the United States illegally. It does offer some assistance to legal non-U.S. citizens, which by the way is different than a non-U.S. resident as the email claims. (A non-U.S. resident could be living in Mexico, France or even Mars). We rate this claim Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2013-07-09T16:36:53	2013-07-07	['United_States']
pomt-13536	"They were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/29/donald-trump/trump-says-they-were-going-build-wall-06-no-enviro/	Donald Trump may have confused people recently about whether he supports mass deportation. But there’s one thing he’s been consistent about: building a wall along the southern border. And having Mexico pay for it. In an interview aired Aug. 23, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked the Republican presidential nominee how long it would take to build the wall, from start to finish. "Almost immediately," Trump answered. "Now if you would believe it, you know, they were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements. Can you believe it? Okay. Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad or…" We were curious about wall plans from a decade ago and whether environmental impact statements hindered its construction, as Trump’s statements suggest. Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for more information. But immigration experts referred us to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, signed into law by President George W. Bush. Secure Fence Act The act called for the construction 700 miles of additional fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. It also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to deter illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. Bush said the new law would make borders more secure and hailed it as "an important step toward immigration reform." The act also required the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. Environmental impact statements So there was a 2006 law that sought to increase fencing around the border. But it didn’t face hurdles from environmental impact statements. That’s because the REAL ID Act of 2005, passed by Congress, gave the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to "waive all legal requirements" that may get in the way of construction of barriers and roads along the border. In 2008, then Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, used his authority to waive environmental reviews. "Congress and the American public have been adamant that they want and expect border security," said Chertoff in an April 2008 New York Times report. "We’re serious about delivering it, and these waivers will enable important security projects to keep moving forward." The secretary also waived requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act, according to Melinda Taylor, who directs an energy and environmental law center at the University of Texas and who co-wrote a paper on the environmental impacts of the border wall between Texas and Mexico. The waivers were not without controversy. "The environment was certainly a major issue that opponents of the wall brought up," said Cassie Williams, spokesperson for Federation for American Immigration Reform, which favors reduced immigration. But DHS did not need an environmental impact statement because of the Congress-approved waiver, Williams said. In July 2008, DHS released an Environmental Stewardship Plan, analyzing potential environmental impacts of the fence and plans to mitigate them. While there were environmental concerns related to fence construction, "it’s simply false that environmental requirements or issues impeded wall construction," said Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. Gilman believes it’s appropriate to call the fencing a wall because it’s clear that it was supposed to keep people out. Segments built are generally 18-feet high, she said. Rebecca Hamlin, assistant professor of legal studies at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said environmental concerns were raised at the border, but believes money is what has halted additional construction, not environmental impact statements. A 2009 U.S. Government Accountability Office report noted that for fiscal years 2006 through 2009, the Secure Border Initiative program -- designed to secure borders and curb illegal immigration -- received about $3.6 billion. About $2.4 billion of that amount was allocated to complete about 670 miles of vehicle and pedestrian fencing along the roughly 2,000-mile border. That same report found that pedestrian fencing accounted for 140 of the miles Customs and Border Protection had completed by Oct. 31, 2008, averaging $3.9 million a mile. Vehicle fencing costs averaged $1 million a mile. "The per-mile costs to build the fencing varied considerably because of the type of fencing, topography, materials used, land acquisition costs, and labor costs, among other things," the 2009 report said. Our ruling Trump said, "They were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. And they couldn't get environmental impact statements." The Secure Fence Act of 2006 called for the construction of an additional 700 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. While there were environmental concerns related to the construction, the Secretary of Homeland Security waived required environmental reviews in order to proceed with construction. Trump’s statement suggests a wall or barrier was not built due to inability to get environmental impact statements. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10493	"The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/08/moveon/mccain-often-absent-on-childrens-issues/	The left-leaning advocacy group MoveOn.org has targeted Sen. John McCain in an e-mail list of "10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't)." The e-mail goes after him on issues from domestic policy to foreign policy to personal attributes. It urges recipients to forward the email to "your friends, family and co-workers." Item five addresses children's issues. "The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill." It's true that McCain had the worst score — 10 percent — in the Senate from the Children's Defense Fund for 2007. But it's important to note that McCain's score was so low because he missed eight of 10 votes that the fund evaluates. On the two issues remaining, McCain voted for one (raising the minimum wage) and against one (expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program, called SCHIP). For the record, Sen. Barack Obama scored 60 percent, missing four of the critical 10 votes and siding with the group on the six votes he cast. Sen. Hillary Clinton scored 70 percent, missing three votes and agreeing with the group on the seven votes she cast. MoveOn is correct that McCain voted against the children's health bill and defended President Bush's veto of the program. McCain, though, said he voted against the bill because it didn't contain adequate provisions for paying for the expansion. "The American people have rebelled against out-of-control spending. If they can find a legitimate way to pay for it, I would consider it," he said. So McCain may have scored better on the Children's Defense Fund scorecard if he had been there for more of the votes. (Though McCain's history with the group isn't that great, either. In 2006, his score was 10 percent and in 2005 it was 22 percent.) But MoveOn omits the caveat that his vote against SCHIP was based on spending concerns. But these are minor points, and not enough to notch down the Truth-O-Meter too much. We find MoveOn's statement about McCain's rating and his stance on the children's health bill to be True.	None	MoveOn.org	None	None	None	2008-04-08T00:00:00	2008-04-05	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-07517	"A report in Navy Times said that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have thought about attempting suicide."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/08/tim-ryan/series-errors-thwarts-rep-tim-ryans-accuracy-milit/	A March 16 House Armed Services Committee hearing on the war in Afghanistan put the spotlight on a widely documented increase in military suicides. During questioning of General David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and Michele Flournoy, undersecretary of defense for policy, Rep. Tim Ryan cited figures for military personnel who have contemplated taking their own lives "From '05 to '09, we've had 1,100 soldiers commit suicide, one every 36 hours. A report in Navy Times said that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have thought about attempting suicide," Ryan said at the hearing. PolitiFact Ohio checked the first part of his quote in a separate item and rated it True. This item will just check his assertion that 7.3 percent of personnel in the Army, Navy and Marines have contemplated suicide. We started by trying to verify the existence of the Navy Times report that Ryan mentioned, which was supposed to indicate that 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marines have contemplated suicide. When we couldn’t find it among Navy Times articles archived in the Lexis-Nexis database, we contacted editors at Navy Times. They confirmed that the publication never reported such a statistic. The closest thing we found was a December 2009 article on attempted suicides in the military during 2008. It cites a Defense Department survey that found the Navy had a 2.8 percent attempted suicide rate that year, the Army had a 2 percent rate, the Marine Corps had a 2.3 percent rate and the Air Force had a rate of 1.6 percent. It’s important to note, though, that these numbers represent service members who actually tried to kill themselves, not those who thought about suicide, as Ryan said. But Ryan’s statistic, it turns out, evolved from this December 2009 article via a circuitous series of bloopers. First, instead of consulting the original article or the military report from which it drew its information, Ryan got his information from a student-researched blog entry on a website operated by "Project Censored." That blog item said: "According to the Navy Times, 7.3 percent of Army, Navy and Marine soldiers reported in a survey that they had attempted suicide at one point." The "Project Censored" author used an article from "The World Socialist Web Site" as his main source, and committed a math gaffe in attempting to summarize the article. Instead of finding a combined average for suicide attempts in those three service branches, the student added the percentages together to produce an erroneously high 7.3 percent figure. The total is slightly off from the sum of the Navy Times numbers because the Socialist website incorrectly listed the Navy’s suicide attempt rate as 3 percent instead of 2.8 percent. Finally, Ryan added in his own mistake to the mix by claiming the figure applied to suicidal thoughts instead of suicide attempts. "Congressman Ryan unfortunately misstated the statistics," Ryan spokesman Erick Sanchez acknowledged in an email. Sanchez sent us the original government report that contains the statistics reported by Navy Times. It also contains data on suicidal thoughts by members of the U.S. military. That report said that in 2008, almost 5 percent of Defense Department personnel said they’d seriously considered suicide. The Air Force (3.1 percent) and Coast Guard (2.8 percent) had lower rates of suicidal thoughts than the other service branches, which were all around the 5 percent mark. Although the rate of suicidal thoughts had not increased since 2005, the report found that "all DoD services reported at least a doubling in rates of attempting suicide from 2005 to 2008." It cited an overall military rate of 2.2 percent for attempted suicides. So where does that leave us on the Truth-O-Meter? Through a series of goofs and misrepresentations, data about actual attempted suicides among military personnel became a number cited as the percentage of those who had contemplated suicide. The numbers Ryan cited didn’t come directly from the military. Instead, he relied on material from a blog article that used faulty mathematics to come up with an erroneous percentage. The series of errors took data from a military report on a ridiculous course to create an inaccurate statement. On the Truth-O-Meter, that kind of a claim rates as Pants on Fire.

pomt-08345	Tells David Cicilline, "94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/28/john-loughlin/house-candidate-loughlin-claims-94-percent-carbon-/	We all know about the theory of climate change, the idea that the earth is gradually warming because of pollution. Whenever the weather turns particularly hot or cold, we joke about it, often in supportive or derisive terms depending on our opinion on the issue. Unlike some other Republicans who dismiss global warming, John Loughlin, who is running for Congress in the 1st District, has acknowledged that the climate is changing. However, he said during a September press conference, "I think the data is unclear as to the extent of man-caused climate change. When you look at the total percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, a good number of them, in fact, the vast majority of them, are naturally occurring." He made a similar statement Oct. 19 during a WPRI/Providence Journal debate when challenged on the topic by his Democratic rival, David Cicilline. "I'm not a scientist but I did work for NASA and when I was at NASA we had a scientist who I actually did some of the press release work for by the name of Dr. James Hansen at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Dr. Hansen released a peer-reviewed paper in the '70s that talked about global cooling. And then it's only later that he's kind of gotten a conversion to global warming." He went on to tell Cicilline, "I'm saying really the earth is warming, but it's not conclusively caused by man. It's not conclusive. I mean 94 percent of the carbon emissions which you so want to get rid of are caused by nature." When people talk about carbon emissions, they are mostly talking about carbon dioxide, the gas we exhale and the gas plants need to grow. Unfortunately, when levels in the air become too high, it traps heat coming from the sun as part of the so-called "greenhouse effect." (Other gases such as methane and ozone also play a role, as do tiny particles known as aerosols.) The warmer air melts polar caps, raises sea levels and shifts ecosystems toward the poles. Plants and animals that can't adapt risk extinction. Loughlin's 94-percent figure sounds very authoritative and specific. So we emailed Loughlin's campaign on Oct. 21, and called his spokeswoman a day later, to ask for the source. They have not responded. Meanwhile, we emailed a copy of Loughlin's debate comment to Hansen. "I never had any global cooling paper or talk or comment," he wrote back to us. "The change of carbon dioxide, the increase year to year is entirely human-made. There is an up-and-down flux caused by vegetation growing (sucking carbon dioxide from the air) and decaying in the winter (releasing carbon dioxide), which is large -- this fluctuation is natural and does not alter the annual mean increase due to humans. He is speaking nonsense." So Hansen is saying that 0 percent of the increase in climate-changing carbon dioxide emissions is coming from nature, not the 94 percent claimed by Loughlin. We still wondered where Loughlin might have gotten his 94-percent figure. So we contacted William F. Ruddiman, author of a widely used climate textbook who is at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He agreed with Hansen, saying that nature sends a lot of carbon in and out of the atmosphere every year and the sources can be pinpointed because fossil-fuel carbon has a slightly different composition than the carbon that is constantly recycled by nature. Before the industrial revolution, the atmosphere had roughly 600 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to Ruddiman. Above-ground vegetation contains about 610 billion tons of carbon and the surface oceans contain about 1,000 billion tons. (There's another 1,550 billion tons or so hidden in the soil and more in the deep ocean, but that doesn't circulate fast enough to play a big role in changes over decades or centuries.) Each year, the atmosphere and ocean exchange about 75 billion tons; another 100 billion tons go back and forth between the air and the vegetation. "In those exchanges, the carbon is just moving back and forth in nature and in equal numbers, so there is no net gain to the atmosphere," Ruddiman said. Now add in the pollution generated by humans. "I think what humans are doing now is something like 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide per year," said Ruddiman. That amount is small compared with the amount shuttled back and forth between the air, ocean and vegetation, and perhaps half of that gets pulled out of the air. So we did some math. When there's 175 billion tons going into the air from natural sources along with 30 billion tons of pollution (for a total of 205 billion tons), that's 85 percent from natural sources. The only problem: the 175 billion tons comes back out every year, so when critics say humans are having only a small impact on the process, they are misunderstanding -- or misstating -- the process, Ruddiman said. "The amount of carbon dioxide humans are putting into the atmosphere is smaller but it's not balanced, and so it builds up over time and it causes a sizable net gain," Ruddiman explained. "It may be 10 billion tons a year but much of it builds up year after year after year," he said, and persists in the atmosphere, trapping heat like a chemical blanket. Scientists who have used a variety of techniques to track earth's changing climate over hundreds of thousands of years have found data that show carbon dioxide levels during that period never grew faster than 30 parts per million per 1,000 years. Yet the level has risen by that amount in just the last 17 years, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the international organization widely regarded by the scientific community as a leading authority on the topic. The result is the warmer temperatures and melting icecaps widely documented around the globe. And what about volcanoes? People think of them as sending lots of carbon dioxide in the air. It turns out that eruptions are a drop in the bucket, generating 0.2 billion tons annually, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. We also asked Ruddiman about the concept of global cooling, which critics also focus on. The fact is, in the 1970s, geologists were saying earth was coming out of a warm period and destined for another ice age. Core samples taken from the ocean floor combined with other data had allowed them to track the timing of past ice ages as changes in the earth's orbit exposed the planet to varying amounts of sunlight. But even as scientists were tracking those cycles, which extend over thousands of years, other researchers in the '70s were warning that a carbon dioxide build-up was going to disrupt that cycle and overwhelm the natural cooling trend. "I remember thinking that probably in one thousand to two thousand years, at most, we would see snow start accumulating in the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere," Ruddiman said. "That was reasonable from what we knew from ice age cycles. What very few of us were aware of was the buildup of carbon dioxide. Most of us are geologists, not geochemists," he said, explaining that by the 1980s the problem had become obvious. "The same people who said, 'If nature remains in control we're going into a glaciation in the next 1,000 or 2,000 years' turned around and said, 'Yeah, but nature's not in control. Humans are intervening much faster than nature can do the job and so we're going into a warmer time,' " Ruddiman recalled. "It's been made to sound like scientists are flip-flopping, but it's just the natural evolution of science," he said. "You broaden your point of view as you gain information that changes your conclusions. And that's what happened." Ultimately, the Loughlin campaign did not provide any evidence that nature is responsible for the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is the key problem stoking the fears of global warming. And the NASA scientist he mentioned told us Loughlin's comments were "nonsense." There's plenty of room to debate aspects of climate change, such as the best way to prevent climate-related problems, how much money should be spent on prevention, and whether it's worth the investment if other countries aren't willing to seriously limit their carbon emissions. But Loughlin's suggestion that nature is largely responsible for the looming problem is wrong. We rate his claim as False.	None	John Loughlin	None	None	None	2010-10-28T00:01:00	2010-10-19	['None']
pomt-02524	The "U.S. has the highest unintended pregnancy rate of any Western industrialized country."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/10/cecile-richards/united-states-and-canada-together-lead-industriali/	Asked about differences among Americans on abortion rights, Cecile Richards suggested this country leads in a dubious way. Texas Monthly editor-in-chief Jake Silverstein asked Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America whose mother, Ann, served as governor of Texas: "It’s often said that abortion is an issue on which there’s no room for compromise; there are two sides that fundamentally disagree, and there’s just no coming together. Do you think that’s true?" Richards replied: "Where we see enormous common ground—maybe not among politicians but among people—is that folks want women to have access to birth control; they want young people to have access to sex education that helps them prevent becoming pregnant before they are ready to be parents. "Frankly," Richards continued, "it’s an outrage that the U.S. has the highest unintended pregnancy rate of any Western industrialized country. So that, I think, is where there is enormous common ground, and we’ve demonstrated that when women have access to family planning services and can choose the family planning that works for them, we can reduce teen pregnancy, we can reduce unintended pregnancy, and we can reduce the abortion rate." Silverstein told us the bulk of the interview took place Dec. 6, 2013, with excerpts debuting in the magazine’s February 2014 edition and online. So, does the U.S. have the highest rate of unintended pregnancies among Western industrialized countries? A word: The United Nations says online that it has no established convention for identifying "developed" and "developing" countries or areas, but in common practice, Japan, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Europe are considered developed regions or areas. Guttmacher Institute research By email, Justine Sessions, a Planned Parenthood aide, offered as the basis of Richards’ claim a December 2013 "fact sheet" from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and and abortion rights. It states: "The U.S. unintended pregnancy rate is significantly higher than the rate in many other developed countries." According to the sheet, 51-plus percent of U.S. pregnancies in 2008--or 3.4 million of 6.6 million--were unintended, which the sheet defines as mistimed (31 percent) or unwanted (20 percent). That percentage was reached by institute researchers Lawrence Finer and Mia Zolna based on U.S. government data and the institute’s Abortion Patient Survey, according to a Dec. 19, 2013, Guttmacher press release. "Although many unintended pregnancies are accepted or even welcomed," the release said, "40% end in abortion." The rate of unintended pregnancies — that is, factoring in population — is another statistic, and it’s the one Richards referred to. According to the Guttmacher fact sheet, there were 54 unintended U.S. pregnancies in 2008 for every 1,000 women aged 15-44. "In other words," the sheet says, "about 5% of reproductive-age women have an unintended pregnancy each year." The sheet’s reference to unintended pregnancies in the U.S. and other developed countries was footnoted to a December 2010 research article, published in the journal Studies in Family Planning, on global levels of unintended pregnancy as analyzed by Susheela Singh, Guttmacher’s vice president for research, and two colleagues. But that article, emailed to us by Guttmacher spokeswoman Rebecca Wind, didn’t break down unintended pregnancy rates country by country. This lack of detail made us wonder how the researchers concluded that the U.S. rate significantly exceeds the rates in other Western industrialized nations. Charting unintended pregnancy rates by region Instead, the article presented a chart comparing the prevalence of unintended pregnancies by regions of the world, which the researchers said they estimated using nationally representative and small-scale surveys of 80 countries. "Of the 208 million pregnancies that occurred in 2008, we estimate that 41 percent were unintended," the authors wrote. That was up from 38 percent from an estimate in 1995. Unintended pregnancies were defined as "being comprised of unplanned births, induced abortions and miscarriages." The researches concluded that 48 percent of the 7.2 million pregnancies in 2008 in North America, in this analysis meaning only Canada and the United States, were unintended. As noted, the authors separately said 51 percent of the U.S. pregnancies that year were unintended. Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest unintended pregnancy rate in the report, at 58 percent. But both areas are not developed and industrialized, at least per the U.N.’s characterizations. Other world regions saw fewer occurrences of unintended pregnancy: Europe (44 percent), Africa (39 percent) and Asia (38 percent). By email, Wind said there are no Western industrialized countries in most of the regions with more unintended pregnancies than the U.S., with the exception of Eastern Europe. She noted, too, that the U.S. rate of unintended pregnancy in 2008 was 54 per 1,000 women aged 15-44, "well above" the 48 per 1,000 in Eastern Europe. Given that Richards spoke of the rate of unintended pregnancies, here is the 2010 study’s breakdown of such rates by region: North America (48 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44); Latin America and the Caribbean (72); Europe (38); Asia, not including Japan (49); and Africa (86). Country by country data almost non-existent Guttmacher researcher Gilda Sedgh, asked about unintended pregnancy rates for individual developed countries, told us by email: "Data on unintended pregnancy rates in developed countries are not systematically collected." Referring to the institute’s latest number-crunching, Sedgh added that researchers have preliminarily estimated that in Europe in 2012, there were 43 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44, while in North America there were 51 per 1,000. In the end, we did not identify on-point sources of information on unintended pregnancy rates in specific countries. Wind, the institute spokeswoman, said the absence of country-specific data in the published study doesn’t mean that such data always isn’t available. "Some developed countries publish unplanned birth data, some publish abortion data, and some publish both," Wind emailed. "Because not all countries publish those data, we do our analysis at the regional level. What is true is that there are no published country-specific data that directly address that claim. However, based on our research, we are confident that the US unintended pregnancy rate is higher than that of most other developed countries." At Wind’s suggestion, we reached out to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, which oversees the National Survey of Family Growth. By email, an unidentified spokesperson pointed us to a July 24, 2012, research article published in National Health Statistics Reports. The article, drawing on interviews of 12,279 U.S. women aged 15-44, estimated that 37 percent of domestic births occur due to unintended pregnancies; the researchers did not develop an independent estimate of the prevalence of unintended pregnancies or make comparisons to other countries, though it referenced Guttmacher research in stating that about half of U.S. pregnancies are unintended. Separately, James Trussel, a Princeton University professor of economics and public affairs who co-authored a January 2008 Contraception editorial on reducing unintended pregnancies, told us by email that statistics "do not exist for most countries. Even in the" United Kingdom, "we have estimates only for Edinburgh. That said, the percentage of pregnancies that is unintended is very high in the U.S. (and probably the highest in any Western industrialized society)." Our ruling Richards said the U.S. "has the highest unintended pregnancy rate of any Western industrialized country." She did not offer nor did we find a breakdown of unintended pregnancy rates for individual Western industrialized nations, evidently because none exist. This gap leaves us with the Guttmacher institute’s conclusion that in 2008, Canada and the U.S., combined, had more unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44 than every region except Asia (not including Japan), Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. None of these regions with higher rates are commonly considered developed and industrialized. We rate Richards’ claim, which lacked this clarification, as Mostly True.

pomt-01925	"In 31 states, decent child care costs more than college tuition."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-31-states-decent-child-care-cost/	President Barack Obama recently headlined a White House Summit on Working Families. During his address, he made a striking -- and for families with young kids, rather terrifying -- claim about how much child care costs. "In most parts of the country, it costs thousands of dollars a year," Obama said in the June 23, 2014, speech. "In fact, in 31 states, decent childcare costs more than in-state college tuition. In 31 states -- in more than half the states." Really? It costs more than college? We decided to take a look. We tracked down the source of the claim -- a 2013 report by Child Care Aware of America, which describes itself as the "nation’s leading voice for child care." After surveying child care providers in all 50 states, the report concludes that "in 2012, in 31 states and the District of Columbia, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care was higher than a year’s tuition and fees at a four-year public college." Among the 50 states, the costs for infant care in center-based care ranged from $5,467 in Alabama to $16,430 in Massachusetts. Tuition and fees ranged from $4,278 in Wyoming to $14,576 in New Hampshire. That seems pretty close to what Obama said. (We’re not going to quibble over the definition of "decent" -- while it’s a subjective term, "decent" seems roughly equivalent to "average," which is how the study reported its figures.) Still, Obama’s claim oversimplifies the issue a bit. It’s worth noting some clarifying language in the report --"for an infant in center-based care" -- that is absent from Obama’s statement. This is actually the highest-cost example of the four cases the report looked at. If you look at the cost for a 4-year-old in center-based care -- rather than an infant -- it costs more than in-state college tuition and fees in 19 states. That’s 39 percent fewer states compared with statistics for infant care. (Generally, care for infants is more intensive, so costs tend to go down as children get older.) The report also looked at costs for home-based care, which is often a less expensive option for parents. For infants, the cost of home-based care is higher than college costs in 14 states. That’s a 55 percent reduction in states compared to Obama’s 31. And for 4-year-olds, the cost of home-based care is higher than college in 10 states. That’s a 68 percent reduction in states compared to Obama’s 31. So Obama chose the most dramatic number of the four presented by the report -- a bit of cherry-picking. Using infant care in centers "as a comparison for the costs of college could be considered cherry-picking," said Stephen Wood, a research analyst for Child Care Aware of America. But he added that her group's study put emphasis on that comparison because it involved "the most in-demand form of early childhood education (infants in centers) and the most in-demand form of post-secondary education (four-year public colleges)." It’s also worth noting that Obama’s claim doesn’t factor in tax credits and federal assistance for child care. For instance, according to the child care group’s study, "about 2.6 million children received federal subsidies through one of several funding sources including the Child Care and Development Block Grant, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Social Services Block Grant. Additional public funding that supports early care/education is allocated for programs such as child welfare initiatives and special education." In addition, the report says, "parents and businesses can take advantage of tax credits for supporting child care, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, and Dependent Care Assistance Programs." All of these would reduce the cost of child care for many families. Of course, there are also tax credits and federal grants on the college side of the equation, and it’s possible the benefits for college are bigger than those for child care. Still, since we don’t know the impact of discounts either for child care or college costs, it adds another layer of uncertainty into Obama’s seemingly crisp summary. Our ruling Obama said, "In 31 states, decent child care costs more than college tuition." He’s chosen a statistic that originated in a wide-ranging survey of child care costs (albeit one published by an advocacy group). However, Obama has cherry-picked the most dramatic statistic of four presented in the report, allowing him to say 31 states, rather than as few as 10. He also ignores uncertainty about how federal aid and tax credits would affect the comparison. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-07278	The Providence teacher contract "is one of the longest in the country."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/24/angel-taveras/providence-mayor-taveras-says-citys-teacher-union-/	Bigger isn't necessarily better. Quality is sometimes better than quantity. Providence Mayor Angel Taveras alluded to that when the city's teachers' contract came up for discussion during the May 15 edition of WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers" program, which was taped May 12. Host Tim White was asking about problems in the School Department and the difficulty of getting rid of bad teachers, citing the case of one woman who was put on paid leave after being accused of drinking on the job and taking students home with her to do her housework. "From your perspective," White asked, "is the villain here an overly restrictive union contract that makes it hard to terminate teachers, or is it bad management that fails to cross the T’s and dot the I’s and get things done?" "I think it's both," the mayor said. "I think it's both in the sense that the contract is very restrictive. It's one of the longest in the country and needs to be changed. That's one thing. But the second thing about it is that we also need to follow through. And some of these things, in terms of following through, they're not easy. But they're necessary. … And that's not just in terminations, but overall." We were intrigued by his statement that the teachers' contract is "one of the longest in the country." We asked our usual question -- "Is that true?" -- but it also prompted us to ask, "Who would keep track of something like that?" So we contacted Taveras' office. Taveras spokesman David Ortiz said the mayor misspoke. He meant to say that it's one of the longest in Rhode Island, not the nation. Asked why the contract length matters, Ortiz said in a statement: "The contract is complex and contains many constraints on management." "For example, the contract has language that now creates the shortest teacher work year in the state, the shortest school instructional day permitted under state regulations, zero mandatory professional development hours built into baseline salary, a requirement that teachers be paid at $25 per hour for professional development, and 20 sick days that are allowed to accrue if unused," said Ortiz. "The mayor's position is that the constraints built into the current contract are a barrier to education reform." Ortiz sent us to the website of the Rhode Island Association of School Committees, which has copies of contracts from 32 local school districts. He opened them in a Microsoft Word file and did a word count -- not a precise gauge, but close enough. We did the same and came to the same conclusion he did. Providence's teachers' contract is the second-longest in the database, at 31,888 words, or about 90 pages(depending on the formatting). Only the Central Falls contract is longer, at 33,014 words, or roughly 97 pages. To put that in context, the contracts in Warwick, Exeter-West Greenwich and West Warwick are in the 25,000- to 30,000-word range. New Shoreham and Little Compton have the shortest agreements -- both under 9,000 words or under 30 pages or so. But is it possible that Providence's is one of the longest nationwide? We found a PDF file of the latest contract covering the Los Angeles school system. It runs 349 pages -- nearly four times longer than Providence's 90 or so pages. Boston's is more than 250 pages. Robert Walsh, executive director of the National Education Association of Rhode Island, which does not represent Providence teachers, said the contracts in Worcester and Springfield are well over a hundred pages. Having a long contract "is an interesting but possibly meaningless distinction," said Walsh, because a contract may simply carry over a lot of provisions that are no longer relevant or may act like a personnel handbook. And a contract "that is longer and clearer may be easier to maintain than one that is short and pithy." But Timothy Duffy, executive director of the Rhode Island Association of School Committees, had a different view. "The bigger the contract, the bigger the opportunity for a grievance to be filed," Duffy said. As both sides keep adding to an agreement, "there are probably provisions that conflict with one another" and there are probably more cases in which the school committee has given up some of its management rights to the union. In any event, it seems clear that Providence's teachers' contract is far from one of the longest in the nation, and Taveras' office was quick to say that the mayor misspoke. If he had said it was one of the longest in Rhode Island, we would give him a True. But his statement was far more sweeping than that, so we rule his statement False.

pomt-08046	"I represent the fourth-poorest (congressional) district" in the nation.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/03/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-says-her-district-fourth-poorest/	Poverty seems to be as much a part of Milwaukee as wind chills in winter. In 2009, the city’s poverty rate was fourth-highest among the nation’s big cities, according to census figures released in September 2010. But in an interview published Dec. 15, 2010, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a four-term Democrat who represents the city, told a Milwaukee weekly newspaper she represents the fourth-poorest congressional district in the country. Could that also be true? Moore made the comment in response to a question from the Shepherd Express about whether there was a rift between congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama: "I’m a congressional Democrat and I don’t have any rift with President Obama at all," Moore said. "I think that he is operating in an entirely different arena than I’m dealing in. I represent my constituents in the Fourth Congressional District. I’m looking out admittedly for much more narrow interests. I represent the fourth-poorest district (in the nation)." While the Fourth Congressional District encompasses Milwaukee, it also covers a middle-class swath of Milwaukee County that includes West Allis and Cudahy. Is it really the fourth-poorest district in the nation? Moore spokesman, David Frey, gave us two replies when we asked for evidence to back up Moore’s statement. Initially, Frey said Moore based her comment on a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article about the census figures released in September. They showed 27 percent of Milwaukee residents lived below the federal poverty level in 2009. The headline on that story called Milwaukee the nation’s fourth-poorest city. However, the first two paragraphs of the article, and a chart that appeared with it, made it clear Milwaukee was the fourth-poorest among big cities -- those with populations above 250,000. Frey later said Moore misspoke in the Shepherd Express interview, and had meant to say she represents America’s fourth-poorest city, not its fourth-poorest congressional district. Frey said Moore has called Milwaukee the nation’s fourth-poorest city a number of times. That explanation doesn’t quite stack up, either. As noted, the city ranked fourth among large cities, behind Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo. Among all cities covered by the census data -- the comparison Frey said Moore was making -- Milwaukee ranked 46th in poverty. As for the 2009 poverty rates among the nation’s 435 congressional districts, Moore’s Milwaukee-based district -- at 25.6 percent -- ranked 18th. The highest rate was 38 percent, in the New York City congressional district that includes the Bronx. That district is represented by Democrat Jose Serrano. It’s daunting to describe how devastating poverty is in Milwaukee; this item is not aimed at downplaying the city’s ranking. But exaggerating it doesn’t help, either. Milwaukee Ald. Michael Murphy recently claimed the income disparity between the city and suburban Mequon is the highest in the country; and former acting mayor Marvin Pratt, claimed that black male unemployment in Milwaukee is above 50 percent. We found both assertions False. Moore also overstates the case. Her spokesman said Moore meant to say Milwaukee is the nation’s fourth-poorest city, not that her district is the nation’s fourth-poorest congressional district. But even that ranking is correct only when considering the nation’s largest cities. We rate Moore’s statement False.	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2011-01-03T09:00:00	2010-12-15	['None']
pomt-00570	Since Republicans took over after the 2010 election, "the graduation rate in Wisconsin has gone from 86 percent to 88 percent. The black graduation rate has gone from 60 percent to 65 percent. The Latino graduation rate has gone from 65 percent to 71 percent."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/10/dale-kooyenga/dale-kooyenga-says-graduation-rates-have-risen-rep/	Ever since Act 10 passed in 2011, Democrats have argued Republican policies "gutted" public education in Wisconsin. After all, the measure included a cut of $792 million in state aid for schools. Now, state Rep. Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield) says the party’s actions have improved educational outcomes in the state. Kooyenga went on conservative radio host Vicki McKenna’s Madison show on May 22, 2015, broadcast on WIBA. He had this to say about education and the debate over the 2015-’17 budget. "If you look at what we've done -- Republicans in Wisconsin -- you know this whole education debate over the last four months, five months. It's all been about inputs, inputs, inputs. Money, money, money, money, money," Kooyenga said. "We should focus on outputs. And here's where we're at in education in Wisconsin. "Five years ago, when Republicans had taken over, the graduation rate in Wisconsin has gone from 86 percent to 88 percent. The black graduation rate has gone from 60 percent to 65 percent. The Latino graduation rate has gone from 65 percent to 71 percent." Gov. Scott Walker made a similar claim in 2014 when he said: "graduation and third-grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office." When we checked that claim in April 2014, we rated it Mostly True. Both numbers had gone up some, though the trend pre-dated Walker. What’s more, the claim was pretty much a numbers one -- there was no direct claim by Walker that his policies made the difference. That’s where Kooyenga’s claim differs. Did the numbers Kooyenga cited all rise? And are GOP policies responsible? The numbers According to reports by the state Department of Public Instruction, graduation rates have continued to increase. Here is a look at what the numbers show: 2009-’10 2010-’11 2011-’12 2012-’13 Statewide 85.7% 87% 87.5% 88% Black 60.5% 63.8% 62.7% 64.8% Latino 69% 72% 74.3% 74.3% Kooyenga hit the mark on the statewide numbers and the number for black students, but was a little low on the increase for Latino students. He had noted a slightly lower increase in the graduation rate, from 65 percent to 71 percent. "The main premise remains the same," said Rachel Geary, a legislative assistant for Kooyenga. "The grad rate significantly increased closing the gap between minorities and the rest of the state." But what about the assertion that Republican policies are to thank? GOP credit A look at longer-term graduation trends -- and whether the rise predates the arrival of Republican control in Madison in 2011 -- is tricky. Just as Republicans took over, state officials switched the way graduation rates are measured from an old methodology that compared how many students graduated from a freshman class. Individual students, who may transfer in and out of a school, are not tracked, which can muddy the numbers. The new methodology uses a more accurate model that tracks individual students. The calculation was standardized across the country starting in the 2009-’10 school year, so new numbers cannot be directly compared to ones from the earlier system. When we looked back at the trend in graduation rates, the data showed the statewide graduation rate in Wisconsin has been on the rise -- about half a percentage point each year. When we asked Kooyenga for evidence of Republican's influence upon the rise in graduation rates, he acknowledged "many factors, including dozens outside of public policy, have an impact on these metrics." Experts say factors that influence how kids do in school include socioeconomic status, school type and location, and parental involvement. "However, Act 10 was the most significant change to education policy in this state and noticeable improvement in outcomes has been evident every year since enactment," Kooyenga said. "Superintendents have told us that Act 10 has freed up time and resources negotiating contracts, and instead allowed them to innovate and redeploy assets to better achieve their educational objectives." Act 10 reformed collective bargaining and lessened the power of unions for public employees. The bill also included a massive cut to state aid to schools. We rated a claim that the $792 million decrease in funding was the largest in state history True in February 2012. Walker and the GOP argue that districts have used the tools from Act 10 to offset the cuts, like eliminating or altering post-retirement benefits. The controversial budget bill went into effect in 2011, and it's tough to say when the effects of the bills really reached schools. When the bill passed, about two-thirds of schools had already negotiated teaching contracts for the upcoming year. Others have since taken advantage of the flexibility allowed by the law. What if you used 2012-’13 as a better baseline for a post-Act 10 comparison? Was there a significant difference in graduation rates? Not really. Between the 2011-’12 and 2012-’13 school years, statewide graduation rates went up half a percentage point. The percentage of black students who graduated went up by two percentage points. And the Latino rate went unchanged. The last cohort we have data for graduated at the end of the 2012-’13 school year. Likewise, there was a small increase between those years, following the trend. Our rating Kooyenga said graduation rates in the state increased thanks to actions by Republicans, including the passage of Act 10. The numbers did rise, but the trend existed before the GOP took over. What’s more, experts say many other factors are at work and the passage of Act 10 wasn’t followed by significant changes. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Dale Kooyenga	None	None	None	2015-06-10T14:26:02	2015-05-22	['Wisconsin', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06457	"We saw the president of the United States engage American troops in a fourth conflict in a foreign land. This is historic."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/19/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-four-simultaneous-military-d/	During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Michele Bachmann noted what she suggested was a landmark moment in American foreign policy. "We saw the president of the United States engage American troops in a fourth conflict in a foreign land. This is historic." Currently, the U.S. has active military deployments of varying types in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and central Africa. The last mission -- which could involve boots on the ground in Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- was announced just days before the debate by President Barack Obama. According to the White House, this latest mission involves "approximately 100" combat-equipped U.S. forces to aid ongoing efforts by African nations to counter a long-running battle with the Lord's Resistance Army, a guerilla group infamous for killing families and forcibly conscripting the remaining children as soldiers. We wondered whether Bachmann was correct that four simultaneous U.S. deployments represented a significant landmark for the use of U.S. forces abroad. So we turned to a report compiled by the Congressional Research Service, "Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798-2006." Because of the start and end date of the document’s data, we don’t have full information on deployments through 2011. But there are more than enough instances throughout recent U.S. history to demonstrate that four deployments is not a high-water mark. We found a few periods prior to 1990 in which the number of separate overseas deployments came close to reaching four -- including 1899, 1912, 1916 and 1919 -- but in each case we took a more cautious path because we couldn’t be 100 percent sure that the specific dates for those deployments overlapped. But beginning in 1993, we found that it was almost always the default that U.S. troops were actively deployed in at least four separate locations. We won’t overwhelm you with a torrent of dates and locations. Instead, we’ll list two periods -- the 1990s and the 2000s -- each with one list of nations where the U.S. had long-term deployments and another list of nations where the U.S. briefly committed troops, such as for a rescue of diplomatic personnel or American civilians. For the 2000s, we’ll also add a special category of nations for which the U.S. disclosed that it had dispatched troops for training and preparation for post-9/11 antiterrorism training and other operations. Long deployments, 1993-2000 Bosnia / Macedonia East Timor Former Yugoslavia / Kosovo Haiti Iraq no-fly zone Short deployments, 1993-2000 Afghanistan (airstrike only) Albania Burundi Central African Republic Kenya Liberia Sierra Leone Somalia Sudan (airstrike only) Tanzania Yemen Long deployments, 2001-06 Afghanistan Bosnia Former Yugoslavia / Kosovo Iraq War Short deployments, 2001-06 Cote D’Ivoire East Timor Haiti Lebanon Liberia Global War on Terror deployments, 2001-06 Djibouti Eritrea Ethiopia Georgia Kenya Phillipines Yemen According to our count, from 1993 to 2006, the number of simultaneous deployments dropped below four only for one year -- 1997. Otherwise, the U.S. was juggling at least four and sometimes eight or nine deployments at once. Not all of these previous deployments were equal in scope. Some lasted years and involved ground troops; some lasted just a few days; some were primarily based on air power. But that's also true today. Afghanistan and Iraq are years-long operations with ground forces, while Libya has been a NATO operation in which the U.S. did not have large numbers of troops on the ground. The mission against the Lord’s Resistance Army, meanwhile, looks like some of the smaller operations from the past two decades. To make sure we weren’t missing context, we asked military historians whether they thought our analysis was sound. The two who responded -- Ted Wilson, a history professor at the University of Kansas, and William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia -- agreed that Bachmann was wrong to suggest that four simultaneous deployments represented any kind of landmark. Our ruling A look through history suggests that, contrary to Bachmann’s claim, having four simultaneous military deployments is not only not a landmark, it’s actually become the norm for the U.S. since 1993. We rate her statement False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-10-19T17:43:21	2011-10-18	['United_States']
pomt-00888	Every illegal immigrant "can be eligible for up to $36,000 to $38,000 in earned income tax credits without paying a dime in."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/mar/09/john-fredericks/john-fredericks-says-every-illegal-immigrant-can-b/	John Fredericks, a conservative radio talk show host whose program airs across much of Virginia, has been incensed for months that President Barack Obama bypassed Congress to extend legal status to millions of immigrants. Adding to the outrage, Fredericks says, are recent disclosures that all of these immigrants can be eligible for big tax breaks. Here’s a comment Fredericks made on his Feb. 28 show: "Now we find out that every one of these illegals who came into this country illegally, that worked illegally, broke the law a number of times, now they can be eligible for up to $36,000 to $38,000 in earned income tax credits without paying a dime in." Fredericks made the statement during an interview with U.S. Rep. Bob Hurt, R-5th. Hurt, no fan of Obama, replied, "It’s an absolute nightmare." On the same show, the radio personality repeated himself during an interview with U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-9th. Griffith replied, "I’m fighting like crazy to stop this president and his bad policies that are detrimental to the United States of America." The so-called "amnesty bonuses" have become a talking point in conservative circles. We wondered whether Fredericks is right that, under Obama’s policies, every illegal immigrant could become eligible for up to $38,000 in tax credits -- even if they haven’t paid taxes. The tax credit Obama announced on Nov. 20 that he will delay deportation of immigrants who have lived illegally in the U.S. for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. If the applicants pass background checks and pay a fee, they would qualify for a work permit and avoid deportation for three years at a time. More than 4 million people could qualify for the program, which is scheduled to open for applications this spring but faces a legal challenge from 26 states. Those who qualify for the program would also be able to get a Social Security number because a longstanding policy allows people who have been legally present in the U.S. to obtain the numbers. And with that Social Security number, they would be required to file tax returns and possibly qualify for the earned income tax credit that helps low-income workers. But there’s more. The reclassified immigrants also would be eligible to file or amend tax returns going back three years, provided they can meet income requirements and furnish pay documents. In other words, some will be able to claim four years of credits -- for their current tax filing and three years of back filings. The earned income tax credit slides with the amount of earnings families report and the number of children they have. It’s also adjusted each year for inflation. The maximum amount a family with three or more children can claim this year on their 2014 tax filings is $6,242. The top amount that could be claimed over the last four years, according to IRS documents is $24,320 -- well short of Fredericks’ claim. Of the 28.8 million families that applied for the tax credit on 2012 filings, only 3.5 million -- or 12 percent -- had three or more children, according to IRS figures. To qualify for the maximum credit, those families’ taxable income could have been no greater than about $23,000 a year. Only 1.3 million of those three-child or more families fell into that category, according to computations of IRS data by John Wancheck, who coordinates a program to publicize the earned income tax credit for the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. In other words, only 6.4 percent of families applying for the tax credit in 2012 were eligible for the maximum benefit of about $6,000. The average credit was $2,407. So it’s likely, Wancheck said, that only a small percentage of reclassified immigrants would qualify for the maximum, three-child credit any given year, yet alone four years in a row. Wancheck said certain issues may deter immigrants from trying to recoup the credit from past years: Many may not have the tax records necessary to file back returns; others may be reluctant to go through the hassle for what might end up being a small reward. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen recently told Congress that his agency has not estimated the cost of extending the tax credit to reclassified immigrants. So how did Fredericks come up with the $36,000 to $38,000 credit that he said "everyone of these illegals...can be eligible for?" Fredericks sent us an email noting that in 2013, the maximum credit for three children or more was was $6,044. "So two single illegals living together filing separately with 6 or more kids in the household can claim 3 each and it’s 6,044 x 2 = $12,088 x 3 years = $36,264," he wrote. It’s possible that Fredericks’ hypothetical households exist, but odds are there aren’t many of them. As we’ve noted, 6.4 percent of the families that applied for credit in 2012 qualified for the maximum three-child benefit. That’s about one in 16 families that year. The chances that two such families would live together for three years -- sharing income and filing separate tax returns -- are much lower. Tax payments Fredericks, in his radio statement, also said that all reclassified immigrants can be eligible for the maximum credit " without paying a dime in." This claim runs into trouble because those who will qualify for the credit would have been paying payroll taxes this year and in any past years they would seek to recoup. Although some illegal immigrants work in the underground economy and do not report their income to the government, others do. The IRS issues those workers an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) and accepts their filings without reporting them to immigration authorities. That’s designed to encourage them to pay taxes. A 2011 study by the Department of Treasury estimated 3 million ITIN holders filed federal taxes that year, with 2.3 million getting refunds and 700,000 paying arrears. Stephen Goss, Social Security’s chief actuary, told the Associated Press in February that illegal immigrants have paid $100 billion in Social Security payroll taxes during the last ten years, even though few will be able to collect benefits when they retire. A final note: As we said earlier, a coalition of 26 states -- not including Virginia -- has filed a suit challenging Obama’s action. It contends that Obama exceeded his presidential authority by granting temporary legal status to immigrants without getting approval from Congress. A U.S. District Court judge in Texas has blocked the immigration program until there is a trial on the suit. The White House has appealed the judge’s action. Our ruling Fredericks says, "Now we find out that every one of these illegals who came into this country illegally, that worked illegally, broke the law a number of times, now they can be eligible for up to $36,000 to $38,000 in earned income tax credits without paying a dime in." He’s wrong for a number of reasons: The maximum credits any family could receive is $24,320 for the four most recent tax years. "Everyone of these illegals" is not eligible for the maximum credit. To qualify, a family must have at least three children and a taxable income of no more than about $23,000 a year. Only 6.4 percent of families that applied for the credit in 2012 fell into that category. To receive back payments, immigrants would have to produce earning documents from past years. You can’t get the credit "without paying a dime in." You’d have to pay payroll taxes. Fredericks offers a scenario in which two families living together with three children apiece could claim $36,000 in combined credits if they file taxes separately. But this hypothetical situation lies on the margins and doesn’t buttress Fredericks’ claim that all reclassified immigrants can be eligible for up to the maximum credit. We rate Fredericks’ statement False.	None	John Fredericks	None	None	None	2015-03-09T01:00:00	2015-02-28	['None']
pomt-09609	Says Kay Bailey Hutchison voted for sanctuary cities.	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/15/rick-perry/perry-says-hutchison-supports-sanctuary-cities/	When the candidates faced off on immigration in the GOP primary debate Thursday night, Gov. Rick Perry accused Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of supporting sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. "Senator," he said, "you voted for sanctuary cities." Hutchison said the charge was "absolutely wrong." Who's right? We decided to check the vote. Perry's campaign pointed us to the proposed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. Hutchison voted against an amendment by Sen. Tom Coburn, R.-Okla., to enforce existing border security and immigration laws before granting illegal immigrants amnesty. (The bill itself never passed the Senate.) From a press release Coburn issued, the amendment would have required enforcement of "existing border security and immigration laws before amnesty can be granted to illegal immigrants. These provisions of existing law include: control over maritime borders, full fencing required by law, integrated alien databases, US-VISIT program, biometric ID system, and ending 'sanctuary city' policies." A 1996 provision in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act requires states and localities to pass along someone's immigration and citizenship status on request from any government entity. Coburn's amendment tried to insure it would be enforced. From a 2006 report by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan agency that provides analysis to Congress: "Most cities that are considered sanctuary cities have adopted a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy under which they don't require their employees, including law enforcement officers, to report immigrants who may be illegally present in the country." The Senate rejected the amendment 54-42. Hutchison's campaign said she voted against it because it also prevented local input on the location of a border fence — a project widely opposed in the Rio Grande Valley. "I must protect my constituents," Hutchison said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. Border fence decisions belonged to the Border Patrol, "not the Congress, most of whom have never visited Laredo, Texas." The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which Hutchison voted for, extended reinforced fencing and other barriers, roads, cameras and sensors, along 700 miles of the southern border. Hutchison said that she agreed with with the "purpose" of Coburn's amendment but objected to what she said it would have allowed: government disregard for the opinion of private property owners and cities on the Rio Grande who would be affected by the fence. But by voting to kill the amendment, was she also voting in favor of sanctuary cities? We found no evidence that Coburn considered opposition to his amendment as support for sanctuary cities. Coburn's amendment would have reaffirmed established border and immigration policies. From all evidence, there’s no reasonable way to conclude that Hutchison’s vote against the amendment was a vote in favor of sanctuary cities. Perry's spinning the facts. We rule his claim False.

pomt-08456	Chris Coons has "Marxist beliefs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/14/christine-odonnell/christine-odonnell-claims-chris-coons-has-marxist-/	She's a witch? He's a bearded Marxist? Never a dull moment in the Delaware Senate race between Republican Christine O'Donnell and Democrat Chris Coons. For anyone who took the witchcraft thing seriously (based on comments O'Donnell made on Bill Maher's former show, "Politically Incorrect" in 1999), O'Donnell addressed that with one of the strangest opening lines of a campaign ad, ever: "I am not a witch." Coons meanwhile has been accused of being a "bearded Marxist," based on an article he wrote in college. He hasn't addressed that claim in an ad, but he has taken time to clarify that he is a "clean-shaven capitalist" in several national TV interviews. O'Donnell is apparently not buying it. She repeated the Marxist accusation in an Oct. 13, 2010, debate. "I would be remiss not to bring up the fact that my opponent has recently said that it was studying under a Marxist professor that made him become a Democrat," O'Donnell said. "So when you look at his position on things like raising taxes, which is one of the tenets of Marxism; not supporting eliminating death tax, which is a tenet of Marxism -- I would argue that there are more people who support my Catholic faith than his Marxist beliefs, and I’m using his own words." The origin of the Marxism charge is an opinion piece Coons wrote for the Amherst College student newspaper during his senior year. The headline: "Chris Coons: The Making Of A Bearded Marxist." This is undoubtedly the kind of thing that makes an opposition researcher scream "Cha-ching!" But you don't have to read too far into the article to get that the "Bearded Marxist" line is hyperbole. The article, which ran in the Amherst Student on May 23, 1985, describes Coons' transformation from "somewhat of a Republican fanatic" -- who helped found the Amherst College Republicans in 1983 -- to an ardent Democrat, largely as a result of his experiences spending a semester in Kenya during his junior year. "I spent the spring of my junior year in Africa on the St. Lawrence Kenya Study Program," Coons wrote. "Going to Kenya was one of the few real decisions I have made; my friends, family, and professors all advised against it, but I went anyway. My friends now joke that something about Kenya, maybe the strange diet, or the tropical sun, changed my personality; Africa to them seems a catalytic converter that takes in clean-shaven, clear-thinking Americans and sends back bearded Marxists." For those who missed the "friends now joke" part, we note that the article is accompanied by a picture of Coons in a jacket and tie with the caption, "A clean-shaven Christopher Coons." Here's how Coons responded when asked about the article during the Oct. 13, 2010, debate: "I hope folks will go and read the article," Coons said. "It’s an article that I wrote as a senior the day of our commencement speech, and the title and the content of that clearly makes it obvious that it was a joke. There was a group of folks who I had shared a room with, my roommates junior year, who are in the Young Republican Club and who thought when I returned from Kenya and registered as a Democrat that doing so was proof that I had gone all the way over to the far left end, and so they jokingly called me a bearded Marxist. If you take five minutes and read the article, it's clear on the face of it, it was a joke. Despite that, my opponent and lots of folks in the right wing media have endlessly spun this. I am not now, nor have I ever been, anything but a clean-shaven capitalist." Said O'Donnell: "Well, I would stand to disagree because, first of all, if you're saying what I said on a comedy show is relevant to this election, then absolutely you writing an article, forget the bearded Marxist comment, you writing an article saying that you learned your beliefs from an articulate, intelligent Marxist professor and that's what made you become a Democrat, that should send chills up the spine of every Delaware voter because then if you compare that statement to your policies ... " "If it were accurate, if it were true, I’d agree." Coons shot back. "But it's not accurate. It's not true." In his 1985 article, Coons did praise a Marxist professor he had in Kenya, but he didn't say that what he learned from the professor is what made him become a Democrat. In fact, Coons said in the article that the seeds for change predated his semester in Kenya. "The point that others ignore is that I was ready to change," Coons wrote. "Experiences at Amherst my first two years made me skeptical and uncomfortable with Republicanism, enough so that I wanted to see the Third World for myself to get some perspective on my beliefs. Certainly Kenya provided a needed catalyst; I saw there poverty and oppression more naked than any in America, and I studied under a bright and eloquent Marxist professor at the University of Nairobi. Nevertheless, it is only too easy to return from Africa glad to be an American and smugly thankful for our wealth and freedom. Instead, Amherst had taught me to question, so in return I questioned Amherst, and America." He also credits several professors at Amherst with challenging his political perspective. "More importantly, during my sophomore year, several professors challenged the basic assumptions about America and world relations with which I had grown up. Cultural Anthropology inspired a fascination with other peoples and undermined the accepted value of progress and cultural superiority of the West. In examining the role of 'myths' in primitive cultures, we also studied the myth of equal opportunity in this country, a myth I had never questioned. "I came to suspect, through these and other courses, that the ideal of America as a 'beacon of freedom and justice, providing hope for the world' was not exactly based on reality." Coons wrote that he came to Kenya wondering, "Can private enterprise and democracy solve the problems of developing nations? Is Marxism an evil ideology, leading millions into totalitarian slavery? These were some of the questions in the back of my mind as I left for Kenya." "I realize that Kenya and America are very different, but experiences like this warned me that my own favorite beliefs in the miracles of free enterprise and the boundless opportunity to be had in America might be largely untrue." Coons' article concluded: "I have spent my senior year re-examining my ideas and have returned to loving America, but in the way of one who has realized its faults and failures and still believes in its promise. The greatest value of Amherst for me, then, has been the role it played in allowing me to question, and to think. I had to see the slums of Nairobi before the slums of New York meant anything at all, but without the experiences of Amherst, I never would have seen either." Nowhere in the article does Coons cop to being a Marxist. You can read it in its entirety here. Nor does his resume suggest Marxism. Coons worked as in-house counsel for his stepfather's fabrics company, W.L Gore & Associates, for eight years. In 2000, he was elected New Castle County Council president; and in 2004 was elected New Castle County executive. So what other evidence to back up O'Donnell's claim that Coons is a Marxist? We didn't hear back from the O'Donnell campaign, but during the debate, O'Donnell said we need look no further than some of Coons' positions, "like raising taxes, which is one of the tenets of Marxism; not supporting eliminating death tax, which is a tenet of Marxism." We wrote yesterday about Coons proposing to raise property taxes by about 50 percent while acting as the New Castle County Executive. But does raising taxes make you a Marxist? By that measure, were Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush Marxists? O'Donnell has called for the elimination of estate taxes, and Coons has not. But again, does that make him a Marxist? Hardly. What the Communist Manifesto called for was abolishing the right of inheritance, not allowing inheritance and taxing it. Conservatives increasingly have been using labels like socialist and Marxist to attack Democrats. With Coons, the case is irresponsibly thin. Praising a Marxist professor from college as "bright and eloquent" does not make one a Marxist. And any clear-eyed reading of Coons' "The Making of a Bearded Marxist" article would make it obvious the "bearded Marxist" line was a joke playing off the jabs of some of Coons' conservative buddies at college. O'Donnell's claim is ridiculously false, so we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Christine O'Donnell	None	None	None	2010-10-14T18:13:43	2010-10-13	['Chris_Coons']
pomt-00080	"Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average."	mostly true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/nov/01/kendra-fershee/west-virginia-poverty-5-higher-us-whole/	Kendra Fershee, a Democrat who is challenging U.S. Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., took aim at the poverty rate in a Sept. 19 Facebook post. "Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average," Fershee wrote in the post. "The poor are getting (much) poorer and if you look at what my opponent is posting (stories about how great the economy is, using national statistics) he doesn’t even seem to know that there’s a problem in WV." She added, "Are you ok with our state diving deeper into despair while our elected officials: vote for policy that drives wages lower, push to strip healthcare from poor people and people with pre-existing conditions, and then pat themselves on the back for a job well done? I’m not. This is unacceptable. But WE can fix it on Nov. 6." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether poverty in West Virginia is more than 5 percent higher than the national average. So we took a closer look. The post links to a Sept. 18 article in the Parkersburg News and Sentinel headlined, "Poverty increases in W.Va." According to the article, "About 336,000 West Virginians lived in poverty in 2017, 5.7 percent higher than the national average. West Virginia was among the top four states with poverty rates of 18 percent – Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and West Virginia." To confirm the newspaper’s data, we turned to the original figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. The numbers check out: The U.S poverty rate was 13.4 percent, but the West Virginia poverty rate was 19.1. The difference: 5.7 percentage points. To be precise, however, Fershee should have said that the poverty rate in West Virginia is more than 5 percentage points higher than the United States as a whole -- not 5 percent higher. If it were 5 percent higher, the poverty rate in West Virginia would be about 14.1 percent, not 19.1 percent. So the poverty rate in West Virginia is actually higher than Fershee’s literal words suggested. In an interview, Fershee said that it’s important to note that "the rest of the country is doing better, and West Virginia’s poverty rate has actually worsened," said Fershee. The historical data bears that out. Here’s a chart of the U.S. and West Virginia poverty rates going back to 2005. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In 2012, the gap between the U.S. and West Virginia poverty rates was 1.9 percentage points. Five years later, the gap was 5.7 points. Our ruling Fershee said, "Poverty in WV is more than 5% higher than the national average." Only a slip-up in her mathematical terminology keeps this from being fully accurate. The poverty rate in West Virginia was 5.7 percentage points higher than the national rate, not more than 5 percent higher. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11756	Half of the proposed federal tax breaks ​"would go to the wealthiest 1 percent."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/dec/05/roy-cooper/nc-governor-cherry-picks-stats-showing-tax-breaks-/	North Carolina’s U.S. senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, are among the most vocal proponents of GOP plans to change the federal tax code. The Tar Heel State’s top Democrat, meanwhile, is among the plans’ most high-profile detractors. Gov. Roy Cooper recently criticized House and Senate efforts to cut taxes, saying they overwhelmingly favor groups that need help the least – large corporations and millionaires. While Tillis recently pointed to North Carolina as a positive example for change, Cooper highlighted what he said were the negative consequences of the state tax code and said Congress’ efforts seem "eerily familiar" in his state. The tax reform efforts in NC and in Washington have divided local Republicans and Democrats. "Unfortunately, decisions made by the Republican state legislature have left too many middle class families out of our state’s economic growth," Cooper wrote in a Nov. 30 op-ed published on Medium.com. "Those decisions rigged the system to let those at the top reap most of the rewards." Congressional Republicans, he said, are charting the same course. "In total, it is estimated that half of the tax breaks in this proposal would go to the wealthiest 1 percent," Cooper wrote. "The Joint Committee on Taxation shows that, on average, taxpayers earning $75,000 or less would end up paying more in taxes." PolitiFact’s recent fact-check of Tillis shows that Cooper is partly right about taxpayers who earn less than $75,000 a year, but he left out the fact that most Americans would get a tax cut initially. Experts say that, by 2027, the Senate plan will leave them paying more in taxes, barring further changes in law. There are two tax plans being considered right now: a Senate plan and a House plan. PolitiFact recently published an explanation of both here. Unlike Tillis, Cooper didn’t single out one of the plans. Instead he spoke generally about how "this proposal" would affect the wealthiest Americans. The plan changes by year PolitiFact reached out to Cooper for clarification. Ford Porter, his spokesman, cited analyses of each plan by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The Tax Policy Center (let’s call it the TPC) found that the Senate plan gives 61.8 percent of the tax cuts to the top 1 percent "once the cuts are phased-in," Porter said. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "Their analysis of the House bill showed 47 percent (of the cuts) going to the top 1 percent," he added. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Porter is right. But key words to consider are "once the cuts are phased in." The report shows that estimates don’t bear out Cooper’s claim until 2027, because that’s when many of the deductions for lower-income Americans are phased-out. In 2019, the center says the top 1 percent would get 17.6 percent of the Senate plan’s total federal tax change, a share that would rise to 22 percent in 2025. Porter acknowledges that distinction in his email. But Cooper’s op-ed failed to elaborate on his claim, which isn’t true if examined in the years prior to 2027. Change, in dollars What does that look like in financial terms? The Tax Foundation is a conservative-leaning nonprofit organization that examines the link between tax policies and the economy. The foundation found that, under the Senate plan, the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would initially keep 1.1 to 1.9 percent more of their income. America’s wealthiest – the one-percenters – would initially keep about 7.5 percent more of their money because of cuts to the corporate tax rate, as well as the income tax rate. By 2027, things change for the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers. The foundation estimates they’ll keep just 0.3 to 0.4 percent more. The top 1 percent, however, would keep 4.5 percent more compared to today’s rates. The TPC has a similar analysis. The center says that in 2019, the Senate plan would cut taxes by an average of $900 for taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $87,000 a year. The average tax cut for the top 1 percent would be $34,000. The House bill similarly phases-out deductions for lower-income Americans, said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate for the TPC. In the House bill, for example, "there’s a $300 child and family credit that expires after five years at the end of 2022. That would be for a family of four, that would be a $1,200 tax credit," Rosenberg said. By 2027, the analysis says those middle-income taxpayers would get cuts of less than 0.1 percent while the average "one-percenters" would still enjoy taxes that are 1.4 percent lower than they are right now. Our ruling Cooper said half of the tax breaks in Senate Republicans’ proposal would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. If key changes in the plan remain temporary, Cooper’s claim would come to fruition, but not for 10 years. Cooper’s op-ed doesn’t explain that change. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-11589	"A single immigrant can bring in unlimited numbers of distant relatives."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/31/donald-trump/donald-trumps-misleading-claim-about-chain-migrati/	President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address called for tighter control of legal immigration and for an end to "chain migration." "Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives," Trump said Jan. 30. "Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children." The White House did not respond on the record for this fact-check, but it appears that Trump meant a distant relative is anyone who is not a spouse or minor child (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services defines "child" as being unmarried and under 21 years old). Neither U.S. citizens nor lawful permanent residents can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent to come to the United States. Theoretically, one immigrant’s arrival in the United States could lead to the immigration of an aunt or uncle — if the first immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen and petitioned a parent, that parent could eventually become a U.S. citizen and petition his or her siblings. But there is a long queue for certain relatives seeking to come through family sponsorship. For brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, the waiting period for a visa is over 13 years. Type of relatives that can be sponsored by U.S. citizens and green card holders U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can bring certain family members to the United States to live here permanently. But there are restrictions. No one can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent, according to USCIS. Green card holders can petition for a spouse and unmarried children, including unmarried sons and daughters 21 and over. Sponsorship categories expand for U.S. citizens, who can also petition for married children. Sons and daughters of U.S. citizens can include their own children in the petition. If a U.S. citizen is over 21 years old, he or she also can sponsor parents, brothers and sisters to come here on a green card. Additionally, U.S. citizens can also sponsor a fiance or fiancee to come on a nonimmigrant visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage. Unmarried, under 21-year-old children of a fiance, fiancee or spouse of a U.S. citizen can also be admitted on nonimmigrant visas and later adjust their status. Is there a way that an immigrant ‘can bring in’ an aunt or uncle, indirectly? If an immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen, he or she can sponsor a parent. If that parent eventually becomes a U.S. citizen, he or she could sponsor a brother or sister (the aunt or uncle of the original immigrant), noted Steven Camarota, director of research for Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration levels. "You could see that as indirect sponsorship of aunts and uncles," Camarota said. Indirect sponsorship is theoretically possible, but would take a long time, said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013. An immigrant would first have to become a naturalized citizen — an option available after being a permanent resident for at least five years. As a naturalized citizen, an immigrant can petition for siblings, and the siblings could bring in their spouses and unmarried children. But there are limits on the number of visas issued per year per family category. More than 3.9 million people were in line for a visa as of Nov. 1, 2017, according to the U.S. State Department. Brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a "fourth-preference" category, which had 2.3 million people waiting for a visa — the wait period is over 13 years for immigrants from most nations, but even longer for some countries with heavy demand, such as Mexico and the Philippines. Siblings in the Philippines would have to wait at least 23 years for a visa, and Mexican siblings at least 20 years. "As a practical matter, because of these long backlogs there is not as much chain migration as President Trump claims," said Stephen W. Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School. Our ruling Trump said "a single immigrant can bring in unlimited numbers of distant relatives." Trump’s team did not go on the record to identify who Trump considered to be "distant relatives," but it appears he’s referring to anyone who is not a spouse or minor child. Green card holders can sponsor a spouse and unmarried children, including unmarried sons and daughters over 21 years old. For U.S. citizens, the categories expand to include parents, married children, brothers and sisters. No one can directly petition an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent. But theoretically, one immigrant’s arrival in the United States could lead to the immigration of an aunt or uncle — if the first immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen and petitioned a parent, that parent could eventually become a U.S. citizen and petition his or her siblings. Still, there are numerical limits on visas issued per year per family category. For some relatives, the wait period for a visa is over 13 years.

pomt-00228	"At (Mike Braun’s) company, the deductible on his health care is $10,000."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/11/joe-donnelly/mike-braun-health-care-10000-deductibles/	Incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly painted himself as a guardian of health insurance and Republican opponent Mike Braun as its main threat during their first debate. "I was the final vote to save health care," Donnelly said of his opposition to the so-called skinny repeal of the Affordable Care Act. "At (Braun’s) company, the deductible on his health care if $10,000, which is completely unaffordable. He has every time tried to take away pre-existing conditions coverage and supports the lawsuit today that would do that." Braun did not respond to the attack in the debate, but in his rebuttal he said he "took on health care" and "held premiums for 10 years while covering pre-existing conditions." We rated Mostly True an earlier claim from Donnelly that Braun supported ending coverage for pre-existing conditions. But when it comes to his business, Meyer Distributing, does Braun charge $10,000 deductibles? Meyer Distributing is an auto parts distribution company. According to Braun’s campaign, the company had 452 employees in Indiana as of April. The majority make between $10 and $17 an hour. The employee benefits enrollment guide from 2018 confirms family deductibles are $10,000, and $5,000 for individuals. The health plan is valid from March 1, 2018, to Feb. 28, 2019. We were unable to find any other health plans offered, and the Braun campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Meyer offers a high-deductible health plan. That means that health care costs are absorbed by the employee until they reach that set limit (of $5,000 or $10,000). Doctor’s office visits, prescriptions and emergency room visits are not covered until then. Preventive care costs, on the other hand, are fully covered regardless of whether the deductible has been met. Those include annual preventive physicals and tests, routine prenatal care, immunizations, and screening services. The individual deductible roughly doubles national averages, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation published on Oct. 3. The 2018 average for individuals was $2,349 and $4,676 for families. Meyer’s plan is still within the limits set by the Affordable Care Act, which caps out-of-pocket costs at $7,350 for an individual plan and $14,700 for a family. Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that on average, employers that offer such plans contribute more than $1,000 to employees’ health savings accounts. We found no indication in the guide whether Meyer contributes or not. Premiums at Meyer, however, were lower than the national average. That’s the money employees pay for health care coverage with each paycheck, if enrolled. Workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for individuals, or $198.44 for the employee, spouse and children, which translates to $891.80 and $5,159.44 a year, respectively. The national average worker contribution to the premium is $1,074 for individuals and $4,631 for families. Braun said he has held premiums steady for 10 years. Individual premiums are lower at Meyer than the national average dating back to 2010. Average premiums have been increasing each year, so keeping premiums steady for 10 years would be unusual, according to Pollitz.

pomt-09811	If you "already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/health-insurance-through-work-stays-place-under-re/	Seeking to jump-start efforts to pass a health care bill, President Barack Obama defended his reform plan in a speech to a joint session of Congress. He sought to reassure Americans they would not lose their current coverage. "First, if you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have," Obama said. "Let me repeat this: Nothing in our plan requires you to change what you have." Obama is correct that the plans under consideration do not force those who currently have insurance to change plans. The proposals seek to build on the current system, where many Americans get coverage through work. The plans do, however, implement new consumer protections and introduce new ways of regulating health insurance companies. These new rules will surely change the current health care system. The bill in the House of Representatives gives employer-provided insurance five years to come into compliance with new rules, such as caps on out-of-pocket expenses and coverage for preventive care. Right now, employers have the freedom to change or drop coverage, and they will continue to have that freedom under health reform. Doctors, too, can opt in or out of accepting various insurance plans, including Medicare. Because of this inherent instability to the health care system, and because of the new regulations, we rated one of Obama's earlier statements on the effects of reform — "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan" — Half True . Given what we know about reform, it seems likely that at least some people will have employers who decide to change plans when insurers alter their offerings under the new regulations. This would be most likely for any small businesses that currently offer health insurance. They will be allowed to use a national exchange where insurers compete to offer insurance, and prices are expected to be lower. Obama's statement from the speech is more carefully phrased than his earlier statement. In his speech, he said that if you are "already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have." That is true, there is nothing in the plan that proactively forces these kinds of changes, and the bills clearly intend to leave much of the current health care system in place. We rate Obama's statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-09-09T19:30:35	2009-09-09	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-13843	California’s Proposition 63 would "CRIMINALIZE the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/jul/12/firearms-policy-coalition/will-ca-gun-control-measure-criminalize-sharing-bu/	Proposition 63, a gun and ammunition control initiative on California’s November ballot, would require instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Known as the Safety For All Initiative and proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to California’s already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than gun control bills introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De León and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but "criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners." The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights. We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends? Our research We started by checking the text of the Proposition. It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales "be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor," according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted. Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or "transferring" ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice. The measure would: -- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with "any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know" is banned from owning or possessing ammunition; -- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them; -- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition; The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code. "They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person," Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email. Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment. An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our ruling The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed California’s Proposition 63 would "Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together." The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing. It would be it illegal to knowingly share bullets with a felon; to share with any other person banned from owning them; or with anyone who would subsequently share them with a banned person. It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition. Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor. The coalition’s statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would "criminalize" all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner. Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know they’re not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-06994	Says legislative debate of airport pat-down procedures initiated federal changes in security procedures.	false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-debate-pat-down-legislation-/	Gov. Rick Perry saw a silver lining in state lawmakers not sending him legislation penalizing airport security officers if they get too physical while searching passengers. As a June special legislative session ended, Perry said in a June 29 press release that "although the airport pat-down bill did not pass, it did initiate a public discussion and some changes in airport security procedures." Did debate at the Texas Capitol drive a national shift? Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us toward an earlier Perry statement that referred to a Transportation Security Administration reassessment of pat-down searches of children 12 and younger. The June 23 statement by the governor’s office said the agency’s change of policy "follows Gov. Perry's recent addition of legislation to the (agenda) of the special session of the Texas Legislature to address this issue." Perry added: "TSA's policy change is a step in the right direction to regain the trust of American families." According to an ABC News report, the federal agency had issued a statement the day before, June 22, saying that its chief administrator, John Pistole, "has made a policy decision to give security officers more options for resolving screening anomalies with young children, and we are working to operationalize his decision in airports. This decision will ultimately reduce — though not eliminate — pat downs of children." The news report notes that Perry had recently added the airport security issue to the special session’s agenda; that action occurred June 20. During the regular session that ended in May, legislation making it a criminal offense for airport security officials to touch "the anus, sexual organ, buttocks or breast of another person," even through clothing, had cleared the Texas House before stalling in the Senate. And a June 27 Associated Press news report quotes state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, defending a watered-down version of the pat-down measure under consideration in the special session. Referring to the already-announced federal policy change, Patrick said, "The goal is to get the TSA to change their policy. TSA is going (to) change their policy because Texas is taking the lead." But we couldn’t find independent indications that the Texas debate touched off the federal change. Instead, we found that public outrage began flaring late last fall over the new enhanced pat-down procedures and that TSA officials have been talking about changing the procedures ever since. TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said that Pistole "began evaluating risk-based changes to the checkpoint security process, including the process for screening children, shortly after he was sworn into office in July" 2010. Kimball pointed us to a Nov. 21, 2010, statement from Pistole saying, in part, "We are constantly evaluating and adapting our security measures, and as we have said from the beginning, we are seeking to strike the right balance between privacy and security." Kimball also noted a March speech by Pistole to an American Bar Association group. Pistole said then: "We want to focus our limited resources on higher-risk passengers, while speeding and enhancing the passenger experience at the airport. I believe what we're working on will provide better security by more effectively deploying our resources, while also improving passengers' travel experiences by potentially streamlining the screening experience for many people." Kimball also pointed out news reports such as an April 12 CNN report topped by mention of the recent pat-down of a 6-year-old girl at the New Orleans airport. The report quotes the agency as saying that Pistole "has tasked the agency with exploring additional ways to focus its resources and move beyond a one-size-fits-all system while maintaining a high level of security. As part of this effort, TSA has been actively reviewing its screening policies and procedures to streamline and improve the screening experience for low-risk populations, such as younger passengers." We pressed Kimball about connections between the pat-down debate in Texas and the agency’s June change of policy. He replied by email that the Legislature's debate "did not have an impact." Perry’s office isn’t convinced. Frazier said by email that the "fact remains that TSA took action a mere two days after the governor's addition (of the anti-groping topic) to the agenda of the special session." She continued: "We've never claimed the addition to the (agenda) was the sole catalyst of TSA’s changes. But as we’ve said before, we do believe that making it a legislative issue in the midst of Americans’ escalating frustration toward TSA’s invasive pat-down searches played a role in the agency’s decision to finally take action, and make changes to its policy that are a step in the right direction." It’s reasonable to say the debate in Austin brought even more attention to pat-downs. But the TSA was already catching flack for the procedures two months before the Legislature convened. And we found no evidence the Texas debate initiated, as Perry puts it, the administration’s policy change. We rate Perry’s statement False.

pomt-05673	"In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/16/texas-democratic-party/texas-democratic-party-says-texas-has-668-latino-e/	Heads up: Another Bush is raising his profile. As noted in a March 3, 2012, Texas Tribune news article, attorney George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush, has been pitching afresh for a group he helped found, the Hispanic Republicans of Texas. "Politics is in my blood," the Tribune story quotes Bush as saying in a story about the group's political action committee. But Rebecca Acuña, spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, sounded skeptical of the PAC’s chances of helping Republican Hispanics advance. Acuña told the Tribune: "They are delusional if they think they’re making any inroads with Latinos. In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party." Do Hispanic Democratic elected officials so greatly outnumber their Latino Republican counterparts in Texas? Looked entirely like it -- at first. To our inquiry, Acuña sent us portions of a 2011 directory of Latino elected officials compiled by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which describes itself as the nonpartisan leadership organization of the nation's more than 6,000 Latino elected and appointed officials. The chart provided by Acuña says that of 2,520 Hispanic elected officials in Texas in January 2011, 668 were Democrats and 60 were Republicans, matching the figures aired to the Tribune. Two school board members were counted as Independents. According to the chart, 496 elected Latino officials in Texas held nonpartisan offices, mainly serving in municipal government or on school boards, and another 1,294 Latino elected officials, also mostly serving on school boards or in municipal offices, were listed as "no party stated." And how does NALEO gather all this? A methodology section of the 2011 directory says the NALEO Educational Fund has regularly attempted to tabulate Latino elected officials since 1984. For the 2011 check, NALEO staff contacted each identified official by phone or fax to ask whether they were indeed Latino, the group says. "The phone verification process proved invaluable," the methodology section says. "Many individuals having Spanish surnames were in fact, not Latino. Conversely, other individuals with non-Spanish surnames were identified as being Latino." Rosalind Gold, a senior director for the NALEO Educational Fund, told us in a telephone interview that how officeholders self-identify has proved pivotal. "We very much rely on self-identification in determining who is and who is not Latino," Gold said. By email, Martha Recio, a NALEO research assistant, confirmed the figures cited for 2011. At our request, NALEO also composed a chart showing its identified party breakdowns for Texas Latino elected officials for 2001 through 2011. The group’s determinations of party affiliations have been incomplete because, Gold told us, so many local offices are filled in non-partisan elections; such candidates do not run as party nominees. In each of the years, at least 68 percent of the Latino elected officials tabulated by NALEO were not identified by party affiliation. Also, Gold said, if the group could not verify an officeholder’s party membership by telephoning their office, it did not attempt to do so by tapping other sources. NALEO doesn’t have resources to do that, she said. Sometimes, too, Gold said, an officeholder declined to discuss his or her party membership. We asked Gold if it’s fair to make comparisons limited to its counts of Republican and Democratic Latino elected officials when most of the group’s identified Latino elected officials are not identified by party. Gold replied that this is the kind of context NALEO provides when discussing its counts. "We say that of the elected officials we were able to verify affiliation for, here is the party breakdown," she said. Back to the Texas counts: Among officeholders tabulated as Democrats or Republicans, the share of Democratic elected officeholders dropped from 32 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2010 before reaching nearly 27 percent in 2011. The relative share of Latino Republican officeholders was .7 percent in 2001, escalating to .9 percent in 2010 and 2.4 percent in 2011, according to the group. With so many party affiliations not nailed down, we wouldn’t blame anyone for ruling out comparisons of results for different years. That misgiving aside, though, it looks like the ratio of elected Hispanic Democrats to Republican Latinos in Texas has narrowed. The NALEO counts suggest there were nearly 45 Hispanic Texas Democrats per Republican counterpart in 2001, 34 in 2005 and 11 in 2011. Our ruling The Texas Democratic Party’s spokeswoman correctly cited two figures from the 2011 NALEO directory suggesting that Latino elected Democrats in Texas greatly outnumber their Republican counterparts. Still, this claim is missing substantive context -- that NALEO did not determine the party memberships of most Latino Texas officeholders. If this were done, the Democratic-Republican ratio might change. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12704	Carbon dioxide is not "a primary contributor to the global warming that we see."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/10/scott-pruitt/epa-head-scott-pruitt-says-carbon-dioxide-not-prim/	The new head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt says carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to global warming. "Do you believe that it’s been proven that CO2 is the primary control knob for climate?" CNBC anchor Joe Kernen asked Pruitt in a March 9 interview. "No, I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact," Pruitt responded. "So no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." Scientists around the globe generally conclude that human activity is the leading cause of climate change because humans have exacerbated the Earth’s greenhouse effect, mainly by producing carbon dioxide. Compare Pruitt’s statement with one on his agency’s website, for example: "It is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming," and then, "Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change." Environmental activists opposed Pruitt’s nomination, in part because in his former role as attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times over air and water pollution regulations. However, Pruitt has said he believes in climate change and that human activity is contributing to that change, though he is unconvinced of the extent of human-caused factors. "The climate is changing, and human activity impacts that," he said in his Senate confirmation hearing. When we reached the EPA for comment, they did not provide us with information to back up Pruitt’s claim. The normal environment of the earth is that several types of gas stick in the atmosphere and trap excess heat, including carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane and nitrous oxide, making a natural "greenhouse." Since the Industrial Revolution in the early 1800s, humans have changed the composition of the greenhouse — leading to climate change — by releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the air primarily through burning fossil fuels. "Pruitt is incorrect. CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. That fact is not in dispute among climate scientists," said Anne Slinn, executive director for research of the Center for Global Change Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that even though the earth has experienced fluctuations in carbon dioxide levels throughout its history, there’s more carbon dioxide now than there has been in at least 400,000 years. The previous peak carbon dioxide concentration was about 300 parts per million, 300,000 years ago. Today, the count is more than 400 parts per million. By the end of the 1970s, before global warming was readily apparent, scientists had already formed a consensus that human-produced carbon dioxide would cause the climate to change. And by the mid-1990s, scientists understood that global warming had already occurred over the past 100 years, and carbon dioxide was a substantial cause, said Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps CO2 Center at the University of California, San Diego. "Administrator Pruitt’s statement means that he does not accept the overwhelming scientific consensus," said Stephen Pacala, co-director of Princeton University’s Carbon Mitigation Initiative, pointing to a 2013 report out of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We reached numerous climate experts, all of whom reiterated the view that Pruitt’s claim is contrary to the prevailing scientific thought. For a perspective outside the norm, we also reached out to Roger Pielke Sr., an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, who has argued that carbon dioxide is one of many human-caused factors contributing to long-term changes in the climate, but it’s not the dominant one. For example, the release of black carbon (soot) or land use changes might have a larger effect on the climate relative to carbon dioxide than is currently believed. In Pielke’s view, a more accurate version of Pruitt’s statement would be: "I would not agree that CO2 is the only contributor to changes and longterm variations in climate." Our ruling Pruitt said carbon dioxide is not "a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." The prevailing scientific consensus is that human production of carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution is a leading cause of climate change. Some scientists may quibble over how much of the change can be attributed specifically to carbon dioxide, but there is no doubt that it plays an important role. We rate Pruitt’s claim False.

pomt-08319	"North Dakota's economy is reeling."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/29/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-north-dakotas-economy-reeling-/	The pro-Republican group Crossroads GPS recently began airing ads in at least eight House districts, all using virtually identical language to decry the state of the economy and the Democratic agenda in Congress. Here's the ad for North Dakota, which blasts the stewardship of incumbent Democratic Rep. Earl Pomeroy. Pomeroy faces a stiff challenge this year from Republican Rick Berg. "North Dakota's economy is reeling, and Congressman Earl Pomeroy is making it worse," says the ad, which was released Oct. 25, 2010. "While he should be helping us, he's supporting Nancy Pelosi and her failed agenda, voting for billions in new debt and reckless spending, including Pelosi's $800 billion stimulus boondoggle, filled with sweetheart deals and handouts to special interests. Reckless spending, massive debt, helping Pelosi, not us. Earl Pomeroy, wrong for North Dakota." We were tipped off that something was amiss when Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Congress, published an article on Oct. 28, 2010, that noted that the Pomeroy camp was challenging the description of North Dakota's economy as "reeling." With barely disguised glee, a Pomeroy spokesman, Brenden Timpe, fired a barb at Karl Rove, who helped organize Crossroads GPS and its affiliate, American Crossroads. "Next time Karl Rove wants to funnel secret money to North Dakota to influence our elections, he ought to visit our state first or at least pick up one of our newspapers," Timpe said. "If he did, he would know that North Dakota’s economy is doing quite well, thank you very much, and Earl has been a strong partner in that progress." How well is North Dakota doing as the rest of the country muddles through a rough patch for the economy? On a relative basis at least, quite well indeed, thanks to a surge in natural resource extraction and relatively little decline in a housing market that never really boomed. Here are some statistical benchmarks we located. -- Unemployment. Today, North Dakota has the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, at 3.7 percent. That's just over one-third -- yes, that's one-third -- of the national unemployment rate of 9.6 percent. And this low unemployment rate is nothing new. North Dakota's annual unemployment rate for 2009 also ranked as the best in the nation at 4.3 percent, compared to a 9.3 percent rate nationally. In 2008, North Dakota ranked second (3.2 percent, compared to 5.8 percent nationally). In 2007, it ranked eighth (3.1 percent, compared to 4.6 percent nationally). And in 2006, it ranked seventh (3.2 percent, compared to 4.6 percent nationally). -- Personal income. Total personal income in North Dakota rose 23 percent between 2006 and 2009, compared to 8 percent nationally. It rose by 12 percent in North Dakota between 2007 and 2009, compared to 2 percent nationally. And it fell by 1 percent between 2008 and 2009, compared to a national decline of 2 percent. So personal income in North Dakota did fall between 2008 and 2009, but it fell more slowly than the national rate, and it followed on two years of personal income growth, far ahead of the national rate. The story is much the same for per capita personal income. It rose by 21 percent between 2006 and 2009 and by 10 percent between 2007 and 2009 before falling by 2 percent between 2008 and 2009. -- Gross domestic product. GDP information by state is not available for 2009, so the full impact of the recession is not yet measurable. But the data that's available shows that the state enjoyed a nice boom between 2006 and 2008. State GDP rose by 12 percent between 2006 and 2007, compared to 1.9 percent nationally. And it rose by 9 percent between 2007 and 2008, compared to zero increase nationally. So on this score, North Dakota did well indeed. When we asked Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for Crossroads GPS, if the group had any defense for its characterization, he said, "Unemployment is up significantly in the last two years in North Dakota, and much of that is due to the massive debt created by (President Barack) Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Earl Pomeroy." But let's put it into context: The unemployment rate in North Dakota rose from 3.4 percent two years ago, in September 2008, to 3.7 percent in September 2010. The number of unemployed North Dakotans has risen from 12,365 to 13,714 -- a total of 1,349 people, or less than 1 percent of the civilian, non-institutionalized population in the state. We think most Americans would be happier with that kind of economy than the one in their own state. Judging by the ads on Crossroads GPS' website, we think the Pomeroy camp's charge that the ad is "cookie cutter" is accurate. At the very least, Crossroads was careless in the degree to which it adapted its ads to each state's specific context. In these sorts of economic times, it verges on the ridiculous to say that North Dakota's economy is "reeling." We rate the ad Pants on Fire!

pomt-14140	Says he "started" the Pacur plastics manufacturing company he owns.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/04/ron-johnson/incomplete-claim-sen-ron-johnson-started-pacur-his/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who is trailing but gaining on Democratic challenger Russ Feingold in the latest poll, announced April 29, 2016 he is launching a tour of Wisconsin as part of his re-election campaign. A routine notice. Until this line in his news release: "Ron’s statewide tour will include stops at Pacur, the Oshkosh plastics manufacturing company he started in 1979." The statement suggests the company was started only by Johnson, or at least that he was main person who launched it. But that seems to contradict the established history of Pacur (pronounced liked packer), and is in conflict with some of Johnson’s own statements. It’s long been widely reported that Johnson was there at the beginning of Pacur. But with analysts saying he is among the most vulnerable Senate incumbents in the November 2016 elections, did Johnson’s campaign overstate his role in starting the company? After all, the name Pacur comes from Pat Curler -- Johnson’s brother-in-law. Rewriting history Questions first arose when Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative columnist Daniel Bice reported that Johnson had rewritten his own company history on Aug. 25, 2010. That was less than three weeks before the GOP primary and about 10 weeks before Johnson upset Feingold, an 18-year incumbent, in the 2010 Senate election. For nearly nine years, Bice wrote, Pacur carried this online description of its beginning: Founded in 1977, Pacur occupies a facility constructed specifically for sheet extrusion, which provides polyester and polypropylene sheet and rollstock to converters, distributors, and end users. The revised description, now carrying an asterisk, said the founding occurred two years later, in 1979. The asterisk pointed out that Pacur had a predecessor -- Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies -- that came into existence in 1977 before it was renamed and restructured in 1979. In other words, Pacur grew out of an existing company, Wisconsin Industrial Shipping Supplies. That company was owned by Curler, the brother of Johnson’s wife. Johnson’s statements Johnson’s own statements haven't always been as credit-taking as the line in the news release. Some examples from the 2010 campaign: The Journal Sentinel reported that Johnson said he began working as Pacur's accountant and co-founder in July or August of 1979. The article stated that both companies were led by Curler, and that Curler was Johnson's initial boss. Pacur "was an opportunity for (Curler) to get into business for himself, and I just kind of came along for the ride as the accountant," Johnson said in another Journal Sentinel article. Johnson had been calling himself a co-founder of the company, but later acknowledged he joined several months after Pacur was established, the Associated Press reported. He started as a machine operator and accountant and eventually became its president, the article said. More recent statements also reinforce the idea that Johnson, who bought Pacur in 1997, didn't start the company alone. Johnson’s official Senate website says he started the company with Curler. So did a tweet Johnson sent in in March 2016. Defending the statement in the press release, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us Johnson "helped build Pacur into a great Wisconsin success story, and we've never said anything counter to how it all began." Our rating Announcing a statewide tour in his campaign for reelection, a Johnson news release said Johnson "started" the Pacur plastics manufacturing company he owns. The claim contradicts Pacur’s own company history and Johnson’s prior statements, which make it clear he helped start Pacur with his brother-in-law, who was more involved in the founding. Johnson didn't do it alone. The news release doesn’t indicate an attempt by Johnson to rewrite history, but he is responsible for his campaign statements, and this one left out important details.

In January, the governor returned from a trip to Cuba aimed at bolstering the commonwealth’s commercial ties with the nation. The U.S. still has a decades-long embargo on most trade with Cuba. But a 2000 law allows limited exports of agricultural products and medical equipment. In 2014, Obama re-established formal diplomatic relations with Cuba. McAuliffe supports ending the trade embargo. Brian Coy, the governor’s spokesman, pointed us to a Feb. 12 news release where McAuliffe announced that last year Virginia exported $41.6 million in agricultural goods to Cuba, all of it soybeans and soybean meal. In past years, Virginia also has shipped apples, poultry and beef. McAuliffe said the 2015 export tally was the most that any state had sent to Cuba that year. We tracked down the same trade figures through an online database provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It shows that in 2015, Virginia’s $41.6 million indeed was the most of any state, followed by Georgia, which had $30.9 million in agricultural exports to Cuba; and Florida, which had $29.9 million in exports. Rounding out the top five agricultural exporters to Cuba were Alabama and Louisiana. Altogether, the U.S. exported nearly $150 million in agricultural goods to Cuba last year. A 2015 article from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond noted Virginia’s farm exports accounted for 28 percent of all U.S. agricultural exports last year, compared with the 21 percent share for Georgia and 20 percent share for Florida. Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Louisiana generally have dominated the share of U.S. exports to Cuba since 2011. McAuliffe is correct that the 2015 figures are a turnabout of sorts for Virginia. In 2012, the state had $65.6 million in agricultural exports to Cuba, and that fell to $24.9 million in 2014, ranking it fifth behind those other four Southern states. Last year was the first time Virginia reached the goal of becoming the top agricultural exporter to Cuba, said Todd Haymore, the state’s secretary of agriculture and forestry. Haymore told us Virginia and other Southern states’ proximity to Cuba provides an advantage in tapping the Cuban market. Other factors helped, he said. For example, Georgia has focused on expanding an agricultural export facility in Savannah, Haymore said. Florida, meanwhile, has extensive port operations, the secretary said. Haymore said a "significant" share of Virginia’s agricultural exports to Cuba were produced in the commonwealth, although he added that Virginia’s ports also ship products that originate from other states, including Maryland and North Carolina. This year, it looks like Virginia has some serious competition if it wants to retain its billing as the top agricultural exporter to Cuba. Figures from January, the only month for which export figures are available so far this year, show that Louisiana sent $17.9 million in agricultural exports to Cuba that month, and Alabama sent $2.1 million. Virginia’s $1.7 million ranked third. While Virginia has seen its exports to Cuba go up and down and then back up in recent years, it’s been a different story for U.S. trade to the island nation. The total value of all U.S. exports to Cuba actually has been waning, even amid White House overtures to open trade. U.S. exports to Cuba dropped from $464.5 million in 2012 to $180.3 million last year, according to figures from the U.S. Commerce Department. Our ruling McAuliffe said Virginia is the top exporter of agricultural products to Cuba. The numbers from the latest year available back his claim. We rate his statement True.

pomt-12607	"I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/apr/03/jon-ossoff/jon-ossoff-national-security-background/	In Georgia’s closely watched congressional special election, the surprisingly strong Democratic candidate, Jon Ossoff, has touted his policy experience in national security -- and taken heat for allegedly embellishing it. Ossoff is running to succeed Republican Tom Price in the U.S. House, after Price’s confirmation as secretary of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump. Historically, Price’s affluent, suburban Atlanta district has been solidly Republican. However, Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the district by only 1.5 percentage points in 2016 -- well below the usual Republican performance -- giving Democrats hope that Ossoff could win the April 18 special election. Polls show Ossoff leading the multi-party field, with Republican candidates splitting the rest of the vote. If he can get to 50 percent, Ossoff could win the seat outright without having to compete in a runoff. That possibility has prompted Democrats from across the country to flood his war chest with donations. The question of Ossoff’s national security background first came up in the news release announcing his campaign on Jan. 5. "A Georgia native who grew up in the Sixth District, Ossoff served Georgia as a national security staffer in Congress for five years before leaving government for the private sector," the release reads. Ossoff, 30, continued to emphasize his experience on the campaign trail, such as in a campaign appearance and on this podcast. However, opponents raised questions about his experience, noting that Ossoff had worked on Capitol Hill between 2007 and 2012 but had only earned his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University in 2009. That would make him a pretty junior staffer to be touting his national security experience. We decided to take a closer look. The timeline After the criticism emerged, Ossoff’s campaign released a timeline of his years on Capitol Hill. Here it is: • January 2007: Starts working for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., as a part-time legislative correspondent, working 25-30 hours a week while attending Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. • May 2009: Graduates from Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. • Summer 2009: Spends the summer traveling before he returns to work as a legislative assistant for Johnson in August 2009. • January 2010: Promoted to senior legislative assistant. • April-July 2010: Runs Johnson's re-election campaign. • September 2010: Returns to Johnson's Capitol Hill office. • March 2012: Receives a top-secret security clearance and staffs Johnson for all work related to the annual National Defense Authorization Act. • Mid August 2012: Leaves Johnson's office. This timeline, which appears to match the congressional staff records we were able to find, confirms that Ossoff did indeed work as a congressional staffer for five years. Why this raises legitimate questions However, it’s important to keep in mind some important context about Ossoff’s first two years on Johnson’s staff. During those two years, Ossoff was working with the office only on a part-time basis and hadn’t received his undergraduate degree yet. Moreover, his title -- legislative correspondent -- is not exactly a lofty one. Here’s how the Congressional Management Foundation describes it: "Researches and writes legislative correspondence; conducts legislative research; assists legislative assistants as needed." In other words, the primary job of a legislative correspondent is to answer mail from the lawmaker’s constituents and to backfill for more senior office staffers when necessary. In 2009, one of the years Ossoff held the position, the median salary for a legislative correspondent was $38,875, more than the $37,504 for a staff assistant and well below the next rung up on the ladder -- legislative assistant at $50,500, according to the Congressional Research Service. And what do staff assistants do? According to the Congressional Management Foundation, a staff assistant "handles word processing, filing, faxing; responds to general constituent requests; processes tour and flag requests; staffs the front reception area, greets visitors and answers telephones." In other words, a typical legislative correspondent is getting just $1,300 a year more than the (usually equally junior) staffer manning the reception desk. Why Ossoff’s situation may have been different Ossoff’s former supervisors, however, maintain that Ossoff had substantially more responsibility than a typical legislative correspondent. Daraka Satcher, Johnson’s chief of staff from 2007 to 2009, told PolitiFact that the congressman was newly elected to the House and "was focused more on domestic issues than national security." Meanwhile, Satcher and Johnson recognized that Ossoff, with his foreign-service school background, was precocious. "Putting just any college student in that situation would be malpractice, but honestly, Jon was not a typical college student," Satcher said. "He handled the issues, so we felt very comfortable" with the unusual arrangement. Satcher said that he himself had some experience on national security issues from his previous work on Capitol Hill, so he was able to backstop Ossoff when needed. Johnson, the congressman, backed up Satcher’s description. "I had no military assets in my district and was not a military guy," Johnson told PolitiFact, "Jon’s level of information on the issue was much deeper than mine at that time. While he was a legislative correspondent, he was learning how to be a legislative assistant." Johnson’s office added that Ossoff played a key role in the House’s June 18, 2007, passage of H.Con.Res.80, a non-binding resolution about the civil war in northern Uganda. That occurred just a few months after Ossoff joined the office. Johnson said that Ossoff also handled some more mundane duties in the office, such as some information technology assignments. Still, he added, "to say that Jon staffed me on national security, that’s entirely, 100 percent correct." Is this version of events credible? Of course, in addition to being Democrats, both Johnson and Satcher have an incentive to see their former staffer win a seat in Congress. So we tried to determine independently whether the scenario they describe is plausible. We reached out to half a dozen staffers who we determined had worked for House co-sponsors of the Uganda resolution, but we did not hear back from anyone who was able to comment either way. We did, however, run everything we had learned past the staff at LegiStorm, a company founded by Jock Friedly, a former investigative and congressional reporter. The company, which is nonpartisan, collects and analyzes data about Congress. They are perhaps best known for collecting publicly available salary information about Capitol Hill staffers. Friedly and a researcher on his staff, Keturah Hetrick, pored over the available information for PolitiFact and concluded that there was nothing to contradict Ossoff’s version of events. They said that "it’s not a stretch" for Ossoff to have handled substantive foreign-policy issues despite his low-level position. "Legislative correspondents are rarely going to be the primary staffer handling a given legislative issue, but they will also handle some policy work," Hetrick said. What Johnson and Satcher said "sounds totally plausible," she said. At the same time, she added, official documentation is silent on whether Ossoff was officially Johnson’s primary foreign affairs staffer between 2007 and 2009. Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress-watcher at the American Enterprise Institute, said Ossoff’s statement amounts to "resume inflation," though, in his opinion, a "rather benign" example. "Legislative correspondent is a junior staff position, but it at least requires that the staffer know enough about his boss's policy positions that he can write letters, both to constituents and executive agencies, that are accurate and in some cases nuanced," he said. A better phrasing, Ornstein said, would have been that he spent "five years as a staffer in the U.S. Congress, including work on national security." Our ruling Ossoff said, "I've got five years of experience as a national security staffer in the U.S. Congress." This description certainly applies to his final three years on Capitol Hill, which were spent in middle- to senior-level foreign policy posts. Whether it applies to his first two years working for the lawmaker is less clear cut. His former supervisors insist that due to unusual circumstances within the office, Ossoff handled foreign-policy duties above his pay grade during that time. An independent expert told us that the explanation is plausible. That said, Ossoff at the time was an undergraduate student holding a part-time position that, in the Capitol Hill pecking order, was entry-level. That adds relevant context, and he left it out.

pomt-12019	Vermont had to "scrap" its single-payer health insurance program because it was "going bankrupt."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/20/sean-duffy/vermont-single-payer-was-scrapped-because-it-was-g/	Perturbed by technical difficulties during his Facebook Live town hall on Sept. 14, 2017, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy blamed "bad government wi-fi." But for the most part the video stream allowed the Wisconsin Republican to answer viewers’ questions. One asked his opinion of a national single-payer health care plan introduced the previous day by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran for the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. The proposal is prominently supported by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. Duffy panned it, saying: The single-payer program was tried in Vermont, where Bernie Sanders is from. They had to scrap it, it was way too much money, they were going bankrupt. It turns out Vermont was the first state to adopt single-payer legislation. But the program wasn’t going bankrupt when it was abandoned. It couldn’t. It had never been implemented at all. What single-payer is, what is its appeal Generally speaking under single-payer, everyone, or at least most people, would get health coverage from the federal government (the single payer) and it would pay all the bills. Details can vary, of course. For example, Sanders’ national proposal would eliminate nearly all private insurance. Single-payer hasn’t necessarily enjoyed widespread support. In 2014, during an interview on Milwaukee radio, four-time presidential candidate Ralph Nader said most Americans "since Harry Truman days" have supported single-payer health insurance. Our rating was False. There were individual poll results dating back to 1945 indicating majority support, but overall the results were mixed, at best. One issue is cost. As PolitiFact National reported, Sanders has pegged the cost of his national single-payer plan -- "no more copays, no more deductibles and no more fighting with insurance companies" -- at $1.38 trillion per year. Other estimates are as much as double that amount. But all of that involves single-payer at the national level. Getting back to Duffy, what happened in Sanders’ home state? The Vermont experience Vermont adopted single-payer legislation in 2011. It required then-Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, to submit a detailed financial plan by 2013. But the plan was abandoned in 2014 without ever being implemented, or even funded. Even the two news articles Duffy’s office cited to back up his statement make that clear. 1. The introduction to a National Public Radio piece that aired the day before Duffy’s statement explains it was about "why Vermont was unable to establish a single-payer health care system." Linda Blumberg, an Urban Institute health insurance and health reform expert, told NPR that leaders in Vermont determined the taxes needed "would not be politically palatable." 2. A December 2014 Politico article said that when Shumlin, who was first elected in 2010 after running on single-payer, pulled the plug he "admitted what critics had said all along: He couldn’t pay for it." We found similar reports. The Daily Beast said Shumlin dropped single-payer after an estimate said it would cost $4.3 billion a year, almost the size of the state’s entire $4.9 billion budget. The Washington Post reported that Shumlin said he could not "responsibly support" an 11.5 percent payroll tax hike on all Vermont businesses and an income tax hike of up to 9.5 percent that his administration said would be required. Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, Harvard University practice of public health professor John McDonough pointed out that the decision to drop single-payer was as much about politics as finances. While studies showed the taxes would have been high, they also showed that the plan was economically viable (as the Cornell Policy Review also noted). But when Shumlin barely was re-elected in 2014, as McDonough put it, "a clear public mandate for his health care agenda was nowhere in evidence." So, it’s clear that cost was cited as the reason Vermont did not implement single-payer, even though it was predicted that the tax revenue would have made the program viable. That’s not the same as single-payer being in place and then dumped because it was heading for bankruptcy. In fact, no one knows how single-payer in Vermont would have performed had it been put in place. Our rating Duffy said Vermont had to "scrap" its single-payer health insurance program because it was "going bankrupt." Vermont adopted legislation for single-payer in 2011. But by 2014, Vermont’s governor abandoned the plan, saying the tax increases it needed would have been too high. In short, single-payer in Vermont didn’t go bankrupt; it was never even funded or implemented. We rate Duffy’s statement False.

pomt-02471	Says Alaska Sen. Mark Begich supported President Barack Obama’s economic policies "97 percent of the time."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/21/dan-sullivan/begich-supports-97-percent-obamas-economic-policy-/	U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, a Democrat, brands himself as being "as independent as Alaska." Unsurprisingly, Republicans in the primary field for the 2014 midterm election versus Begich beg to differ. One such candidate, former state Attorney General Dan Sullivan, argued in a campaign email that Begich’s votes are in line with President Barack Obama’s positions on economic issues. "Instead of standing up to President Obama’s reckless economic policies, Mark Begich has supported them 97 percent of the time," the email read. "By rubber-stamping overspending and over-regulation, Begich and Obama are stifling our nation’s economic growth and standing in the way of job creation." Begich, Alaska’s junior senator, faces re-election for the first time in November. The leading Republican challengers are Sullivan and Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. Sullivan briefly served as attorney general. Since November 2010, he’s been commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. This is his first run for public office. PolitiFact wanted to know if Begich and Obama really agree on economic issues 97 percent of the time. Let’s crunch some numbers Sullivan’s campaign office pointed us toward CQ Weekly’s presidential position votes report. That’s from Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan outlet for congressional news and legislative tracking. That analysis shows that, out of the pool of votes where Obama "took a clear position," Begich’s vote matched the president’s stance 97 percent of the time. In 2013, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on 108 of those votes, or about 37 percent. We found the same trends across CQ reports since Begich took office in 2009. CQ put him voting with Obama over 90 percent of the time for each year served. This data looked at all votes, not just votes on economic policy. Also, all Democrats received 90 percent and higher ratings in the 2014 report. That shows that, in general, Democratic senators tend to vote with their president. CQ’s Roll Call, on the other hand, offered a different picture of Begich’s reputation in a profile of the race: "Since entering the Senate, Begich, a former Anchorage mayor, has struck an independent pitch and continues to highlight his focus on Alaska issues, even when they swim upstream from the administration’s priorities." That independence was reflected in a different congressional rating we looked at from OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service that tracks how often each senator votes with the majority of his or her caucus. OpenCongress then ranks the results within each party, giving a more detailed take on where individual senators fall on an ideological spectrum. In 2013, for example, OpenCongress said Begich voted with the majority of Democrats 87.1 percent of the time. That’s based on all 291 Senate votes. OpenCongress ranked Begich at 45th for 2013 when it comes to voting with his party. That shows that Begich is among the most independent senators currently serving. Both the CQ and OpenCongress data focus on senators’ overall voting record, not specifically on economic policy, as Sullivan’s claim said. On economic policy, Begich voted against the March 2013 Senate budget proposal passed by nearly every other Democrat. Begich has also opposed Democratic measures in favor of free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama, and legislation that would put more taxes on the oil and gas industry. "National Democrats often try to pay for something with oil and gas taxes," Begich told Politico in January. "And I have to explain that ain’t happening: That ain’t happening over my dead body." Our ruling Sullivan’s campaign email claimed Begich supports Obama’s economic policies 97 percent of the time. The statistic the campaign offered looked at all Senate legislation, not just economic policy. Most Democrats scored 90 percent or higher. In another vote analysis that ranked Democrats according to party loyalty, Begich ranked only 45th. Notably, he’s crossed his party on economic issues like yearly budgeting and oil taxes. Sullivan’s claim hinges on one statistic in a way that doesn’t accurately reflect Begich’s voting record on economic policy. We rated this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03360	The Hispanic population in Gwinnett and Henry counties has increased by 153 percent and 339 percent, respectively, since 2000 while Republican presidential candidates are getting a smaller percentage of the vote in those counties.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/15/karl-rove/hispanic-growth-georgia-counties-shows-need-better/	Karl Rove, the chief political strategist behind George W. Bush’s two White House victories, has been telling anyone who’d listen that the Republican Party must do better with nonwhites if it wants to get a Republican back in the Oval Office. Rove said that at the Georgia GOP’s convention in May, with details about how Republicans have done well among Hispanic voters in Texas by aggressively recruiting Hispanic candidates for office and conducting other outreach efforts. He offered some statistics to outline the potential trouble for Georgia Republicans if they do not employ a similar approach here. "If the GOP leaves nonwhite voters to the Democrats, then its margins in safe congressional districts and red states will dwindle — not overnight, but over years and decades," Rowe wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. "For example, the Hispanic population in Georgia's Gwinnett County increased by 153 percent from 2000 to 2010 while the GOP's presidential vote in the county dropped to 54 percent in 2012 from 63.7 percent in 2000. In Henry County, south of Atlanta, the Hispanic population increased by 339 percent over the same decade. The GOP's presidential vote dropped to 51.2 percent in 2012 from 66.4 percent in 2000. Republicans ignore changes like these at their peril." PolitiFact Georgia hadn’t seen such detailed numbers, so we wondered whether Rove was accurate and was there any context missing. Gwinnett and Henry counties had an explosion in population growth in recent decades. Gwinnett’s population has increased nearly fivefold since 1980, from 166,903 residents to the 2010 U.S. census estimate of 805,321. Henry, meanwhile, consistently made the Top 10 list of America’s fastest-growing counties in the early 2000s. Henry’s population nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010, from 119,341 to 203,923. The once-rural counties in the Atlanta area have been reliable Republican terrain in statewide and national elections, and Rove wants it to stay that way. Hispanics represent a significant portion of the population increase. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in March 2011 that Henry County’s Hispanic population had increased by 338 percent between 2000 and 2010, from 2,693 up to 11,813. Gwinnett’s Hispanic population grew from 64,136 in 2000 to 162,035 in 2010, the AJC reported. That’s an increase of nearly 153 percent. The percentage increases we found were almost the same as what Rove wrote in his op-ed. So far, so good for Rove’s claim. As for the recent performance of Republican presidential candidates, Rove was on target as well, according to our review of Georgia secretary of state records. In 2000, Bush, the Republican nominee for president, won approximately 64.2 percent of the vote in Gwinnett County. Last year, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney pulled 53.9 percent of Gwinnett voters. In Henry County, Bush garnered 66.5 percent of the vote in 2000 while Romney won 51.2 percent of the vote in 2012. Rove implies a correlation between the increase of Hispanic residents in Gwinnett and Henry and the performance of Republican presidential nominees in those counties, even though he doesn’t draw a direct connection. Most exit polls show about one-third of Hispanic voters nationwide cast their ballots for Bush in 2000, which was considered a good showing for a Republican. Bush courted Hispanic voters by speaking Spanish on the campaign trail in 2000 and distancing himself from GOP immigration positions unpopular among most Hispanics. The nonpartisan Pew Hispanic Center reported Romney did not receive the same level of support in 2012, pulling in about 27 percent of Hispanic voters. Polls showed many Hispanic voters were dismayed by Romney’s position and the Republican Party platform on immigration reform, particularly their stance on tougher border patrols. If Hispanic voters in the two counties simply liked Bush’s policies better than Romney’s, could that have accounted for the county’s overall decrease in support for the GOP in 2012? Kristin Davison, Rove’s chief of staff, referred us to past comments in which Rove said Republicans can do better with Hispanic voters with the right policies and better messaging. Census numbers, though, cast doubt on whether Hispanics had enough clout in the two counties to sway the presidential vote outcome. By 2010, Hispanics formed about a fifth of Gwinnett’s population, up from about 11 percent in 2000. In Henry County, Hispanics made up just under 6 percent of the population in 2010, compared with 2 percent in 2000. But the voting-age population of Hispanics in each county was smaller, and many Hispanic adults weren’t registered to vote. William Boone, a longtime political science professor at Clark Atlanta University, said the black vote is a critical element that must be considered when examining presidential election voting patterns in Georgia. Boone observed Rove’s lone reference to African-American voters was in the final paragraph of his op-ed. "I think what is missing from his equation is the black vote is increasing in Gwinnett, in Henry, in Rockdale (County) and throughout the state," said Boone, who noted that black voter turnout is greater than Hispanic voter turnout in Georgia. Census numbers indicate that the African-American population in the two counties was large enough and active enough at the polls that they could have had a significant influence on the presidential election. In Gwinnett, African-Americans accounted for almost 24 percent of the population in 2010, up from just over 13 percent in 2000. The number of African-American Gwinnett residents who voted tripled between the 2000 and 2012 elections, state records show. In Henry, African-Americans made up almost 37 percent of the population in 2010, up from about 15 percent in 2000. In Henry, the increase in those who voted was sixfold, records show. In 2012, the number of African-Americans who voted in those counties was 15 percent to 20 percent higher than the number of Hispanics who voted, state records show. Georgia did not track how many Hispanics voted in 2000. Exit polls found Democrat Barack Obama, the nation’s first African-American president, won about 95 percent of the black vote nationwide in 2012. Al Gore, the Democratic Party’s candidate in 2000, won 92 percent of the black vote. Davison said Rove doesn’t believe that nationwide exit poll results can be applied to specific counties. Still, Davison stressed that Rove’s overall point was that the GOP needs to do better among all racial groups. "So, if Republicans rely solely on white voters ... these counties will likely no longer be safe GOP counties as the nonwhite population continues to grow," Davison said. Rove’s numbers were either identical or very close to what our research found. But his emphasis on Hispanic numbers implied a greater influence on the election outcome in the two counties than they brought. African-American voters, who got cursory mention in his remarks, may have had a larger influence on the performance of GOP presidential candidates in those counties. That context is necessary to fully consider why GOP candidates did not do as well in Gwinnett and Henry counties. We rate Rove’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08032	Says the state's Medicaid waiver proposal "has languished in a file cabinet at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/jan/06/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-state-medicaid-proposal-has-la/	It's no secret that Texas Gov. Rick Perry thinks states can do some things better than the federal government, including coordinating health care for its poorest residents. In a Dec. 19 interview with Kathleen McKinley, whose blog appears on the Houston Chronicle's website, Perry said the state has good ideas for delivering care effectively. As an example, he pointed to a proposal that Texas submitted to the federal government with the goal of reducing the number of uninsured residents by "restructuring federal Medicaid funding." Medicaid uses federal and state funding to provide health insurance to low-income Americans. Perry went on: "Unfortunately, this waiver, which presents a strategic alternative to continued reliance on government-run health care programs, has languished in a file cabinet at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years." Perry's description of the waiver proposal's status rang a bell here at PolitiFact Texas. In the spring, we rated as False a statement Perry made in an April 15 interview with the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine that Texas has been waiting for more than two years for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to "create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today." We confirmed that Texas had sought permission from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in April 2008 to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool intended to help some low-income Texans get private insurance. However, in August 2008, during George W. Bush's presidency, an official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the federal health agency, sent a letter to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission stating that "a number of areas under this proposal have been identified as problematic" — making it impossible for the federal agency to approve the proposal as written. Since then, state and federal officials have gone back and forth, without the state submitting a revised proposal and with no ultimate resolution. A federal official told us April 22 that the ball was in the state's court, saying that as of that time, the waiver request wasn't considered complete. Our story also quoted a state official saying that the proposal would probably need to be adjusted afresh to the just-approved federal overhaul of health care. Eight months later, Perry appeared to be making the same claim, that the federal government — not the state — was responsible for the waiver request's stalled-out status. We wondered whether anything had changed since we last investigated this topic. Not from the state's perspective. "We still consider the proposal to be pending," said Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas health commission. Not from the view of the federal government, which still considers the proposal incomplete. Mary Kahn, a spokeswoman for CMS, told us that the agency had "not yet received a revised proposal from the state."

pomt-06361	A state bill would end a longstanding requirement that local governments repair highways and sidewalks -- and block injured citizens from suing over neglected maintenance.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/04/wisconsin-association-justice/wisconsin-association-justice-says-state-bill-woul/	As the 2011 Wisconsin Legislature neared completion of its work, a group of trial lawyers attacked a batch of Republican-sponsored legislation it contends will "erase basic rights." The Wisconsin Association for Justice -- formerly the Wisconsin Academy of Trial Lawyers -- railed against limits on attorneys fees in consumer cases, and immunity for doctors and drug makers in injury cases. We previously ruled Mostly True a health care advocate's claim that one of the bills "grants drug companies and medical device manufacturers immunity from injuries and deaths caused by their products." This time we’ll examine the trial lawyers’ claim in an Oct. 31, 2011, news release regarding Senate Bill 125/Assembly Bill 180. The group said the proposal "makes local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law, and injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages … The state law has been in place for 162 years." That sounds like a major change of lanes. Let’s pop the hood. First, a bit of history. Over several decades, it’s become much tougher for citizens in Wisconsin to sue and win when claiming negligence by their local units of government. How much tougher? In a 2009 Wisconsin Supreme Court opinion, Justice David Prosser, a former Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly, said that "so far as government responsibility for torts is concerned, immunity has become the rule and liability has become the rare exception." "Justice," wrote Prosser, "has been confined to a crawl space too narrow for most tort victims to fit." Generally speaking, except in cases involving unheeded warnings over dangers involving actions they absolutely should have taken, public agencies are shielded from liability. That’s because of state laws and court rulings. A notable and longstanding exception to that -- under a state "highway defects" law dating to 1849, a year after statehood -- allows up to $50,000 in civil damages when highways and sidewalks are poorly maintained and lead to vehicle damage or bodily injury. The bill up for debate would eliminate nearly all of that statute. Local governments have sought this for years, hoping to avoid what they see as the "automatic" liability for defects, and get more discretion over when and how to do highway repairs -- as state officials have. Former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle vetoed a previous attempt. Here’s what’s unique about the defective highways statute (893.83): Plaintiffs don’t have to clear the high legal bar they would in winning a case against the government over other mistakes. They don’t have to show government had an absolute duty to do the specific thing in dispute -- that duty is presumed under that existing law. Notably, the law creates a "right to recover" damages from government. Many of the cases are routinely settled before getting to court -- that’s how strong the law is. If the cases reach trial, jurors have to decide if damages stemmed from known road defects -- and whether the municipality kept the highway "reasonably safe for public travel," according to jury instructions in place since 1974. "With winter conditions, it’s awfully difficult to make sure highways are maintained every second, every hour of every day," said Andrew Phillips, a lawyer representing the Wisconsin Counties Association. Counties do most of the highway work. He’s talking about potholes and defective shoulders, among other things -- problems that have been litigated all the way to the state’s highest courts. The money stakes are not sky high, but significant: over a decade, counties served by Wisconsin County Mutual Insurance paid out $950,000 in these cases. That doesn’t include all counties, or other municipalities. Let’s turn back to the statement. Asked about its claims, the Association for Justice pointed us to the text of the bill. The bill would eliminate the liability provisions except for damages resulting from the accumulation of snow or ice that has existed on a highway for at least three weeks. The chief backers of the bill, the Wisconsin Counties Association, acknowledge that. So would that mean citizens could "no longer sue" and locals would not have a duty to repair, as the association claimed? They couldn’t sue under the highway defects statute -- but still could file a claim under a more general state law, according to Phillips, the lawyer for the counties group. Even Ann Jacobs, a personal injury lawyer speaking for the Association for Justice -- the group making the claim -- agreed. The two sides also agree localities’ legal exposure would drop if the more general state law (893.80) was the only route for plaintiffs. The bottom line: People could still sue, though under less favorable circumstances from the complainant’s viewpoint. The ultimate effect would be decided by judges. What about the second part of the claim? Would the bill eliminate the requirement that local governments repair roads? Jacobs, of the trial lawyers’ group, says it effectively does because enforcement of that duty would all but disappear without the specific liability statute. "What good is a right without a remedy?" Jacobs asked. Even the counties’ attorney, Phillips, acknowledges that county decisions on when and how to repair highways would be more discretionary with the strict liability gone. The Association for Justice, at a public hearing on the bill, made that point using this language: "Local governments would not have a general duty to maintain highways and bridges" if the bill passed. But in its public news release, the group’s claim went well past that -- leaving readers to believe road repairs would no longer be required. Phillips pointed us to Chapter 83.025 of state statutes: "The county trunk system shall be marked and maintained by the county." And for towns, 82.03: "The town board shall have the care and supervision of all highways under the town's jurisdiction." So the locals still would have the obligation to repair. Let’s patch this up and move on. A trial lawyers group contends that a bill would change a 162-year-old state law to "make local governments' repair of roads, bridges and sidewalks no longer required by state law." It continued: "Injured citizens could no longer sue them for bodily or auto damages." The bill could have a big impact on local government liability for highway problems, though just how dramatic remains to be seen. But the group’s news release went too far in flatly claiming citizens could no longer sue, and asserting that highway repairs would no longer be required. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11370	BREAKING: Trump Just Ended Welfare For One HUGE Group For 5 Years!	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/30/blog-posting/donald-trump-just-ended-welfare-immigrants-s-false/	A website claiming President Donald Trump ended welfare for immigrants ignores critical facts as much as Trump did when he announced this was his intention. "BREAKING: Trump Just Ended Welfare For One HUGE Group For 5 Years! – Let The Riots ERUPT!" said the headline of a March 29 post on americatb.com. In a nearly 1,000-word post, americatb.com recaps Trump’s desire for limits on federal benefits for immigrants, for a merit-based immigration system and for an end to "chain migration." The story itself isn’t as affirmative as its headline, claiming Trump is "about to" ban immigrants from federal benefits. "President Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years," the americatb.com post said. "The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Americatb.com doesn’t indicate who’s behind the website or what its mission is, and it doesn’t list contact information. Trump in June 2017 did say he wanted new immigration rules that would bar new immigrants from public benefits for a period of at least five years. But as we pointed out back then, there’s already a federal law that does that. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 said immigrants who entered the United States on or after Aug. 22, 1996, would not be eligible for federal "means-tested" public benefits for five years, starting on the date of their entry into the United States with a status meeting the definition of "qualified alien," which includes lawful permanent residents. The law did outline several exemptions and said certain groups were not subject to the five-year restriction, including refugees and asylees, military veterans and active-duty military members, along with their spouses and unmarried dependent children. The americatb.com post accurately cited remarks Trump made in an August 2017 weekly address: "Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy. As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country." Trump’s weekly address alluded to the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga. Their bill does include a provision to prevent immigrants admitted under their proposed skills-based points system from receiving federal means-tested public benefits for five years. But as fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org have noted, while the RAISE Act tightens eligibility requirements, many would still remain eligible. The RAISE Act’s provision also only applies to those admitted under the skills-based system, which as Cotton has said, currently represents a small fraction of immigrants legally admitted per year. (The RAISE Act also seeks to limit family-based immigration.) Americatb.com’s post mixes in opinions and hypotheticals ("Let’s say one million immigrants each get $30,000 worth of welfare benefits per year. That’s $30,000,000,000 of free welfare money sucked out of the American budget for people who put NOTHING back into our society, culture, or anything at all") but no evidence to back it’s claim that Trump "just ended welfare" for immigrants.

pomt-09424	Rubio admitted he "would have accepted the stimulus money."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/16/charlie-crist/crist-says-rubio-has-said-he-would-have-accepted-s/	It's a move straight out of the campaign playbook: If your opponent criticizes you for something, accuse him of doing the same thing. That's what Charlie Crist's campaign for U.S. Senate is trying to do to opponent Marco Rubio about supporting the $862 billion economic stimulus package. Rubio has repeatedly criticized Gov. Crist for supporting the plan, which used tax cuts and federal spending to try to jump-start the economy. Rubio has said that Crist "breathed air into the sails of the failed Democrat plan, while deflating Republican efforts to rally behind an alternative." To turn the tables, Crist's campaign issued a satirical news release written as a speech that Rubio supposedly would give to the Conservative Political Action Conference. In it, Rubio would acknowledge that he had said in a recent interview that "I would have accepted the stimulus money." The news release was satire, but the point was serious -- that Rubio said he would have accepted stimulus money. We were surprised by that because Rubio has been so critical of the stimulus, so we decided to see what he had actually said. The Crist campaign is referring to a Rubio interview by Keith Cate of WFLA-TV in Tampa on Dec. 9, 2009. Asked whether "he would not have accepted the stimulus money," Rubio said that "ultimately I would have accepted those portions of the money that would not have put Florida in a worse position off in the future than it is right now." That's not exactly a hearty endorsement, but Rubio is definitely saying that he would take at least some of the money. When the statement set off blog frenzy, the Rubio campaign tried to explain. Alex Burgos, Rubio's spokesman, told Politico that "There’s a big different (sic) between what Charlie Crist did by accepting the Obama stimulus as the best that Congress could do, actively promoting it, advocating for it among his fellow Republicans ... and what other governors ultimately did — governors like Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Sarah Palin, Haley Barbor — by reluctantly accepting federal funds after the fact." Rubio told National Journal's Hotline on Call that "advocating for the stimulus plan and accepting those dollars are not the same. The stimulus was a disaster and I would have fought it in every way possible." As far as we can tell, Rubio has been consistent with his position that there is a distinction between accepting money and actually endorsing the stimulus. Speaking with The Weekly Standard in May 2009, Rubio said that "It's one thing to say you'll accept the funds from the federal government ... it's another to actively advocate those policies, which I think are disastrous for America." And indeed, even in the aforementioned interview, when asked whether he would have attended the presidential visit from Barack Obama -- referring to a February 2009 town hall meeting in Fort Myers, which Crist attended -- Rubio said he would have avoided it "because that rally was in support of a specific plan." To recap: Crist's campaign claimed that Rubio admitted that he would have accepted the stimulus money. And indeed, in the WFLA interview, Rubio said he "would have accepted those portions of the money that would not have put Florida in a worse position off in the future than it is right now."

pomt-11274	After the minimum wage for tipped workers was raised in Maine, the state "reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/apr/26/james-tedisco/ny-may-raise-wages-tipped-workers-heres-what-happe/	New York state leaders are thinking about raising the minimum wage for workers who earn tips in addition to their hourly rate. Sen. James Tedisco, a Republican from Schenectady County, says that idea didn’t work when it was tried in Maine two years ago. "The state of Maine passed an initiative that abolished the tip credit," Tedisco wrote in a blog post, "but less than a year later reversed that decision due to restaurant employees organizing en masse against the measure after they saw a significant decrease in earnings." The state Department of Labor will decide later this year whether to end a practice that allows employers to pay tipped employees less than the state’s minimum wage. Tedisco is against the idea, saying it could do more harm than good for the state’s restaurant industry. He says restaurant workers in Maine were able to reverse an identical proposal in their state. Is he right about what happened? What’s happening in New York state The state Department of Labor is holding hearings across the state through June to consider raising the minimum wage for tipped workers. The proposal would not ban tipping. Tipped workers currently make between $7.50 and $10.85 an hour without tips depending on where they live and the industry they work in. The minimum wage for everyone else varies between $10.40 and $13.50 based on location and industry. Tips are meant to make up the difference between what tipped workers earn and the statewide minimum wage. Employers have to fill the gap if tips do not. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo believes the proposal may help employees who struggle to make the minimum wage with tips. If the Department of Labor agrees, the agency can raise the minimum wage for tipped employees without approval from voters or the state legislature. They already did once in 2015. What happened in Maine Maine tried to do the same thing in 2016 — sort of. In a 2016 ballot initiative, Maine approved increasing the state’s minimum wage as well as gradually raising the minimum wage for tipped workers until it reached $12 in 2024. The measure passed by a slim margin. By the time the new minimum wage took effect at the start of 2017, restaurant workers had already organized a campaign to restore the lower wage for tipped workers. They argued that a higher wage would give patrons less incentive to leave a tip. Fear became reality for many workers, according to Joshua Chaisson, a server in Portland, Maine, who co-founded Restaurant Workers of America to oppose the wage increase. "Individuals were coming into our restaurant and simply asking us, ‘You make minimum wage, do you still think I should tip the same percentage?’ " Chaisson said. He was one of hundreds of restaurant owners and workers who showed up at the state capitol in Maine that April for a public hearing on the wage increase. "Several of us had brought pay stubs forward from the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 showing we had actually lost money in the same identical quarter from year to year," Chaisson said. In June 2017, the Maine legislature passed a new law making the minimum wage for tipped workers half of the regular minimum wage. One of the bill's sponsors, Sen. Roger Katz, gave credit to restaurant workers for the new law. "Hundreds of restaurant workers have spoken, and we have listened," Katz said in a statement. "Over the session it has become abundantly clear that those working in the restaurant industry overwhelmingly favor the tip credit system." Our ruling Tedisco said the measure raising the minimum wage for tipped workers in Maine was reversed in less than a year. Tedisco is right. Voters in Maine raised the minimum wage for tipped workers through a ballot initiative. State lawmakers reversed that decision less than a year later after pressure from restaurant workers who were against the wage increase. We rate his claim True.

pomt-11705	Says of the diversity visa lottery program, "they give us their worst people, they put them in a bin," and "the worst of the worst" are selected.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/20/donald-trump/pick-them-bin-donald-trump-mischaracterizes-divers/	President Donald Trump's claims about bad people coming into the United States have expanded to include not just people who get here illegally, but also immigrants who arrive legally after being vetted by the U.S. government. Trump told graduates at the FBI National Academy that two recent terrorist attacks in New York City were perpetrated by individuals who came to the United States via a "dysfunctional immigration system," one through family sponsorship and the other through the diversity visa lottery program. Trump said: "They have a lottery. You pick people. Do you think the country is giving us their best people? No. What kind of a system is that? They come in by lottery. They give us their worst people, they put them in a bin, but in his hand, when he’s picking them is, really, the worst of the worst. Congratulations, you’re going to the United States. Okay. What a system — lottery system." Trump made similar comments on Dec. 20 at a Cabinet meeting: "When we take people in a lottery, they're not putting their best people in the lottery. It's common sense. They're not saying, 'Oh, let's take our best people and let's put them into the lottery so that we can send them over to the United States.' No. They put their worst people into the lottery. And that's what we get in many cases." Trump’s recent comments parallel his Pants on Fire claim as presidential candidate that the Mexican government sends "the bad ones" over to the United States. In this case, Trump oversimplified and misconstrued the program. Countries don't send their people. Lottery applicants must meet minimum standards for education or work experience. The lottery is run by the United States, not foreign countries. Lottery winners are selected by a random, computerized process. Individuals must pass background vetting by the U.S. government before getting a visa. The White House declined to comment on the record for this fact-check. Trump’s criticism of the diversity visa lottery Trump favors a merit-based immigration system where people come in based on job skills, not just because of family connections or for diversity purposes. He’s said the visa lottery "presents significant vulnerabilities to our national security" and has pointed as an example Sayfullo Saipov, from Uzbekistan, who entered the United States in 2010 through the lottery program. Saipov is accused of killing eight people and injuring a dozen other in an October vehicular attack in New York City. He’s pleaded not guilty to murder and terrorism charges. The visa lottery program was established in 1990 to diversify the United States’ immigrant population. The lottery began in 1995 and selects applicants from countries with low immigration levels during the previous five years. Diversity visas are currently capped at 50,000 per fiscal year. It's not foreign governments who run the lottery, it's administered by the U.S. State Department. Here’s its current description of the program: • Applicants register online for the lottery in the fall; • Names of lottery winners are randomly selected by a computer; • Lottery winners are notified around May that they can apply for the diversity visa; • The visa application process and interviews begin Oct. 1. This step includes extensive vetting such as biographic and biometric screening against U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism databases; • Applicants who pass the vetting process are awarded the diversity visa, which is usually valid for up to six months from date of issuance. "No visa can be issued unless all concerns raised by the screening are fully resolved. As part of this screening process, information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat is shared with all appropriate U.S. government agencies," the State Department said in a statement to PolitiFact. "National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications," the agency added. The ‘worst of the worst’? Trump’s comment that the worst are coming not only ignores vetting done by the State Department, but also lottery entry requirements of at least a high school education or its equivalent, or two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience to perform. "In countries where only a fraction of people complete secondary school, this basic criterion limits the pool of people eligible for the diversity lottery significantly," said Beth Elise Whitaker, an associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Trump said countries are not "giving us" their best people. But that's a flawed statement. Countries do not "give" immigrants, noted Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University. "Individuals make decisions to apply for any visa, including but not limited to the diversity lottery visa. The decision is a difficult one, as is the process of receiving the visa," Cohen said. "The application and vetting process are also complicated, suggesting that only highly capable and well-prepared individuals will succeed." Cohen said Trump and his administration have promoted two conflicting goals: They have attacked family reunification immigration policies, but also the diversity lottery, "which does not rely on family reunification and is far more skills-based than the name suggests." "The diversity visa program is a true lottery. There is no way a foreign government can game the lottery to offload the worst of their citizenry," Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law practice at Cornell Law School wrote in an op-ed for the New York Daily News. Our ruling Trump said of the diversity visa lottery program, "they give us their worst people, they put them in a bin," and "the worst of the worst" are selected. Trump based his criticism of the lottery program on the fact that the suspect in a New York City terror attack came through the program in 2010. But Trump’s simplistic characterization gives a misleading impression of how the process actually works. First of all, countries don't "give us" immigrants. The lottery is administered by the United States, not foreign governments. Lottery entrants must meet educational and work experience requirements, and winners are chosen at random by a computer. Also, winning the lottery does not necessarily mean the person will come to the United States. They must be thoroughly vetted before being awarded a visa. We rate Trump’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05229	The new Hartsfield-Jackson international terminal was "on time and on budget."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/06/kasim-reed/reed-airport-terminal-opened-time-and-budget/	To hear airport boosters tell it, the story of the recent completion of the new international terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson airport ends with a Happily Ever After. The Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal is one of the largest in the country, and it takes advantage of expected growth in international travel at the world’s busiest airport. Passengers will receive the best in service inside its glistening corridors, they say. When city leaders announced its opening date, they could not contain their enthusiasm. "I am . . . pleased to announce today that the Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal will open for global business and travel on Wednesday, May 16, on time and on budget," Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said during a speech in the weeks before the terminal’s opening. The audience applauded. PolitiFact Georgia grew concerned. "On time and on budget"? PolitiFact Georgia recently gave airport spokesman John Kennedy a Pants on Fire rating after he said the terminal was completed "within budget." So what about the mayor’s "on time and on budget" claim? We found that airport boosters have made a habit of describing what was a daytime drama as a fairy tale. As we’ve said before, planning for the international terminal began more than a decade ago, well before Reed took office as mayor in January 2010. Leaders hoped to double the size of the international complex. Stories printed in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in November 2000 pegged the cost at $719 million. Leaders said it could be finished as early as 2004, according to AJC stories. Those plans soon went awry. Construction prices rose, and after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, so did the price of security measures. Delta Air Lines went into bankruptcy, and the terminal’s original design team was fired because the then-general manager of the airport said its plans would bust the proposed $700 million budget. By May 2006, auditors concluded that at an estimated cost of $1 billion, the international terminal’s price tag was spiraling out of control. A year later, the expected price was as high as $1.5 billion, even though it would be 400,000 square feet smaller than planned. Now on to Reed’s "on time and on budget" claim. Reed spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs argued that the mayor’s statement is accurate because the terminal met goals established during his time in office. "Mayor Reed’s statement is true and accurate in that it reflects the city’s management of the international terminal since his inauguration on Jan. 4, 2010," Jacobs said. One month after he took office, the airlines set a budget of about $1.413 billion, an amount Jacobs said was the only true budget for the terminal. If Reed specified that the terminal met a budget goal set while he was mayor, Jacobs would have a point. But that’s not what he said. Furthermore, when top leaders say in public that they expect an airport terminal to cost $700 million, taxpayers expect it to cost $700 million -- regardless of the technicalities. Now let’s consider whether the terminal opened on time. The following account of airport delays comes from years of stories published in the AJC: The Atlanta City Council voted to name the terminal after former Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson in 2003, soon after his death. That year, it was expected to open in 2006. In May 2005, airport officials said that costs were rising for the new terminal, and its opening would be delayed until 2009. After the design team was fired, the terminal opening was delayed until 2010. But by 2009, planners projected an early 2012 opening. This date was just about right. The airport opened May 16. Reed’s claim that the terminal opened on time was correct because it began operating as the mayor promised, Jacobs said. "Mayor Reed and his administration never veered from saying that under our leadership, the international terminal would open in spring 2012. We did so," Jacobs said. It’s true that the delays did not take place under Reed’s watch, but no matter how you slice it, the terminal opened years later than originally planned. If officials say it will open in 2006, taxpayers expect it to open in 2006. Reed doesn’t deserve blame for the delays, or the cost overruns. But the mayor is accountable for the highly inaccurate claim that the terminal was finished "on time and on budget." Reed earns our lowest rating on this one, Pants on Fire.

pomt-00829	Says according to recent polls, no Republican candidate "is doing better against Hillary Clinton than myself."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/25/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-he-has-best-shot-beating-hillary-cl/	Among the potential Republican contenders, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says he is best-positioned to take on likely Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. In an interview with Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who asked about his chances at a win, Paul said, "I think when you see my polling, the polling that's out there so far, nobody is doing better against Hillary Clinton than myself." "Also though, when you poll people not just against each other, but against the other side, that shows which candidate has the best chance of picking up the independent vote," he added. "And right now I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states. I'm the only one that also scores above all the other Republicans in whether or not I can beat her." We wondered if Paul really is doing the best in polls against Clinton in a hypothetical 2016 general election match-up. Paul’s office directed us to a recent CNN/ORC poll that asked participants whether they would vote for Clinton or various Republican candidates in the general election. Indeed, more people said they would vote for Paul over Clinton than they would vote for other Republican candidates over Clinton. In a Paul-Clinton race, 43 percent said they would pick Paul, while 54 percent said they would pick Clinton, according to the CNN/ORC poll. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., came in second place behind Paul, with 42 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 55 percent. However, there are a few contextual issues we’d like to point out. First, the margin of error in the CNN poll is plus or minus three percentage points. Every Republican candidate in this poll came in between 40 percent and 43 percent against Clinton. So taking into account that three-point margin of error, the Republican candidates had more or less the same results, meaning there isn't a clear winner. Additionally, the CNN poll is only one of several polls. Of the seven polls collected by PollingReport.com, a nonpartisan public opinion site, that pit Paul against Clinton, this CNN/ORC is the only one where Paul has a lead among Republicans. This table shows results of the CNN poll and three other recent polls. The percentage that would vote for the Republican candidate is on the left, and the percentage that would vote for Clinton is on the right. The Republican with the best chance against Clinton is bolded in each column. The polls did not ask about every candidate. Candidate (vs. Clinton) CNN 3/13-15 Marist 3/1-4 Quinnipiac 2/26-3/2 Fox 1/25-27 Rand Paul 43% to 54% 40% to 51% 41% to 47% 44% to 47% Jeb Bush 40% to 55% 42% to 49% 42% to 45% 43% to 48% Chris Christie 40% to 55% n/a 39% to 46% 42% to 48% Ted Cruz n/a 39% to 53% 38% to 48% n/a Scott Walker 40% to 55% 44% to 48% 39% to 48% n/a Ben Carson 40% to 56% n/a n/a n/a Mike Huckabee 41% to 55% n/a 40% to 47% n/a Marco Rubio 42% to 55% 42% to 49% 41% to 46% n/a Rick Perry n/a 42% to 51% n/a n/a Mitt Romney n/a n/a n/a 46% to 46% As you can see, each poll has a different winner in the match-up against Clinton. So there’s no obvious frontrunner in this regard, with the possible exception of failed 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the Fox News poll, where he received the highest percentage of the vote against Clinton among all the poll results (46 percent to 46 percent). But Romney has decided not to run this cycle. Additionally, all of the Republicans are coming within a couple points of each other when compared to Clinton, such as Paul with 43 percent and Rubio with 42 percent in the CNN poll. This downplays Paul’s assertion that "nobody’s doing better" than him. "I doubt any respectable pollsters would say a single percentage point lead suggests that he is ‘doing better’ " than other candidates against Clinton, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the conservative American Enterprise Foundation. Bowman added the Republicans’ results hover around 40 percent in each of these polls because that’s about the percentage of Americans who are Republican or lean right, and it’s fair to assume that any Republican candidate will get core party support. "So, any Republican will probably get around 40 percent of the vote to start," she said, noting that it is still too early to tell which specific candidate would do best against Clinton 18 months from now. "It is probably easier at this point to see if someone is just a non-starter, if he or she is significantly below that threshold." We posed Bowman’s analysis to Paul spokeswoman Eleanor May, and she said, "We all recognize that polling data can be collected a number of different ways and can produce various outcomes. The specific poll Sen. Paul was citing, along with the outlet that conducted the poll publicly declared that Sen. Paul comes closest to beating Hillary Clinton." It’s also worth noting that in every single one of these match-ups, Clinton wins. (The one exception is the tied Romney-Clinton results in the Fox poll.) In the CNN/ORC poll that Paul cites as showing he’s got the best chance at beating Clinton, she is still ahead by 11 percentage points. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has the best chance against Clinton in the Marist poll, is behind Clinton by 4 percentage points in that poll. Our ruling Paul said that according to recent polls, no Republican candidate "is doing better against Hillary Clinton than myself." The big picture shows nearly any Republican candidate getting approximately 40 percent of the vote when matched up against Clinton, so it’s hard to argue that any particular candidate is in the lead in this regard. One poll shows Paul with the highest support among Republicans against Clinton. But the size of the margin of error allows for the possibility that Paul might, in reality, be behind other Republican candidates. Additionally that is the only poll that shows Paul with a lead. Because it’s hard to say if any candidate, so far out from the 2016 election, is the clear frontrunner in a hypothetical race against Clinton, we rate Paul’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-11768	"For years, they have not been able to get tax cuts -- many, many years, since Reagan."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-no-tax-cuts-passed-reagan/	During a speech in St. Charles, Mo., to promote Republican tax legislation in Congress, President Donald Trump tried to offer some historical context. "You know, for years, they have not been able to get tax cuts -- many, many years, since Reagan," Trump said on Nov. 29. That’s flat wrong. Under three presidents -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- Congress enacted nine tax bills worth in the tens of billions of dollars in revenue reductions over four years. Here’s the list, compiled from Treasury Department data. Year President Name Average annual revenue reduction over first four years, current dollars 1997 Bill Clinton Tax Relief Act of 1997 $13.2 billion 2001 George W. Bush Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act $74.4 billion 2002 George W. Bush Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act $28 billion 2003 George W.

Bush Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Ac $22.6 billion 2008 George W. Bush Economic Stimulus Act $33.7 billion 2009 Barack Obama American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act $76.6 billion 2012 Barack Obama American Taxpayer Relief Act $320.6 billion These measures were not obscure pieces of legislation. The list includes the two big Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, arguably the signature domestic policy achievements of his presidency. Among other things, these bills cut rates for the top bracket from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. The list also includes the extension of many of those tax cuts in advance of their scheduled expiration in 2013 under Obama -- a high-stakes legislative situation known as the "fiscal cliff." (The top-bracket rate was one that did not continue; it rose again to 39.6 percent.) Trump's statement is ridiculously wrong -- since 1997, nine major tax bills have passed with tens of billions of dollars in cuts. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-12540	"Malia Obama expelled from Harvard."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/19/blog-posting/fake-story-wrong-about-malia-obama-being-expelled-/	A story that appeared on scads of blogs claiming former President Barack Obama’s eldest daughter Malia was kicked out of Harvard University is fake news. "Breaking: Malia Obama expelled from Harvard," read the headline on an April 10, 2017, post on TheNewYorkEvening.com, a known fake news website. The same post appears almost word for word on plenty of other websites, too. Facebook users flagged the story as possibly being bogus, as part of the social media site’s efforts to curtail fake news in users’ news feeds. The post said Harvard chancellor Malcolm Little said Malia, 18, "was caught in a Boston hotel lounge vaping marijuana with friends." The school’s strict drug policy meant she was out, the article read, and the Obama family was considering filing a discrimination suit. Again, this story is fake, because there haven’t been any reports that Malia Obama was kicked out. But the post does acknowledge something that would make expulsion difficult — she isn’t going to school there yet. The White House announced in 2016 after she was accepted that Malia Obama would take a gap year before enrolling in the fall of 2017. What has she been up to since then? Things a teen with a year off would do, probably, like hang out with boys in Manhattan. As for the post’s other details, Harvard does prohibit drugs and alcohol on campus, where current students would face penalties (expelling the former first daughter seems unlikely in any event). Harvard doesn’t have a chancellor, it has a president, and her name is Drew Gilpin Faust. More importantly, the post originally appeared April 9 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org. The parody website has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." Point being, Malia wasn’t caught smoking weed in a Boston hotel, and didn’t get booted from a school she isn’t even attending yet. Don’t expect to see her having to settle for Brown anytime soon.

pomt-00451	The Trump campaign "didn’t know" that Natalia Veselnitskaya "was a representative of the Russian government. ... I don't even know if they knew she was Russian at the time."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/20/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-gets-facts-wrong-about-trump-tower-meetin/	Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s attorney, said that members of Trump’s campaign had no reason to believe a key participant in the controversial Trump Tower meeting was working on behalf of the Russian government. Giuliani even suggested they may not have known she was Russian. "You asked me did they show an intention to do anything with Russians?" Giuliani told Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd. "All they knew is that a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them. They didn't know she was a representative of the Russian government, and indeed, she's not a representative of the Russian government. So, this is much ado about nothing. "I don't even know if they knew she was Russian at the time," Giuliani added during the Aug. 19 interview. Giuliani’s claim is starkly at odds with the facts. 'Russian government attorney' Emails between Donald Trump Jr., and his father’s business associate — emails that the younger Trump himself published on Twitter — directly contradict Giuliani’s assertion. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com On June 3, 2016, Donald Trump Jr. received an email from Rob Goldstone, a business associate of Trump senior. Their correspondence set in motion the Trump Tower meeting that would take place six days later. In emails, Goldstone told the younger Trump that Moscow supported his father’s candidacy, and that a Russian government official could pass on incriminating evidence against Clinton. "The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary (Clinton) and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father," Goldstone wrote. "This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump," he added, noting that a "Russian government attorney" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr. The younger Trump replied: "If it’s what you say I love it." Trump Jr. forwarded the email chain to then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the elder Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Days later, on June 9, Trump Jr. and campaign members met with a Russian national and several others. According to reports, at least eight people attended the meeting. The key Russian national was Natalia Veselnitskaya, who Goldstone referred to in his email to Trump Jr. as a "Russian government attorney." Veselnitskaya later acknowledged having close connections with Russian prosecutors. In her capacity as an attorney, she has counted Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior government official among her clients. Veselnitskaya has denied having ever worked for the Russian government. But around the time of the meeting — and contrary to Giuliani’s claim — she entered the Trump orbit based on a promise that she was acting as a Russian government agent who could bruise the Clinton campaign. This fact may prove legally significant. While experts cautioned against drawing any premature legal conclusions, they told us the Trump Tower interaction raised serious concerns about whether U.S. federal election law was broken. Our ruling Giuliani said the Trump campaign "didn’t know" that Natalia Veselnitskaya "was a representative of the Russian government" or even Russian. Emails between Trump Jr., and his father’s business associate — emails that the younger Trump himself published — directly contradict Giuliani’s assertion. Those emails show Trump senior’s business associate Rob Goldstone telling the younger Trump that a "Russian government attorney" would be willing to meet with Trump Jr. to supply the campaign with incriminating evidence against Clinton. The younger Trump replied: "If it’s what you say I love it" — and several days later, the meeting took place. We rate this Pants on Fire!

pomt-12874	"If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/29/donald-trump/no-evidence-trump-claim-it-was-impossible-syrian-c/	On the same day as he announced a halt on entries from Syria and six other predominantly Muslim countries, President Donald Trump claimed the United States was discriminating against Christians in its refugee admission policy. Trump’s executive order declaring the ban includes an exemption for persecuted religious minorities. In an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network, Trump explained: "If you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very, very tough to get into the United States. If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible." This is a claim we heard from Trump during the 2016 election, and it’s inaccurate. Christians make up a very small fraction of Syrians admitted under the refugee program, but they have been able to enter the United States. There is no evidence that this is an outcome of discriminatory policy. Refugee admissions skew in favor of Christians in other countries. Admissions numbers From Jan. 1, 2012 (the year the first Syrian refugees began arriving) to Jan. 29, 2017, the United States admitted 19,324 refugees from Syria. According to federal data, this included 19,025 Muslims and 199 Christians. (Another 86 belonged to other religions or no religion at all.) So, right off the bat, Trump is wrong that it was "impossible" to enter the United States as a Christian. Christians do make up a small fraction of refugee admissions compared with their makeup in the overall population of Syria. (We’ll explain why that may be later.) But they did come in; it was not "impossible," as Trump said. Muslims made up about 98 percent of Syrian refugees, compared with about 87 percent of Syria’s population, as of Jan. 12, 2017, according to the CIA World Factbook. Christians, meanwhile, were 10 percent of the population but just 1 percent of refugees. (The Pew Research Center meanwhile says about 5 percent of Syrians are Christians.) This pattern, however, doesn’t exist for the other countries targeted by Trump’s ban. In some cases, the reverse is true: The proportion of Christian refugee admissions are greater than the proportion of Christians living the country. Here’s a breakdown of refugee admissions by country and religion in the time frame (Jan. 1, 2012 to Jan. 29, 2017): Christian refugees Christian population Muslim refugees Muslim population Syria 1% 10% 98% 87% Iran 49% 0.9%* 9% 99%* Iraq 26% 0.8% 71% 99% Sudan 13% 5%* 79% 91%* Somalia 0.2% 0.2%* 99.8% 99.8%* Libya 0%** 2.7% 100%** 97% Yemen 27% 0.2%* 60% 99.1%* *These figures come from the Pew Research Center’s 2015 Religion and Public Life Project, given incomplete data from the CIA World Fact Book. **The United States has accepted a total of 10 Libyan refugees from Jan. 1, 2012 to Jan. 29, 2017. Experts say no evidence of religious discrimination When we looked into Trump’s claim in July 2015, all the experts we spoke with said Trump’s accusation is off base. A year and half later, there’s still no evidence that Christians have a higher bar to clear for entry. David Martin, an immigration law expert at the University of Virginia who previously held posts at the Departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security, acknowledged that Christian Syrians make up a smaller number of admissions than they do the overall population. But he said, "there are many possible explanations and this certainly doesn’t reflect a general hostility to Christians." One possible explanation for the few number of Christian Syrians admitted, the Washington Post’s Fact-Checker reported, is an initial religious disparity at the United Nations’ refugee programs. (The long vetting process for refugees seeking entry to the United States begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee.) The UNHCR reports that 1.5 percent of the nearly 5 million Syrian refugees it has registered are Christian. Agency spokespeople have warned against speculation but suggested this may be because Syrian Christians have the means to move without seeking assistance from the United Nations. In October 2015, then-U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and current U.N. Secretary General António Guterres offered a few other theories. Christians in Syria "have been less systematically victimized than they were in Iraq," he said. "Most of the Syrian Christians have moved to Lebanon. And in Lebanon, the first thing that happened to me when I met with the Lebanese president ... when I asked him to start a resettlement program from Lebanon, (he said), don’t resettle Christians because they are vital for us." Ann Richard, then-assistant secretary of state for population refugees and migration, suggested in a congressional hearing in December 2015 that Christian Syrians aren’t looking to move out of the country. "A disproportionate number of Syrians staying in the country are Christian. Now why is this? It’s because a higher percentage of them support Assad and feel safer with him there," she said (around 2:23:50 mark). Regardless of the disparity in Syria, experts did not agree with Trump’s suggestion that Christians face additional hurdles. "The U.S. government does not discriminate on the basis of religion in refugee admission or resettlement, and if you look at refugee admissions by religion over the past 10 years, rather than just at the Syrian refugees in the past few years, there are likely more Christians than Muslims," Karen Jacobsen, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, told us previously. Martin pointed out that since 2004, Christians have made up about 46 percent of refugee admissions from Iraq. That’s disportionate to the country’s total Christian population by a factor of about 58. Geoffrey Mock, a Middle East specialist for Amnesty International USA, said Amnesty has documented a myriad of human rights violations in the refugee resettlement process, but not religious discrimination "because we haven’t see any of it from the U.S. side." Our ruling Trump said, "If you were a Muslim, you could come in, if you were a Christian, it was impossible." Hundreds of Syrian Christians have entered the United States through the refugee admissions program. Thousands more Christians from other countries targeted by Trump’s ban have also entered. During former President Barack Obama's tenure, there was no formal policy that discriminated against Christians. People who watch the refugee process closely said there was no actual discrimination against Christians, either. With nothing to support this claim, we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e1da0489-11fc-4450-bf0d-6d8317cfd7a4	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-01-29T16:50:38	2017-01-27	['Islam', 'Christian']
pomt-05298	"Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/may/21/us-chamber-commerce/chamber-commerce-claims-20-million-people-will-los/	Alan Grayson’s four-year-old quip about Republicans’ plan for healthcare reform -- remember his "die quickly" rant? -- is getting new life this election cycle. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is using it against him in a TV attack ad airing in May 2012. Grayson, who represented House District 8 until Dan Webster unseated him in 2010, is running for a new Orlando seat. The commercial is part of a broader campaign by the lobbying group targeting Democrats over their support of "Obamacare," including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. (Read our fact-checks of the Nelson ad here and here). This commercial compares Grayson to a literal broken record, repeating his explosive lines on the floor. Narrator: "Reckless politicians gave us Obamacare. Alan Grayson was one of Obamacare’s biggest cheerleaders. He’d say anything." Grayson: "Die quickly. The Republicans want you to die quickly." Narrator: "Now we learn Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage." Another record appears with Grayson’s face on it, labeled "Obamacare Unconstitutional." Narrator: "And a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional. Will Alan Grayson change his tune on Obamacare, or be the same broken record?" PolitiFact Florida fact-checked the ad’s claim that a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional and found it Mostly True. For this story we’re focused on the ad’s first claim that Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage. It’s familiar ground for us, with mixed rulings depending on the context. When Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said "as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare," we rated the statement Half True. When the chamber claimed "20 million people could lose their current coverage" -- and suggested that included seniors who rely on Medicare -- in its anti-Nelson ad, we rated it Pants on Fire! The claim in this commercial’s context is pretty straight-forward. We’ll explain. The 20-million figure is a projection from nonpartisan researchers at the Congressional Budget Office. You should know CBO has also projected the law will lead to new coverage for about 30 million uninsured Americans. The real issue here is a shift in how some people will get their health insurance. The RNC previously directed us to a March 2012 study by the CBO that aimed to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer. CBO’s best guess was that between 3 million to 5 million fewer people, on net, will obtain coverage through their employer from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. CBO supplemented its projection with four alternative scenarios. Among the scenarios: One actually resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The others resulted in a decrease of 10 million, a decrease of 12 million, and -- here it is! -- a decline of 20 million. (Read this fact-check for more details about the CBO report.) Priebus was partially accurate in his op-ed, but this is the most extreme outcome of five possible outcomes presented, and it’s not the primary estimate, which is about 5 million, or one-quarter the number Priebus offered. So Priebus -- and now the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- has engaged in cherry-picking. There’s more context to consider. Not everyone who "loses" their employer coverage will do so involuntarily. According to the CBO, some people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance "exchanges" created under the Obama health care law -- virtual marketplaces for each state where applicants will be able to compare and purchase plans that offer at least a minimum bundle of benefits. In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. So those people aren't being forced off the employers' plans; they are choosing to switch. Plus, the 20 million figure does not account for the 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before but will get coverage after passage of the law because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers. Our ruling The U.S. Chamber said, "Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage." It's a claim that is oft-repeated and much exaggerated. The chamber employs a worst-case projection by a nonpartisan research agency. The agency’s other forecasts are lower, but you wouldn’t know that from watching the ad. And unlike Priebus, the group does not specify that the type of insurance potentially affected is a specific type of insurance -- "employer-based" insurance. Plus, this 20 million estimate only counts people who receive coverage from their employer -- and not those who might receive better coverage elsewhere. Most importantly, this figure does not represent uninsured people who will get coverage because of the law. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02351	You can buy lobster with food stamps.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/21/greg-morris/food-stamp-lobster-claim-true-extent-unclear/	A food fight recently erupted in the Georgia Legislature over food stamps -- with a morsel of information tossed out by one lawmaker that was too tasty for the Truth-O-Meter to pass up. Before a Senate committee, state Rep. Greg Morris, a Republican from Vidalia, was battling for a bill he authored that would require food stamp recipients to be drug-tested. Morris was asked why no one else spoke in favor of his legislation, House Bill 772, as opposed to representatives of legal groups and other organizations who said they were against it. "What lobbyists are there for just the average worker who’s a taxpayer?" Morris said. "They’re economizing and buying inexpensive cuts of meat, when with (food stamps) you can buy lobster." So, food stamp recipients can purchase lobster. Is this true? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d put on a lobster bib and do taste-testing as we researched this claim. A medium-tail lobster costs $7 for 5 ounces at some local supermarkets, so it’s not cheap. Our bosses said lobster was not in the budget. We trudged along. Nearly one in five Georgians, about 1.7 million people, receive food stamps (a program actually called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP), and 16,000 receive welfare (called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF), according to the Georgia Department of Human Services. Many of those are children, who would not be drug-tested under the bill. A revised version of HB 772 was passed by both chambers of the Georgia Legislature on Thursday, the final day of the session. HB 772 now heads to Gov. Nathan Deal for his signature. Morris did not return a call for comment. The lawmaker’s angst may stem from several Fox News Channel reports about an aspiring musician who used the federal benefits to buy the high-end seafood. The cable outlet showed a day in the life of California resident Jason Greenslate, who was 29 and unemployed and receiving SNAP benefits when Fox News met him. His day began with surfing. Next, he discussed plans for a party with friends. After that, Greenslate made a trip to the supermarket where he bought a rainbow roll of salmon, eel and other ingredients, coconut water and lobster that Greenslate observed was "on special." The lobster he purchased appeared to have a sale price on the wrapper. Greenslate used his food stamp card at the checkout counter. "All paid for by our wonderful tax dollars," he said on camera. Greenslate later met with three friends and cooked the lobster on a grill. "EBT lobster," he said before taking a bite. Electronic Benefits Transfer is the system that transfers the federal funds to food stamp cards. The number of Americans in SNAP has more than doubled in the past decade, from about 21 million people in 2003 to nearly 48 million in 2013, U.S. Food and Drug Administration data shows. The number of SNAP recipients has risen each year since 2000. The amount of money given in benefits has more than tripled from $21 billion in 2003 to $76 billion in 2013. Greenslate said he receives about $190 a month for food stamps, which is about $60 more than the national average benefit per person. He’s been pilloried by some of the network’s commentators for what they describe as his carefree outlook on accepting federal benefits and purchasing luxury food. In a subsequent interview, Greenslate explained he’ll buy food like lobster if he can get a deal on it. "I’ll eat whatever is on sale," he said. Tales of hipsters and middle-income Americans now down on their luck buying Japanese eggplant or lemon grass with their EBT cards have been reported by news outlets in recent years. Conversely, some politicians have attempted to show the difficulty of living on food stamps by writing about the tough decisions they’ve had to make about what food to purchase. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has no restrictions on SNAP recipients buying luxury items such as steak and seafood. They also can purchase food and soft drinks that are less nutritious, such as ice cream. Alcohol, beer, cigarettes and wine are prohibited. Live animals are off the list as well. The USDA said in a 2007 report that it resisted restrictions of most foods because it says it would be difficult to regulate, considering there are more than 300,000 food products in the country. The federal agency also was worried that further restrictions would embarrass some recipients and discourage them from applying to SNAP. So are there many other food stamp recipients buying lobster? It’s unclear. Messages to the USDA were not returned. Last April, the USDA released a study of the dietary habits of some SNAP recipients once they joined the program. It found they ate more whole fruit and less of some vegetables, such as carrots. The recipients ate food with less sodium and saturated fat. It did not have a breakdown of their consumption of lobster. Most other studies found little or no change in the waistlines of recipients, contrary to thinking that food stamp use leads to obesity. Comedian Jon Stewart said Fox News is exaggerating the scope of the situation. "Congratulations on finding your food stamp abuse Bigfoot," Stewart said on his Comedy Central television show, referring to Greenslate. "That one guy you found is certainly not someone the food stamp program itself would point to as its greatest success story. But we make fun of you not for finding him, but for pretending that he somehow represents literally millions of Americans." To sum up, Morris said that you can buy lobster with food stamps. It’s unknown how many other food stamp recipients are cracking open this yummy seafood from its shell. As the Fox News video showed, there is at least one person receiving those federal benefits who bought lobster. The man did say he does so if it’s on sale. From what we’ve seen, there are few people buying such high-end items. But it is possible, just as Morris said. We rate his statement as True.

pomt-02989	Says Damascus’ disincorporation would produce "NO significant tax savings."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/18/steve-spinnett/damascus-disincorporation-would-produce-no-signifi/	For much of its nearly decade-long existence as a city, Damascus has been at war with itself. Even before voters in 2004 made Damascus Oregon’s first new city in 22 years, battle lines were being drawn. On one side were those who contended that incorporation would be the best way to ensure a strong local voice given the Metro regional government’s 2002 decision to bring thousands of acres around Damascus inside the region’s urban growth boundary. On the other were those who liked the area’s rural nature and wanted it to be left alone. Infighting has continued ever since. Lawsuits, threatened recall campaigns, mass resignations from citizen advisory panels and simmering feuds among City Council members remain commonplace. Now, Damascus’ chances of thriving as a city may be dissolving. Voters on Nov. 5 will cast ballots on Measure 3-433. If more than half of the city’s registered voters say yes, the city of 10,700 will disincorporate. Passions are running high on both sides, with lawn signs favoring one camp or the other dotting the Clackamas County countryside. Mayor Steve Spinnett opposes disincorporation. He sides with property owners, such as himself, who think maintaining the city is the best way to ensure development of their land. Among the claims he made in a Voters’ Pamphlet statement against pulling the plug is that disincorporation will produce "NO significant tax savings!" Given that pocketbook issues such as property taxes and other fees typically play critical roles in local government decisions, PolitiFact Oregon decided to see whether that’s true. The county put out a fact sheet answering some of the many technical questions arising from Measure 3-433. On the question of what happens to property taxes if Damascus incorporates, the sheet states, "There would be a net decrease." That’s because, starting with next year’s tax statements, the city’s current rate of $3.10 per $1,000 of assessed value would disappear. Damascus residents now also pay an additional $2.40 per $1,000 of assessed value to cover the services they receive from Clackamas County. That brings their current total property tax rate to $5.50. With the median Clackamas County residence valued at just over $224,000, according to the assessor’s office, that equates to an annual property tax bill of $1,232. From there, things get a bit more complicated. Subtract the $3.10 from $5.50, and you get a tax rate of $2.40. Under disincorporation, that would rise by 24 percent to $2.98 per $1,000 of assessed value since the county has a higher base tax rate in unincorporated areas. But even at the $2.98 figure, "former" Damascus residents would still end up paying 46 percent less in property taxes than they would if they continue as a municipality. That $1,232 tax bill on the median house would drop to $667. Spinnett, in a telephone interview, acknowledged that property taxes will drop at least some if voters opt for disincorporation. "Maybe it depends on your definition of the word significant," he said, referring to his Voters’ Pamphlet statement. "But, yes, when city taxes go away, you’ll see a reduction in your property taxes." But the analysis shouldn’t stop there, he said. Scrapping the city also means scrapping the handful of government-limiting features he and others fought to add to the City Charter. Those include a spending cap, no-new-tax provisions and a prohibition on city collection of the fees most cities charge to cover the cost of new development. Another 72 cents per $1,000 of assessed value could end up being tacked on, he said, if residents request annexation to the sheriff’s enhanced law enforcement district. Absent that, the County Board of Commissioners and the sheriff would need to evaluate how to respond to the loss of the $1 million a year the county now receives from Damascus for law enforcement services. Finally, he said, disincorporation would require the city to transfer its remaining cash and fixed assets to the county. Spinnett put those figures at $5.5 million and $2 million, respectively. "You add all those together, and whatever savings people might see on their property taxes is going to be largely wiped out," Spinnett said. "It’s a mixed bag, at best." Spinnett is probably correct that Clackamas County may start imposing fees for some new development in the area, but those so-called system development charges -- paid by developers -- have nothing to do with property tax collections. And while remaining city assets would, by law, be turned over to the county, "those are completely divorced from the tax rate," said Dan Chandler, the county strategic policy adviser who wrote the fact sheet. Last, although voters countywide may cast ballots sometime late next year on an increased vehicle registration fee for road maintenance, Clackamas County has shown considerable reluctance in recent years to approve anything resembling a new tax. Thus, it seems unlikely that a flood of countywide bonds, levies and local improvement districts would materialize. Simple math shows that if Damascus voters follow up their 2004 historic vote to incorporate with another historic vote to disincorporate, homeowners will see their property tax bills fall -- by 46 percent at the median level. That is a significant savings.	None	Steve Spinnett	None	None	None	2013-10-18T15:58:59	2013-09-03	['None']
pomt-09495	Bill McCollum voted four times to raise his own pay, by a total of $51,000, and earns a congressional pension worth more than $75,000 a year.	true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/24/florida-democratic-party/florida-democrats-say-mccollum-voted-raise-congres/	The 2010 Florida gubernatorial campaign intensified this week, as allies of Republican Bill McCollum and Democrat Alex Sink exchanged television ads designed to highlight aspects of their rival's record that voters might not be happy with. On Feb. 23, 2010, we analyzed an anti-Sink ad placed by the Republican Governors Association. We ruled that the ad -- focusing on her tenure as a highly compensated bank executive during a time of job losses at her company -- was Mostly True. Today we look at an anti-McCollum response ad aired by the Florida Democratic Party. The ad begins with footage of McCollum telling reporters, "I'm proud of my record of having been a congressman." A voice-over continues, "Really? Well, Bill McCollum, you cost the rest of us billions. He voted four times to raise his own pay. $51,000. Our tax money pays his congressional pension. Over $75,000 dollars a year. The national debt skyrocketed. $4.7 trillion. McCollum voted for debt-limit increases five times. Bill McCollum. Just another Washington politician Florida can't afford." We'll address the debt questions in a separate item. Here we'll tackle the issues of congressional pay raises and pensions. Congressional pay raises In a footnote to the advertisement, the Florida Democratic Party provided bill numbers and dates showing the votes that enabled congressional salaries to increase. We checked the four votes -- in 1989, 1997, 1999 and 2000 -- with roll call records and confirmed that McCollum did vote yes in all four cases. In the case of the 1989 bill -- which combined landmark ethics reforms with a pay raise of more than 30 percent over two years -- McCollum praised the bill when it was introduced, saying that it's "not about a pay raise -- it's about good government. ... It's about changing the ethical climate of Congress." As for the amount of the salary increase, the ad actually understates it. Before the 1989 vote, congressional salaries were $89,500. On Jan. 1, 2001 -- two days before McCollum's final term officially ended -- congressional salaries went up to $145,100. That's a difference of $55,600, a bit higher than the $51,000 stated in the ad. The McCollum campaign points out that on several of these votes, a majority of Florida's Democratic Congressional delegation voted the same way McCollum did, and we think that's fair context to add. But looking specifically at the Democratic ad's charge, this part of the claim is accurate. Congressional pension The pensions issue is even more straightforward. The Florida Democratic Party sent us copies of three financial disclosure forms signed by McCollum, who is 65. The first was filed in 2005, when McCollum was a candidate for state attorney general, an office he won and continues to occupy. It reports that McCollum earned $76,704 in a federal pension, which covers his service in Congress. (This is distinct from his military pension, which earned him $13,455 that year; McCollum served in the Navy and the Naval Reserve from 1969 to 1992.) His 2006 report showed a federal pension worth $77,612, while his 2008 report showed a $77,280 federal pension. All three filings showed congressional pensions worth "over $75,000 dollars a year." So this claim is accurate as well. Both claims are supported by the evidence, so we're assigning it a rating of True.

pomt-14303	"There have not been any public safety issues" in cities that allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/01/chris-sgro/equality-nc-director-no-public-safety-risks-cities/	In the fight to defend Charlotte’s anti-discrimination ordinance, supporters questioned claims that it would have been a threat to public safety. Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said many large cities have rules similar to what Charlotte proposed, before the legislature nullified it. Equality NC has since sued North Carolina to try to overturn the law. "There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities," Sgro said at a rally outside the legislature just days before Charlotte’s bill was overturned. Conservatives weren’t swayed, though. Before Charlotte’s bill was passed, and then after when it was being debated by the General Assembly and even now that is has been overturned, concerns about safety have been frequently mentioned. Mostly, opponents said opening up women’s restrooms to transgender women – people who are biologically male but identify as female – will make it easier for male sexual predators to commit crimes in bathrooms and locker rooms. Online, supporters galvanized around the motto #KeepNCSafe and sent out ads that included the phrase "don’t let our girls become victims" and "keep children safe." N.C. GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse cited "privacy and safety concerns" in attacking Attorney General Roy Cooper, who is running for governor as a Democrat, for not stepping in to stop Charlotte’s bill on his own. A popular Christian author from Charlotte, Frank Turek, wrote an article about the backlash to the law that included the line, "The danger is real from sexual predators in women’s restrooms." On Thursday, the N.C. GOP distributed his column via email and bolded that sentence about sexual predators. So who is right? The evidence is overwhelmingly on Sgro’s side. That’s not to say that people don’t have honest concerns over privacy or mental anguish. Indeed, several opponents of Charlotte’s ordinance have spoken of their own experiences with sexual assault, and their fears that seeing someone with male genitalia in a women’s room might trigger painful memories. But still, Sgro said, Charlotte’s bill would not have legalized sexual assault, harassment or voyeurism – it just would’ve let transgender men and women use the bathrooms they’re more comfortable in. "Transgender people are not predators," he said. Examples to prove Sgro wrong? The entire state of Maryland and some of the largest cities in the country, including New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Seattle and Austin, Texas, have rules banning discrimination against transgender people in public accommodation, including bathrooms. More than 200 cities and counties also ban workplace discrimination against transgender people. A dozen state public school systems and dozens of college campuses also have ordinances banning discrimination against transgender people, including in bathrooms. We asked the N.C. GOP if they could point to anything that backs up the safety fears. They provided a link to a news story in Seattle from earlier this year, about a man who had twice gone into a women’s locker room and began undressing. Seattle does allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. The man didn’t identify as transgender and didn’t appear to present as a woman, the story said. No one called the police, and the man wasn’t charged with any crime. Follow-up stories described the incident as a stunt, perhaps politically motivated. The liberal group Media Matters For America has studied the bathroom issue for several years, largely under the guidance of Carlos Maza. Maza, a Wake Forest University graduate, tweeted after North Carolina’s new law passed that "A man has never used an LGBT non-discrimination law to sneak into a bathroom." Maza has also polled public school systems that allow transgender students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. In a June 2015 article, he wrote that in 17 districts with a total of 600,00 students, officials hadn’t reported a single incident of "harassment or inappropriate behavior" related to transgender students and bathrooms. But we still weren’t satisfied, so we kept digging, looking for examples of proven criminal behavior. We were likewise unable to find any examples in the United States, though we did find a case in Canada. In that case, Christopher Hambrook posed as a woman to gain entry to women’s shelters, where he attacked several people before being caught. Hambrook was sentenced to an "indefinite" jail term in 2014 that could lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison. Hambrook committed the crimes in Toronto, which has an ordinance protecting transgender people. That appears to be the first, and so far only, incident of its kind in North America. After spending hours combing through conservative blogs and family values websites dedicated to news about transgender bathroom ordinances, we were able to confirm three cases in the United States in the last 17 years in which a biological male was convicted of a crime that involved him in a women’s bathroom or locker room and dressed as a woman. It’s unclear if any of the three identified as transgender women, but none of those cases happened in cities where it would’ve been legal for a transgender woman to use the women’s room anyway. And none involved sexual assault or rape. In 1999, Patrick Hagan was convicted in Tampa, Fla., for punching a woman in a bar bathroom during an argument. In 2010, Norwood Burns was convicted in Gordon County, Georgia, for exposing himself in a Walmart bathroom. In 2011, Thomas Lee Benson was convicted of trespassing in a Clackamas, Oregon, women’s locker room and trying to talk to children. Again, though, none of those crimes occurred in places where biological men would’ve had any legal claim to being in a women’s room by virtue of being a transgender woman. The blogs did identify a few examples of alleged criminal activity having taken place under the guise of transgender-friendly bathrooms laws, but we couldn’t find proof of any convictions in those cases. Our ruling Chris Sgro, the executive director of Equality NC, said that "There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities" with ordinances allowing transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. We haven’t found any instances of criminals convicted of using transgender protections as cover in the United States. Neither have any left-wing groups or right-wing groups. There was one incident in Canada, involving a rapist. In the U.S., there have been a few yet-unproven allegations. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-15330	"The $5 billion website for Obamacare … never worked. Still doesn't work."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-5-billion-website-obamacare-neve/	Donald Trump, the celebrity businessman who has shaken up the Republican presidential race, has been attacking both Republicans and Democrats in his speeches and interviews. At one point in a July 11, 2015, speech in Phoenix, he took aim at the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. He singled out the healthcare.gov website, which was unveiled in the fall of 2013 with a panoply of bugs and glitches, calling it "the $5 billion website for Obamacare, which never worked. Still doesn't work." It’s a year and a half after the website’s troubled launch, and it’s been awhile since we’ve taken a look at how the website is doing and what it has cost to build. So we decided to see if Trump has any basis either for saying that the healthcare.gov website cost $5 billion or that it "still doesn’t work." (Trump’s camp didn’t respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact.) Let’s take each of these claims in turn. Did the website cost $5 billion? The cost of the website has been a bone of contention ever since its launch, partly because federal contracting is complex, involving some 60 major contracts. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker grappled with this question over the course of two separate reports that included several interim updates as new data surfaced. Officially, the Department of Health and Human Services says the website cost $834 million. That’s the number offered by then-HHS Secretary-designate Sylvia Mathews Burwell at a Senate hearing on May 8, 2014. As of Feb. 28, 2014, Burwell told lawmakers, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- the part of HHS responsible for the website -- "has obligated a total of approximately $834 million on marketplace-related (information technology) contracts and interagency agreements." Not everyone has taken that figure at face value. Bloomberg Government undertook a study that used a more generous definition of the relevant federal spending. In the study, released in September 2014, researchers included several additional costs beyond the government’s official estimate -- $387 million in spending by the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies beyond HHS, as well as a $300 million contract to process paper applications, and additional spending by HHS after the cutoff for Burwell’s estimate. Using this broader net, Bloomberg Government came up with a figure of $2.1 billion. That’s bigger than the official estimate, but it’s still not as large as what Trump said. We asked the Bloomberg Government study’s author, Peter Gosselin, whether he thought the number could have more than doubled to $5 billion since the study was released 10 months ago. He was skeptical, saying that even if you add on a five-year follow-up contract with the firm Accenture, it should "only get you about halfway to $5 billion." So Trump’s figure seems exaggerated. However, we have a hunch about where it came from, and while it’s wrong, it’s easy to see how someone could have made the mistake. Using a provision of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government has spent nearly $5 billion in a series of grants to states to establish health care exchanges, according to tabulations made by both the Congressional Research Service and the Kaiser Family Foundation. This $5 billion statistic was widely reported and pops up easily during Google searches. This would seem to suggest that the government had spent $5 billion on healthcare.gov. But that’s not quite correct, experts told PolitiFact. Rather, these grants were designed to boost state efforts under the law -- not the federal site -- and paid for a wide variety of things other than websites, including helping insurers prepare to join the exchanges, offering assistance through telephone hotlines, establishing marketing and outreach efforts for potential beneficiaries, and hiring "navigators" who help beneficiaries obtain care. Both Gosselin and Jennifer Tolbert, the director of state health reform at the Kaiser Family Foundation, agreed that it would be incorrect to simply assume that the $5 billion in health insurance exchange grants is tantamount to spending on the website in the way Trump expressed it. "It’s a different pot of money," Tolbert said. "It’s entirely separate from the money used to build the healthcare.gov website." Is it true that healthcare.gov 'still doesn’t work'? This part of Trump’s claim is easier to debunk. The proof is in the millions of Americans who have used the healthcare.gov website to obtain insurance coverage. According to the most recent data released by HHS, covering the open-enrollment period between November 2014 to February 2015, a total of 11.7 million Americans selected or were automatically enrolled in an insurance plan for 2015 using the online marketplaces. Of that, 8.84 million signed up through the federal marketplace -- healthcare.gov -- with the remainder signing up through state-run websites. (These figures are not limited to those who have already made their first premium payment.) So, clearly, the site is working. This isn’t to say the system is working 100 percent perfectly. "There are some remaining issues, especially for certain populations, such as immigrants and people for whom it's difficult to verify their identity or income using electronic data," Tolbert said. "This can include people who have not been in the country very long or who haven’t yet worked long enough to establish a work and income history." Still, the site appears to be functioning well in most cases. "Since the troublesome launch of healthcare.gov, (the government) has taken various actions to address the problems that impeded the initial use of the website and its supporting systems," the Government Accountability Office, Congress’ investigative arm, concluded in a March 2015 report. "Operationally, the website works for the most part," said Tolbert of Kaiser. "It’s in much better shape than it was during the first few months of open enrollment." Our ruling Trump said "the $5 billion website for Obamacare … never worked. Still doesn't work." But experts say that, using the most reasonable definitions, Trump overstates the amount of money spent to create and fix healthcare.gov, and his claim that the website isn’t working -- and never did -- is debunked by the fact that millions of Americans have signed up for insurance through the site, even if some more limited glitches remain. We rate the claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-07-14T15:00:00	2015-07-11	['None']
pomt-04151	"Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines: there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting, and three for bird hunting."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/dec/28/ginny-burdick/are-there-cartridge-limits-large-game-bird-hunting/	The morning after a gunman killed two people and wounded a third at a Clackamas mall, state Sen. Ginny Burdick sent an email to colleagues saying that she planned to introduce legislation to limit the sale of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The shooter, according to news reports, had been able to fire multiple rounds before his gun jammed. "Even hunters are restricted from using large capacity magazines: there is a five cartridge limit for large game hunting, and three for bird hunting," wrote the Portland Democrat, a longtime advocate of gun control. "If we limit capacity for hunting animals, why do we not extend that principle to guns that may harm our neighbors?" Lobbyists for gun shop owners and firearms advocacy groups immediately pounced on her idea, saying that a prohibition on magazine capacity would not stop future shootings. They called Burdick’s proposal terrible, and opportunistic too. It’s not the job of PolitiFact Oregon to make a ruling on firearms regulations or policy. So we won’t. But we were curious about the numbers in Burdick’s statement and felt it appropriate to check: Does Oregon have a five-cartridge limit for large game hunters, and three for birds? We turned to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which licenses and regulates hunting and fishing on public and private land. Agency spokesman David Lane confirmed that the state senator is correct. There are limits, after which the hunter or shooter would need to reload cartridges or shots. "It is both for social and for biological reasons," Lane said. "The social being that when somebody takes aim at an animal, they use their shots judiciously … they’re not indiscriminately shooting with the possibility of hitting other animals. It’s a wounded loss issue." Now, what Burdick is proposing regarding magazines is not new. We had a federal weapons ban for a decade before it expired in 2004. Part of that law limited magazines to 10 rounds. Burdick told PolitiFact Oregon that a shooter can be taken down in the few seconds needed to reload. "It’s simple. It’s clear, and I think it would do some good," she said of her proposal. We could stop here, but we know you love information as much as we do. So we reached out to Kevin Starrett, as well. He is executive director of the Oregon Firearms Federation, a group that calls itself Oregon’s "only no compromise gun lobby." In a spirited interview, he batted the 10-round limit as arbitrary and said reloading magazines can be quick and easy. He said there are countless reasons why a person would want a 30-round magazine, including for sport shooting and to defend themselves and others when trouble breaks. Like someone trying to stop another school or shopping mall shooting. Would you want a limit on rounds then? he asked rhetorically. That’s a question for policy makers, not fact checkers. There are limits on how hunters shoot wildlife and game in Oregon, even if there are people who think that should have no bearing on the right to bear arms. Burdick’s statement is accurate. We rate her statement True.	None	Ginny Burdick	None	None	None	2012-12-28T00:00:00	2012-12-12	['None']
pomt-02808	"Black people kill more black people every six months than the KKK did in 86 years."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/27/allen-west/allen-west-more-black-black-murders-six-months-86-/	Some claims just catch the eye and Fox News contributor Allen West delivered one on his personal blog this week. "Black people kill more black people every six months than the KKK did in 86 years," West, a former one-term congressman from Florida, wrote. We decided to see if the numbers back West up. West’s office directed us to an item from Kevin Jackson who blogs at Black Sphere. Jackson wrote about "Dixiecrats who hated black people, and who were responsible for the 3,446 deaths by the Klan in 86 years." For the moment, let’s assume that number is correct and compare it to the data on black homicide victims. Here we need to make an estimate so we’ll walk through our process. The Uniform Crime Reports gathered by the FBI show that 2,412 blacks died at the hand of another black person in 2012. That is the total for the year (not six months), but that number omits homicides where the race of the murderer is unknown. That is a huge data gap that somewhat complicates matters. The same FBI data, however, shows that most deaths occur within the same racial group. According to 2012 data, 91 percent of black deaths were caused by black criminals and 84 percent of white homicides were committed by whites. The total number of black homicides in 2012 was 6,454, according to the FBI. If the percentages hold, that would mean 5,874 homicides were committed by black criminals in all of 2012, or roughly 2,936 in a six-month span. Race of victim Total homicides Total-Race known White offender Black offender White 5,855 3,128 2,614 431 Black 6,454 2,648 193 2,412 Source: Uniform Crime Reports 2012 On its face, West’s claim is wrong but not by a huge amount, and in previous years, he would have been closer. The number of black homicides has fallen steadily over the past seven years. If we had run the numbers in 2006, he would have been about 100 deaths short of being correct. As it is, he is off by about 15 percent. But West’s claim has another error. The source West cites, Kevin Jackson, blames the Klan, but when Jackson emailed us with his source, an article on the conservative website Townhall.com, we found something a bit different. The article said "According to a Tuskegee Institute study, between the years 1882 and 1968, 3,446 blacks were lynched at the hands of whites." It did not name the Ku Klux Klan and talked only of lynching, not all homicides. The Tuskegee Institute -- now Tuskegee University -- started documenting lynching cases in the 1890s, according to Richard Sutch, an editor of the Historical Statistics of the United States. The work is generally considered accurate, as Sutch told NPR. "Many historians approached that data very skeptically," Sutch said. So scholars "went back and they literally read every newspaper in a chosen southern state, and said we're going to record every instance of lynchings that are reported in these newspapers, and then they marched state by state by state. "And what they found was not that the Tuskegee figures were wrong, but that the Tuskegee figures were essentially correct, and this amazed some people because the Tuskegee figures were showing that there were as many as 120, 150 lynchings per year in the southern United States. That's a lynching every week, more than once a week. It's just a steady drumbeat of violent oppression." We found copies of the Tuskegee work that confirms between 3,445 and 3,446 black documented lynchings (and another 1,300 lynchings of whites.) The archive, however, does not track KKK involvement. There is no question that blacks were at least twice as likely as whites to be the victims of lynchings, nor is there any doubt that the southern states accounted for most of these deaths. One study put the southern share at 90 percent. That doesn’t mean the Klan was behind them. On that point, the historical record is unclear. For starters, historian Michael Pfeifer at the City University of New York says the Klan had three phases. Pfeifer wrote a book on mob violence, Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1847-1947. "We simply don’t have good statistics on how many African Americans the Ku Klux Klan murdered in the 1860s and 1870s when the 'first' Klan was active," Pfeifer told PunditFact. "Evidence suggests, though, that the Reconstruction Klan murdered hundreds and perhaps several thousand blacks." That would seem to push the Klan death toll even higher, but Pfeifer says there’s reason to question the Klan’s role in the decades that followed. "The Klan was not active during most of the years of the ‘lynching frenzy’ of the late 19th and early 20th century South," Pfeifer said. "White lynchers in the Jim Crow-era from the 1890s through the 1910s carried on many of the same white supremacist values as the Ku Klux Klan had in the 1860s and 1870s, but it is not accurate to say that the Klan was involved in lynching in the 1890s and early 1900s." The Ku Klux Klan is a potent symbol of racism but the deadly violence against blacks, and, we should note, against more than 1,000 Jews, Catholics and other whites, came from a much wider group of Southern society in that period. Our ruling West said black people kill more blacks in six months than the KKK did in 86 years. Based on the evidence West provided, the claim essentially boils down to a comparison between the number of black-on-black homicides and the number of lynchings from 1882-1968. Using 2012 FBI data and information from the Tuskegee Institute -- neither of which is perfect -- West is somewhat off in his numbers. There were approximately 2,936 black-on-black homicides in six months of 2012 and 3,446 black lynchings from 1882-1896. But West also is wrong to ascribe the historical killing of blacks to the Ku Klux Klan, experts told us. There is no clear tally of Klan murders. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-01606	The prosecutor who brought the indictment of Texas Gov. Rick Perry "has ties to Obama. He has ties to the Democrats."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/31/tom-delay/tom-delay-says-prosecutor-who-brought-rick-perry-i/	CNN State of the Union host Candy Crowley consulted an interesting source to discuss Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s indictment on charges of abusing his power: former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a fellow Texas Republican who has been embroiled in a criminal election law violation for the past 12 years. Perry’s charges are nothing short of a political witch hunt, DeLay said, just like his own. Crowley pushed back on the suggestion. "The point is the prosecutor who brought the indictment is not a Democrat in any way anybody can see, and in fact has ties to Republicans," Crowley said. "That’s not true. Candy, that’s not true," DeLay said. "He has ties to Obama. He has ties to the Democrats." "And he has ties to Republicans, yes?" Crowley asked. "Well yeah, but that has nothing to do with this," DeLay said. "What has to do with this is you take a law and you twist it so you can get the indictment. That is prosecutorial misconduct, whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat." We wanted to look into the special prosecutor’s political connections, since Crowley and DeLay seemed to be on different pages. True colors The special prosecutor, who was not identified on air, is San Antonio lawyer Michael McCrum. A grand jury indicted Perry based on charges brought forth by McCrum that Perry misused his power, after Perry threatened to veto the budget of an Austin prosecutor if she did not resign after her DUI was caught on tape. Our partners at PolitiFact Texas laid out the legal history of the case against Perry, noting how the prosecutor, Lehmberg, recused herself from the case, and the public integrity unit she leads was uninvolved in picking McCrum. McCrum was selected by Judge Bert Richardson, a Republican appointee of President George W. Bush. Richardson and McCrum both worked as prosecutors in San Antonio, according to the Texas Tribune. McCrum has been tight-lipped in press accounts and did not respond to our request for an interview. Solomon Wisenberg, a former Texas prosecutor who worked with McCrum and considers him an "old friend," called the allegation against McCrum "pathetic on its face." "Mike would not be engaged in a political witch hunt. The idea that he’s politically motivated is ridiculous," Wisenberg said. "I don’t really consider him as a political person." The records show McCrum has steered clear of partisanship, even as he has attracted support from both sides of the aisle over 25 years. In 1989, McCrum served as a federal prosecutor in the Western District of Texas, according to his resume. In 2000, McCrum opened his own private practice in San Antonio, focusing on criminal defense. In 2009, President Barack Obama nominated McCrum to be the U.S. attorney in San Antonio, according to the Texas Tribune. His nomination was called a "consensus choice" by justice trade publication Main Justice, and Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison and House Democrats supported McCrum for the job. But McCrum withdrew his name in 2010, as the prolonged nomination process stalled his law practice, according to the Wall Street Journal. The White House did not provide comment. McCrum does not appear to vote in primaries and has donated to candidates of both parties. The Austin-American Statesman detailed McCrum’s political donations: In 2007, he contributed $300 to a Republican 4th Court of Appeals candidate, $500 to a former Democratic congressman, and $500 to Republican Bert Richardson’s unsuccessful re-election bid as state district judge. This record of bipartisanship is not unusual nor undesired in special prosecutors, said Wisenberg, who considers himself a conservative and opposes the prosecution against DeLay. He pointed out that special prosecutor Ken Starr, famous for investigating President Bill Clinton, also had ties to both parties, and DeLay did not oppose him. The ruling DeLay said it’s "not true" that McCrum isn’t a Democrat, saying "he has ties to Obama (and) he has ties to Democrats." McCrum has loose ties to Obama and Democrats -- and he has Republican ones, too. News reports and McCrum’s political record show he is not expressly partisan, having contributing a few hundred dollars to a few people on both sides of the aisle. There's a sliver of truth in DeLay's statement, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12029	Democrats "setup" and "manipulated" the political violence in Charlottesville	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2017/sep/15/dana-rohrabacher/rohrabacher-repeats-bogus-claim-democrats-orchestr/	California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Orange County, repeated a debunked conspiracy theory this week that top Democrats "setup" and "manipulated" the political violence at last month’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. In August, PolitiFact national took a deep look at this inflammatory claim, which started with controversial commentator Alex Jones of Infowars.com. Jones said emails show Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and billionaire investor George Soros instigated and orchestrated racial protests in Charlottesville by trying to "control" and keep people "desperate." After an exhaustive examination of relevant leaked emails, it found no evidence of Jones’ theory and rated it Pants On Fire, the most severe false rating. See the full fact check here. The violence in Charlottesville culminated with the death of Heather D. Heyer, 32. She was killed and at least 19 others were injured after the driver of a Dodge Challenger drove into a crowd of people protesting the rally. Authorities charged a 20-year-old man from Ohio, James A. Fields Jr., with second-degree murder. Fields had marched in the white nationalist rally. Rohrabacher, a 15-term congressman and former speechwriter for President Reagan, has garnered controversy in recent months for his pro-Russia stance amid intelligence findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election. Democrats have targeted his congressional seat in 2018. Rohrabacher’s claim Below are Rohrabacher’s conspiracy theory comments made in a San Francisco Chronicle article on Sept. 14, 2017. The article says Rohrabacher is "deep" into the theory that "Democrats were behind last month’s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va." Under Rohrabacher’s scenario, a former "Hillary and Bernie supporter" got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there. "It was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors," Rohrabacher said. "It was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation" and to "put our president on the spot." PolitiFact California asked Rohrabacher’s spokesman Ken Grubbs for any evidence supporting the claim. Grubbs told us the congressman saw a FoxNews.com article in which Jason Kessler, the organizer of the "Unite the Right" white nationalist rally says "he voted for Obama and was involved in Occupy Wall Street." The article says Kessler voted for Obama in 2008 and "once attended an Occupy Wall Street rally in Charlottesville." It offers no evidence -- nor does it even discuss the idea -- that Democrats "setup" a group of "Civil War re-enactors" and manipulated a confrontation, as Rohrabacher claims. PolitiFact’s conclusion PolitiFact national found Jones’ comments were part of a broader accusation that the events in Charlottesville were staged by liberals and coordinated by top Democrats. It found no evidence that Jones’ broad attack, or his specific claim about comments made by Soros, Clinton or Democrats in emails, checks out. PolitiFact rated his claim Pants on Fire. PolitiFact California, after examining the same facts, found California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Orange County, doubled-down on the same bogus claim. We rate his claim Pants On Fire, as well.

pomt-08984	"Since February 2009, our economy has lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs while the federal government has grown by more than 400,000 jobs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/15/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-has-presided-over-private-/	As the House Republican leader, Ohio’s John Boehner seizes every opportunity to counter any message that President Barack Obama attempts to convey. When Obama touted his efforts to resuscitate the economy during a July 8, 2010, appearance in Kansas City, Missouri, Boehner posted his counterpoint titled "Where are the Jobs, Mr. President?" in a column on the conservative TownHall website. And, on the day Obama was scheduled to speak at an electric battery plant in Holland, Mich., he hit back again with an op-ed in the Detroit News July 15. "Since February 2009 (when the economic stimulus bill was passed) our economy has lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs while the federal government has grown by more than 400,000 jobs," Boehner wrote. With the administration simultaneously putting a more favorable spin on its record of job creation, we thought it would be worth checking each side's facts. Boehner’s office said his column was based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases monthly figures on nationwide employment and unemployment. We'll take Boehner's two claims in order. • Has the economy lost roughly 3 million private sector jobs since February 2009? Yes. First we should note that Boehner was specific about the statistic he was using -- private-sector jobs, not total jobs. So we’ve used that statistic to judge his claim. According to BLS, 110,961,000 Americans were employed in the private sector in January 2009. By June 2010 -- the most recent month available -- that number had fallen to 107,700,000. That's a drop of 3.26 million jobs -- or "roughly 3 million" in Boehner’s words. By beginning his count in January 2009 -- even though the bill was passed in February 2009 -- Boehner’s number takes into account all the job losses from February. You could instead start counting in February 2009; in that case, the number of jobs lost would be somewhat further from Boehner’s claim -- 2.55 million jobs. It’s worth noting that the biggest job hemorrhages came in February and March of 2009, when 726,000 and 753,000 jobs disappeared. The losses slowed down into last summer and fall, and gains were recorded for the first five months of 2010. • Has the federal government payroll grown by more than 400,000 jobs since February 2009? Yes -- but with a major asterisk. In January 2009, there were 2,803,000 federal employees. By June 2010, there were 3,208,000 -- an increase of 405,000. Here's the asterisk: The June numbers are inflated by temporary Census workers whose jobs are slated to end in a matter of months. By way of comparison, we used BLS estimates of the temporary Census work force to adjust the monthly employment figures. Doing so drops the January 2009 federal employment level by 5,000 to 2,798,000, while the June 2010 level drops by 339,000 to 2,869,000. That reduces the federal employment increase to 71,000 -- far less than the 400,000 Boehner cited. While technically accurate, Boehner's statistics are misleading because the government workforce is inflated by the temporary census workers. For this reason, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-03304	"I was banned from talking about" Bill Ayers during the 2008 presidential campaign.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/30/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-gop-banned-mention-ayers-08/	Sarah Palin still speaks bitterly about 2008. The former Republican vice-presidential candidate spoke on Fox News recently about current matters such as the raid on the American diplomatic outpost in Libya and the IRS vetting of nonprofit applications when she turned back to the 2008 presidential campaign. "I was banned from talking about Jeremiah Wright and Obama's friend, Bill Ayers, the character that he befriended and kicked off his political campaign in the guy's living room," Palin said. "Couldn't talk about that." Palin pointed a finger at who she thought was to blame. "I was not allowed to talk about things like that because those elitists, those who are the brainiacs in the GOP machine running John McCain's campaign at the time, said that the media would eat us alive if we brought up these things." For those who might not remember, Bill Ayers lived in Barack Obama’s Chicago neighborhood and was an early supporter when Obama first ran for the Illinois state Senate. What made Ayers interesting in 2008 was that in the 1960s, he was one of the founders of the Weather Underground, a group that was responsible for bombings at a New York City police station, the Capitol, and the Pentagon. There were no injuries. Obama’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, brought up Ayers during the primary, but the issue failed to gain much traction. When Palin said she was banned from mentioning Ayers, we at PolitiFact were a bit surprised. That’s because we fact-checked her claim about Ayers in early October 2008. We had video of Palin talking about him at a rally in Clearwater, Fla. Three days before, the New York Times had carried a front-page story about Obama and Ayers; Palin mentioned the story. "He was a domestic terrorist," Palin said. "And part of a group that, quote, ‘launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.’ Wow. "And there’s even more to the story," Palin said. "Barack Obama said Ayers was just someone in the neighborhood. But that’s less than truthful. His own top adviser said they were, quote, ‘certainly friendly.’ In fact, Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’ home. And they’ve worked together on various projects in Chicago." Back then, we rated Palin’s statement Mostly True. Was this a case of Palin going rogue? Not likely. About a week later, McCain himself raised the shadow of Ayers briefly during his final debate with Obama. "Mr. Ayers, I don't care about an old washed-up terrorist. But as Sen. Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship," McCain said. The final proof that none of this was off-the-cuff and in fact was coming from those "braniacs in the GOP machine" as Palin put it, came in the form of robo-calls. On Oct. 18, 2008, the Washington Post reported that voters in Virginia, Ohio and Florida were picking up the phone and hearing this from the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee. "Hello. I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home and killed Americans." It’s possible that Palin had wanted to talk about Ayers earlier in the campaign. We reached out to her Political Action Committee for clarification but did not hear back. But her words on Fox News gave no indication of anything but a ban. Our ruling Palin said she was banned from talking about one-time domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, but the record shows the complete and utter opposite. Not only did Palin talk about Ayers, so did the man at the top of the ticket, as did a recorded message from the RNC that went out to voters in battleground states. When the public record and the candidate’s own words speak so strongly against a statement, we have little choice. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-13427	Says "Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!"	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/sep/20/americans-prosperity-florida/us-rep-patrick-murphys-policies-will-raise-utility/	An anti-regulation group is accusing U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of wanting to use the Senate to adopt policies that would raise the cost of just about everything, starting with your utility bills. "Vote against Patrick Murphy," reads a mailer we received Sept. 12, 2016, from Americans for Prosperity Florida. "We can’t afford his ‘Pay More’ agenda." The flier cautions electricity and grocery prices will go up as wages go down with Murphy in the Senate. "Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!" the flier warns. The group behind the attack is the Florida affiliate of the main political committee for the anti-tax industrialists and billionaires Charles and David Koch. We wondered just what Murphy would be planning that would make utility costs go up $500 annually. There’s a tenuous link between what the Jupiter Democrat supports and the future of energy costs, but it’s not nearly as charged as AFP claimed. Shockingly high The "Pay More" Murphy nickname, which is being used by AFP in other attacks, is borne of Murphy’s support for President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The plan was a proposed environmental rule announced by the White House in August 2015. The new regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. (A 2014 draft of the plan had sought a 30 percent reduction. We’ll get back to why this is important in a moment.) The idea was largely to promote cleaner sources of energy than coal-fired power plants, fostering more renewable energy while pushing utilities to upgrade existing infrastructure. But the U.S. Supreme Court put the rule on hold on Feb. 9, 2016, in the face of opposition from corporations and industry groups. Murphy has publicly supported its implementation, signing an amicus brief supporting the plan and calling the court’s decision to block the rule "misguided." But as a congressman, Murphy has no direct say over the fate of the final rule, which was created by the Obama administration and would be enacted by the Environmental Protection Agency. So what’s this about surging utility prices? Critics of the Clean Power Plan say it would be expensive for utilities to comply with the new emissions standards, and those costs would be passed on to consumers. An array of reports that examine just how much customers may end up paying resulted. AFP’s mailer points to one specific study from a firm called Energy Ventures Analysis. That study said that by 2020, the average Floridian’s annual gas and electric bills could potentially go up by a combined $464 from what they were in 2012. AFP rounded that up to $500, and made the connection that since Murphy supports the plan, he wants your bill to go up. That’s already a stretch, since Murphy has little to do with the Clean Power Plan. But there’s much more to all these analyses, which make a wide range of assertions about how the plan could affect utility customers. Energy Ventures Analysis’ estimate is near the top end of the scale, but the firm told us it’s already outdated. The analysis was done on the proposed Clean Power Plan from 2014 we mentioned before. Revisions have been made to the rule since the initial proposal. A lot has happened in the energy sector since then. Gas prices have dropped, utility rates have changed, electricity demand has largely decreased, and solar and wind energy is in wider use today, among other factors. "If they (AFP) are linking it to our website, that’s from some time ago, during the original proposal, and that has now changed," Energy Ventures Analysis principal Thomas Hewson told PolitiFact Florida. Because of all the factors involved, predictions on how the plan would affect utility rates are in constant flux, he said. Hewson added that the company had since revisited the Clean Power Plan in a 2015 report for the National Mining Association. Energy Ventures Analysis hasn’t re-evaluated utility rates on a state-by-state basis, Hewson said. The National Mining Association study was about wholesale electricity prices, although it did say those would go up in Florida. Their estimates are on the high end of how much the Clean Power Plan would cost and have been attacked by groups that favor renewable energy. The Natural Resources Defense Council called Energy Ventures Analysis, which has some ties to the coal industry, a "fossil industry mouthpiece." Few other studies look at the specific impact on individual states, although most say the plan’s results largely depend on how utilities in individual states supply their power and charge their customers. Those decisions are usually made on a state level, and can drastically change how the Clean Power Plan’s standards come into play. Some of the rosier reports are the complete opposite of the Energy Venture Analysis study. The group Advanced Energy Economy predicted there will be no real change to energy prices at all in Florida. The EPA’s own analysis predicted that the plan will eventually result in electricity prices going down, although most groups predict a modest increase. "Our modeling shows average annual changes in Florida retail prices of less than 1 percent between the baseline and the policy," said Dallas Burtraw, senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a think tank that tracks energy policy. "Our results are consistent with those from the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Nicholas Institute (at Duke University)." Our ruling Americans For Prosperity Florida said, "Patrick Murphy’s ‘Pay More’ energy agenda means you could pay another $500 a year for your utility bills!" The group is attempting to link Murphy’s support for the Clean Power Plan to the possibility of higher gas and electric rates for consumers. But Murphy has no control over the rule, and the study AFP cited is disputed and outdated. Economic impacts of the Clean Power Plan, which is currently on hold by order of the U.S. Supreme Court, are a hotly debated subject with no clear result. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/430a8f6a-9aad-4a91-a282-c842cdaf1930	None	Americans for Prosperity: Florida	None	None	None	2016-09-20T10:00:00	2016-09-12	['None']
pomt-14300	"I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-claims-meet-press-wall-street-atta/	As challenger Bernie Sanders continues to hit Hillary Clinton over her Wall Street ties in Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton noted that she and the financial sector are more enemies than friends. On Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd played Clinton a clip of Sanders joking on the campaign trail that her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs must have been written in Shakespearean prose. "I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against," she responded. "So I find this, again, a kind of, you know, circuitous way to raise questions about my record." Is it true that Clinton is the sole target of Wall Street this cycle? The Clinton campaign referred us to our own fact-check of an attack ad sponsored by the hedge fund-backed conservative super PAC, Future45. While this supports Clinton’s point that the financial sector has spent money against her, it doesn’t back the notion that Wall Street has only attacked her. We consulted with Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics and Nancy Watzman of the Political TV Ad Archive. Their data shows that Clinton’s statement is inaccurate. The trouble with her claim is Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers aren’t a monolithic group. Some have even expressed their support for Clinton and Sanders, and their donations are dispersed among Republican and Democratic groups. While Clinton has been the target of more attack ads than Sanders, more money from the financial industry has been spent hitting each of the remaining Republicans. In fact, the candidate subject to the most Wall Street-funded hits is actually Donald Trump. Ad blitzes against Clinton primarily come from three conservative groups. In addition to the ad we fact-checked, Future45 has run six others against Clinton. Wall Street donations account for half of the group’s funding. American Crossroads, founded by Karl Rove, has sponsored eight anti-Clinton ads and the Mitt Romney-affiliated group America Rising has released 10 ads attacking her, two of which also target Sanders. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the financial industry is responsible for roughly half of the Rove’s group total donations and two-thirds of the Romney group’s. Future45 has also sponsored one ad against Sanders. ESA Fund, a conservative super PAC, is 56 percent funded by the financial sector and has aired one anti-Sanders ad in Iowa. And last summer, Generation Forward, a pro-Martin O’Malley super PAC, went after Sanders’ record on guns. A fifth of its donations come from Wall Street. Clinton’s own affiliated super PAC, Priorities USA Action, took a third of its donations from the financial sector. It has aired 11 ads against Trump and spent more than $61,000 targeting the Republican frontrunner. (Update: Priorities USA Action said that the 11 videos it produced only appeared on the Internet.) But that pales in comparison to the amount of money and airtime Trump’s fellow Republicans have devoted to slamming him. Conservative groups have spent more than $28 million opposing Trump. Our Principles PAC, launched by a former Romney aide, has spent more than $14 million against Trump and sponsored at least 27 ads attacking him. A third of the group’s funding comes from Wall Street. Marco Rubio’s affiliated super PAC, Conservative Solutions, aired seven anti-Trump ads and received about 40 percent of its funding from the financial sector. Rubio himself was the subject of 11 attack ads by Ted Cruz’s Keep the Promise I super PAC (hedge fund manager Robert Mercer was responsible for $11 million of its $11,036,250 total donations), and 12 by Jeb Bush’s Right to Rise, which is half funded by Wall Street. Here are the 10 groups with the largest share of Wall Street donations and their opposition opponents, compiled with help from Maguire and Watzman: Name Wall Street support* Opposition ads** Keep the Promise I 99.7 percent 11 against Rubio, 7 against Trump, 6 against Clinton America Rising 68.2 percent 10 against Clinton, 2 against Sanders Citizen Super PAC 61.0 percent 1 against Trump Future45 58.0 percent 7 against Clinton, 1 against Sanders America Leads 53.1 percent 2 against Clinton, 1 against John Kasich American Crossroads 53.1 percent 8 against Clinton, 1 against Trump Right to Rise 51.1 percent 12 against Rubio, 9 against Trump, 5 against Kasich, 4 against Clinton, 2 against Cruz, 2 against Chris Christie Patriot Voices PAC 47 percent 1 against Clinton New Day for America 46 percent 10 against Trump, 5 against Cruz, 4 against Clinton, 4 against Bush, 3 against Rubio, 2 against Christie Conservative Solutions PAC 39.8 percent 9 against Bush, 8 against Trump, 7 against Ted Cruz, 6 against Clinton, 2 against Christie, 1 against Kasich * Includes financial, insurance and real estate donations. ** Many of these ads target multiple candidates at once, so the counts overlap. Some of these ads are clearly ads attacking a candidate, while others compare one candidate favorably against others. As you’ll notice, Sanders — who rails against Wall Street daily — has been largely spared by the attack ads. That’s because the finance sector takes Clinton seriously and Sanders less so, according to John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University who wrote the book In Defense of Negativity: Attack Advertising in Presidential Campaigns. "Sanders has an important message that is resonating with many. But that is not enough to win the nomination," Geer said. "Why spend money that will have little return on the investment?" Our ruling Clinton said, "I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against." Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are running ads against Clinton. But to say she’s the only one being attacked by people associated with the financial sector is preposterous. The financial sector has contributed to both sides of the aisles, including to Clinton’s own campaign. Groups backed by Wall Street have run attack ads against virtually every candidate.

pomt-01349	Rick Scott says he supported in-state tuition for Dreamers while Charlie Crist was against it.	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-supported-state-tuition-dreamer/	Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist argued about immigration reform during their third and final debate. Scott defended his record in the debate, arguing that he had helped out a certain group of illegal immigrants afford college -- "dreamers." "Dreamers," named for the as-yet unpassed DREAM Act, are illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. After Congress failed to pass the bill, President Barack Obama in June 2012 announced a two-year moratorium on the deportation of some children who had been brought to United States illegally by their parents. "Let’s look at what I did do that Charlie said was the wrong thing to do," Scott said. "I said if you grow up in our state, you should get the same in-state tuition as your peers. Charlie said when the Legislature didn’t pass it before, that they did the right thing. So Charlie was against that, but we did the right thing, because whatever country you grew up in, if you live in Florida you ought to have the same right (to) in-state tuition as your peers." However, Scott is omitting part of his own record -- and part of Crist’s record -- about "dreamers" and in-state tuition. In-state tuition battles In April 2014 when it appeared that the Legislature under Gov. Scott would approve in-state tuition for certain illegal immigrants, the Republican Party of Florida said in an email that "In 2006, Charlie Crist opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants." (That was back when Crist was a Republican; he’s now running as a Democrat to win back his old office.) As support for its claim, the state party's email cited a 2006 Miami Herald article about Crist, who was then serving as state attorney general. The Herald article said that "Crist, like (his GOP rival for governor CFO Tom) Gallagher, said state lawmakers did the ‘right thing’ earlier this year when they rejected a bill allowing children of illegal immigrants to pay the same tuition rates as Florida residents. But Crist, also like Gallagher, said he supported a proposal to let illegal immigrants get drivers' licenses. It didn't pass two years ago, despite support from Gov. Jeb Bush." That year, a proposal to give certain Florida residents who were illegal immigrants in-state tuition divided Republican legislators and drew opposition from then-Senate President Tom Lee. Ultimately, the proposal failed. (Bush had said he supported giving in-state tuition to those children if they’d lived in Florida at least two years, but he added that he felt it wasn’t the year to deal with it, so the controversial provision was removed from an education bill.) When we looked at this question previously, a spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Florida didn’t point to any additional statements by Crist as support for the claim. So we searched for other statements by Crist about giving in-state tuition to children of illegal immigrants. We found little else prior to his current campaign as a Democrat. We did not locate any bills to grant in-state tuition to "dreamers" that reached Crist’s desk during his tenure as governor 2007 and 2011. We did find an August 2006 article in the Tampa Bay Times that included a one-word "yes" or "no" answer from gubernatorial candidates to several questions, including: "Should we allow the children of illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at our universities?" The answer for Crist? "No." That provides support for Scott’s claim. However, both candidates have had a zigzagging approach to the issue, which complicates the neat story line Scott tried to communicate in the CNN debate. Scott omitted that during the 2014 campaign, Crist has supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. "We must immediately pass legislation that allows the children of undocumented parents to attend Florida colleges and universities at in-state tuition levels," Crist wrote on the immigration page of his campaign website. "It simply isn’t fair to punish children of undocumented parents." At the same time, Scott omitted that he changed his opinion about the issue, earning him a Full Flop from PolitiFact Florida. In September 2011, Scott told the conservative website Newsmax that "with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, I completely oppose it." That changed by 2014 when, after a decade of failed attempts, it appeared that the Legislature might pass the bill. In mid-April, Scott made his support clear. In a joint statement with former Republican Govs. Jeb Bush and Bob Martinez, Scott said, "Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition rate at universities their peers and classmates do. We want our students to stay here in Florida when they go to college and when they choose a career, and that means we must make college more affordable for all those students who call Florida home. The Florida Senate should take immediate action to move S.B. 1400 forward." Our ruling Scott said he supported in-state tuition for "dreamers" while Crist was against it. There’s some truth to that claim, but the reality is that both candidates have flip-flopped on the issue, manking such a clear-cut comparison problematic. In reality, Scott was against in-state tuition for "dreamers" in 2011 but came for it in 2014. Crist opposed it in 2006 but voiced his support during this current campaign.

pomt-07224	Says "for the first time ever," Texas lawmakers are not funding student population growth.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/03/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-not-funding-enrollment-grow/	The Democratic state senator whose filibuster kept lawmakers from advancing a plan determining how much schools will get in state aid in 2012-13 told colleagues she was standing up for history. Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth said the House-approved plan "sets a new normal that says for the first time, we are not going to fund student population growth," according to a news article posted online May 30 by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Davis opened her filibuster by saying the plan "will mean the very first time ever in the history of funding public schools that we are not going to fund student population growth. Let me say that again. For the first time ever, we are not funding student population growth." Got it. But did she get the lack of precedent right? First, some background: The 2012-13 state budget already sent to Gov. Rick Perry allocates $4 billion less in state funds than districts would get under existing funding formulas to accommodate enrollment growth . According to a Legislative Budget Board summary, that reduced "funding level assumes passage of legislation that adjusts school district and charter school payments to the level of available appropriations." Put another way, the budget is premised on lawmakers divvying up per-student aid in amounts that overlook the state’s expectation that 170,000 additional students will be enrolled by the end of August 2013, according to a February background report on state budget issues by the House Research Organization. Davis talked the share-the-pain proposal to death May 29, the day before the regular legislative session ended. Perry immediately called a 30-day special session on topics including the school aid changes. And how did Davis conclude this is the first time enrollment increases aren’t covered? Earlier this year, the senator asked budget board staff to look into "whether or not the state has historically funded enrollment growth in the Foundation School Program," the state’s primary source for allocating money to Texas schools in an equitable manner. Since 1984-85, the April 29 memo from LBB analyst Jennifer Schiess to Davis says, "the state has appropriated sufficient funds to fully fund state obligations, including enrollment growth, under the school finance formulas in effect at the time of appropriation." Davis’s office publicized the memo on May 3. The memo also states: "This analysis should not be interpreted to imply that at any point prior to the 1984-85 biennium the state failed to meet this obligation. Data required for analysis going further back is simply not readily available for a timely response." Anthony Spangler, Davis’s spokesman, told us that the staff did not follow up with deeper historical analysis. Separately, experts say school funding has depended in part on student enrollment counts at least since passage of the landmark Gilmer-Aikin laws of 1949 modernizing the school system and creating the Foundation School Program. Even before then--and continuing in 2012-13--the state sent an allotment of money per student from income earned on the state’s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund. The 2010-11 Available School Fund allotment is $455 per student, according to the Texas Education Agency. Then again, a primer on Texas school finance revised by the Texas Association of School Boards in 1996 says that in earlier years--even back to 1854--state education aid was distributed on a "per-capita" basis. Meaning? Austin lobbyist Dan Casey, its author, told us in an interview that funding was connected to pupil counts. He pointed out that a 1925 book, "The Development of Education in Texas," states that until lawmakers in 1903 offered more money for "manual training" classes, "Texas had always adhered to the policy of distributing state educational funds on the per capita basis." Our sense? For the first time in more than 25 years, the budget approved by legislators does not fully account for enrollment increases. Prior to 1984, information to prove or disprove Davis' statement is more fuzzy, but it's clear that Texas has allocated education funding on a per-student basis since the 19th century. We rate Davis' statement Mostly True.	None	Wendy Davis	None	None	None	2011-06-03T06:00:00	2011-05-29	['Texas']
pomt-02221	"In the last couple of days, notices were sent (by officials in Ukraine) to Jews in one city indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/18/john-kerry/john-kerry-says-jews-eastern-ukraine-told-register/	Editor’s note: After receiving reader feedback on this rating, we expanded the "our ruling" section on April 21, 2014, to more fully explain our reasoning for the rating. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke from Geneva on Thursday with appalling news about religious intolerance in the Ukrainian-Russian crisis. "In the last couple of days, notices were sent to Jews in one city indicating that they had to identify themselves as Jews," Kerry said. "In the year 2014, after all of the miles traveled and all of the journey of history, this is not just intolerable; it's grotesque." On Facebook and Twitter, the public feared the history of the Holocaust was repeating itself. At PolitiFact, we’re used to finding inconsistencies in media coverage of Ukraine, so we wanted to take a closer look at the situation. We found that Ukrainian Jews are not being forced to register. The story seems to have originated in Donetsk, a region and a city in eastern Ukraine. On April 7, pro-Russian activists took control of Donetsk’s government building. Almost two weeks later, USA Today reported, "Leaflet tells Jews to register in East Ukraine." Citing an Israeli news article, USA Today reported that Jews emerging from a synagogue in Donetsk on April 14 were handed pamphlets asking them to "register" with pro-Russian militants. If Jewish adults refused to register and pay a $50 fee, they’d be forced out of the country. On the same day the story appeared, Kerry mentioned the notice in his speech. We reached out to Kerry's office for evidence, but they pointed us back to his remarks. Almost immediately, there were signs that the fliers weren’t really coming from any kind of authority. The separatist whose signature allegedly appears on the flier -- Donetsk People’s Republic Chairman Denis Pushilin, leader of the pro-Russian militants -- denied any connection to it. Reporters on the ground quickly found that no one was actually being registered. PolitiFact exchanged emails with Ari Shapiro, an NPR international correspondent reporting from Donetsk, who said there is a real flier, but it went ignored until the media caught on. Shapiro himself went after the story and shared his reporting with us. "You walk down the street with a beard and kippah," said Yaguda Kellerman, deputy chief of the Donetsk Jewish Community Center, to Shapiro. "And you never experience any problems here. I was born in Donetsk." Donetsk chief rabbi Pinchas Vishedski acknowledged the flier’s existence, but called it a provocation, Shapiro reported. U.S. media outlets like Vox and the New Republic have also questioned its validity. A New York Times report from Donetsk said that militants never intended to set up a registry, and the room designated for registering Jews sat empty Thursday. Both sides -- pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian -- have accused each other of anti-Semitism during this conflict. An April 15 United Nations report noted that the Association of Jewish Organisations and Communities of Ukraine has said incidents are isolated and that Jewish people, generally speaking, don’t feel threatened by Ukrainian leaders. The pro-Russia rebels have since put out their own flier attacking the original anti-Semitism accusations, Shapiro reported. Our ruling Kerry said Ukrainian Jews are being asked to register. There was a flier, but it doesn’t seem to have been issued by any authority. No one knows yet who distributed them, but the separatist movement denies issuing the fliers. Jewish community leaders in the area have denounced the pamphlets’ legitimacy. Reporters on the ground in Donetsk say that the fliers aren’t being taken seriously, and no Jews are registering. Kerry’s comments included none of that context. It’s possible Kerry’s comments were drawn from what he considered to be legitimate news reports, but those earlier reports didn’t include the full picture of what was going on. Anyone listening to Kerry’s remarks would think that the requests were coming from some sort of authority on the ground that had the means to enforce its request, and that’s not the case. Kerry’s remarks did not accurately convey the situation on the ground in Ukraine. For these reasons, we rate his statement False.

pomt-10868	"I'm the first person who really took up the issue of the war. Four years ago I said that there was no proof that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and, actually... did an analysis which disproved the cause for the war."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/28/dennis-kucinich/kucinich-opposed-the-war-early-but-first/	On the topic of the conflict in Iraq, Dennis Kucinich holds the high ground among his Democratic rivals who oppose the war with his 2002 vote against authorizing military action against Saddam Hussein. Of the Democrats running for president who were in Congress at the time, Kucinich is the only one who voted against the war resolution. But to earn the crown as the "first" -- whatever that means, and Kucinich's campaign wouldn't clarify -- is a more nuanced privilege. Was he the first person? No. Was he the first Congressman? No. Was he the first presidential candidate? No (Correct answer: Republican Ron Paul). Was he the first Democratic presidential candidate? Yes. According to the Congressional Record, the Cleveland Democrat first spoke against the war in the context of Iraq in remarks made March 20, 2002. Kucinich advocated peace and warned against the slippery slope of nuclear weapons. (Paul spoke out on Nov. 29, 2001 saying "the argument that (Saddam) Hussein is producing weapons of mass destruction is the reddest of all herrings," according to the Congressional Record.) But Kucinich earned the title as the leader of the anti-war movement in late August 2002 after holding a widely reported Capitol Hill briefing where he called for more "discussion about why we should not go to war," according to an article in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. He then began building a congressional coalition against the war. "Unilateral military action by the United States against Iraq is unjustified, unwarranted and illegal," said Kucinich, according to The Washington Times on Sept. 20, 2002. "The administration has failed to make the case that Iraq poses an imminent or immediate threat to the United States." Kucinich solidified his position as the opposition headmaster Oct. 3, 2002, when he took the floor of the House to present an eight-page, point-by-point analysis refuting the joint resolution on Iraq in the days before the vote.

pomt-09416	"As Florida's CFO, I shut down Krakow's scam and refunded more than $1.2 million to Josephine and other victims of this con man."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/18/alex-sink/sink-claims-she-refunded-12-million-insurance-frau/	CFO Alex Sink, a Democrat running for governor, is appealing to Florida’s elderly by putting the spotlight on a two-year crackdown on an investment scam and refund to a Delray Beach woman. Sink wrote about the episode in a fundraising e-mail to supporters. "As Florida’s CFO, I shut down [Larry] Krakow's scam and refunded more than $1.2 million to Josephine [Passinissi] and other victims of this con man,'' she said in an e-mail addressed to "Dear Friend." It said: "Please contribute $25, or whatever you can, right now to help me keep fighting for Floridians like Josephine." Sink’s e-mail contains several claims, but we're focusing on two: Whether the CFO's office shut down the investment "scam" and whether it returned $1.2 million to Passinissi and the others. Sink has been claiming credit for the crackdown and using it to promote her Safeguard Our Seniors Task Force since her office put out a release on Sept. 28, 2009, under the headline "CFO Sink Returns $1.2 Million to Delray Beach Seniors Scammed out of Life Savings." The Miami Herald wrote a brief item about the episode at the time that called it insurance fraud and likewise characterized it as Sink returning $1.2 million to four Delray Beach seniors "after they were allegedly misled into buying equity indexed deferred annuities." It said Larry Yale Krakow, who sold the investment products to them, was suspended from selling insurance and was ordered to pay a $25,000 fine. A deferred annuity is an investment product packaged with an insurance policy, in which an insurance company guarantees an income stream to the investor starting at a specified future date in return for a lump sum or series of payments. But the products are usually considered inappropriate for seniors because they tie up needed income. The Herald noted that annuities scams involving seniors have been a growing problem in Florida. And that the Department of Financial Services launched 267 senior annuity investigations in the fiscal year ending June 30. Kevin Cate, Sink's press secretary at the Florida Department of Financial Services, provided us with links to the Florida statutes that illustrate the CFO's authority on the topic. The law also notes the rights of victims not to be identified. He faxed us the 2008 and 2009 settlement agreements that resolved four citizens' complaints against the Allianz insurance company, which Krakow purportedly represented, brought by the Florida Department of Insurance Division of Legal Services. Each had the seniors' identities redacted, but a summary page showed the range in reimbursements. The smallest was $19,319.27, while the largest was for one investor with nine annuities valued at $932,837.09. His summary page also noted that, with subsequent settlements, the figure was more than $1.5 million, which was slightly higher than Sink had said. Sink’s office handled the case through its Division of Insurance Fraud, which is part of the Department of Financial Services. Reached by telephone, Passinissi confirmed the refund. She said her share of it was $270,000. A former owner of a private employment agency, Passinissi, 74, said she tried to get her money out of the annuity in 2008 by contacting the insurance firm itself -- to no avail. She mentioned her plight to a banker she knew, who sent her to Sink. Passinissi said she called and then wrote Sink directly -- and enclosed documents to illustrate the problem. Passinissi is happy to see Sink take credit. "She wrote to me way, way back and I remember I was very impressed. She said, 'Don’t worry we’ll get to the bottom of it.' After that she sent a person to get a deposition from me, to get the facts," Passinissi said. As CFO, Sink oversees the Department of Financial Services, which investigated the complaints and arranged for people such as Passinissi to recoup their money. Sink's claim actually understates the amount that was recouped (she said $1.2 million when it ultimately totaled $1.5 million), but we find she can rightly claim credit for the department's work. So we rate Sink’s claim to be True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-03-18T14:11:29	2010-03-13	['Kraków']
pomt-08368	Says Peter DeFazio votes with Nancy Pelosi 86 percent of the time.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/26/concerned-taxpayers-america/concerned-taxpayers-claim-peter-defazio-votes-nanc/	Concerned Taxpayers of America is the lofty and nicely generic name of an independent expenditure group funded by two very rich people on the East Coast. The group has spent at least $300,000 for several TV ads attacking U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio and backing Republican challenger Art Robinson. The latest commercial is as cute as the cartoon kids on South Park. There’s DeFazio behind the wheel of his 1963 Dodge Dart as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in the passenger seat, exhorts him, "Turn left! Turn left!" and "Spend more! Tax more! Faster!" Again, very catchy -- and geared to generate maximum outrage in a congressional district that disdains Washington, D.C. But we were curious about the ad’s claims. Has DeFazio voted with Pelosi 86 percent of the time? Does he take directions, besides driving, from the speaker from San Francisco? PolitiFact Oregon always thought DeFazio, the state’s longest serving sitting congressman, really wasn’t big on party politics or groupthink. Democrats in other states have been hit with the same attack as Republicans try to capitalize on Pelosi’s unpopularity in swing districts. The attacks usually cite as evidence The Washington Post votes database or, as in this case, something called the National Republican Trust PAC. Go there and you’ll find "The Pelosi Index," which rates House members on how closely they hew to the speaker. There’s the Statue of Liberty at one end and Pelosi on the other, and anything above 75 percent is "tyranny." DeFazio’s counsel asked KEZI-TV, the ABC affiliate in Eugene, to stop airing the ads, arguing that the website doesn’t compare all votes between DeFazio and Pelosi. The letter read, in part: "Instead, it fabricates a percentage based on only 14 votes that it cherry-picked, out of hundreds cast by Rep. DeFazio. And it ignores the fact that, of those 14 selectively chosen votes, Speaker Pelosi did not even cast a vote on 3 of them." (The station briefly stopped airing the ad to conduct a review, but has since resumed.) Pelosi, as speaker, doesn’t vote much. She’s cast 94 votes in the 111th Congress, which opened January 2009. But regular member DeFazio does, and we thought it useful to check how he’s rated by the The Washington Post database. Here’s what we found: DeFazio has cast 1,508 votes this session, voting with the majority of his party 96.6 percent of the time. The average for Democrats is 92.2 percent, so DeFazio is higher than the average, although lower than the other Oregon House Democrats. Earl Blumenauer and David Wu are at 97 percent, and Kurt Schrader is at 97.1 percent. So the number is high, but remember, these tally all votes cast, even the mundane ones. And The Post database shows the percentage a lawmaker "agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members," not just Pelosi. Since PolitiFact Oregon has nothing but time, we ran our own comparison between DeFazio and Pelosi. We eliminated 24 of Pelosi’s 94 votes because they were roll calls or resolutions that both parties agreed on. That left 70 substantive votes, of which DeFazio disagreed on six. Percentage-wise, that’s 91 percent. So on both counts, DeFazio rates higher than the 86 percent figure cited in the commercial. But we needed to flesh out the disagreements -- because they are blowout disagreements -- and this gets to the larger question of whether DeFazio is indeed someone who’s just following Pelosi’s lead. DeFazio voted against a signature cap and trade climate bill pushed by Pelosi last year, saying it had too much carrot and not enough stick. And he was one of only seven House Democrats to vote against President Barack Obama’s $787 billion economic stimulus package in February 2009. Passage of the stimulus was one of the Democrats’ signature initiatives. DeFazio did vote for Obama’s health care plan, but only after finagling better Medicare reimbursement rates for Oregon. Defying party leadership, he opposed the $700 billion bailout of Wall Street in 2008 and voted against it in a follow-up bill in 2009. Most recently, he and a dozen House Democrats joined Republicans in voting against a business-lending act that he deemed too expensive for taxpayers without lending enough help to small businesses. In short, not a very good Pelosi lapdog. Finally, we checked National Journal’s annual rankings from 2009, just for fun. DeFazio had a 61.5 percent liberal voting record and a 38.5 percent conservative voting record. Again, he was the least liberal of Oregon’s four House Democrats. To summarize, DeFazio has diverged sharply from Democratic leadership on key issues, especially economic ones. To imply that Pelosi is really in the driver’s seat when it comes to DeFazio’s votes is false. But it’s true that agrees with his party most of the time. We rate this Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-11494	"Seventy to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/feb/27/tim-ryan/after-parkland-shooting-ohio-congressman-said-70-8/	Some lawmakers are pushing for changes to gun laws including universal background checks following the fatal mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. That includes U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who drew attention after the Las Vegas massacre in October when he announced he would donate to gun control groups roughly $20,000 that the NRA’s political action committee gave him over the years. Ryan received an A grade from the NRA earlier in his career but later broke from the group. "Seventy to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check," Ryan said on CNN’s New Day Feb. 20, days after the shooting in South Florida that left 17 people dead. Polls have consistently showed broad support for a universal background check. National polls in 2016 and 2017 found between 84 and 94 percent of respondents supported background checks. But what about NRA members? What NRA members say about a universal background check While federal law requires background checks for sales from federally licensed dealers, unlicensed, private sellers are not required to conduct background checks — although states can create their own laws. Some gun control advocates want a nationwide standard to close loopholes. Ryan’s spokesman cited a 2015 poll of gun owners by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm, conducted on behalf of two liberal groups: MoveOn.org Civic Action and the Center for American Progress. The poll surveyed 816 gun owners. According to the poll, 24 percent of the respondents identified themselves as NRA members. That means of the total of 816 gun owners, 196 self-identified as NRA members. Of all 816 gun owners, 83 percent responded that they supported a criminal background check for everyone who wants to buy a firearm. For the 196 who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks. The margin of error for the NRA sample is 7 percentage points, said Jim Williams, an analyst for Public Policy Polling. "Given that the support for background checks among the NRA subsample is so overwhelming, it’s still far outside the margin of error for that subset," he said. We also found an additional poll that included NRA members taking a position on background checks. Pew Research Center conducted a poll of 3,930 U.S. adults, including 1,269 gun owners, in March and April 2017. The unweighted sample size in the survey included 262 respondents who identified as NRA members. The poll included a breakdown of replies from Republican gun owners who were and were not members of the NRA. The poll showed based on weighted data that 52 percent of NRA members favored background checks for private gun sales compared with 75 percent of nonmembers. PolitiFact has previously looked at polls as far back as 2013 that found majority support among NRA members or households where someone was a member of the NRA. For example, a poll done by Johns Hopkins University and conducted online among 2,703 adults — including 169 respondents who identified as a member of the NRA — through GfK Knowledge Networks. The poll found that 74 percent of NRA members supported requiring background checks for all gun sales. (The margin of error was 7 percentage points.) After our 2015 fact-check of a claim related to that poll, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker contacted PolitiFact contending that the poll could not accurately survey NRA members because only the NRA has access to the list of current, dues-paying members. It is common practice in polling to ask respondents to identify whether they are members of, for example, a political party or other group. The NRA didn’t respond for this fact-check. We also previously looked at a poll by Republican pollster Frank Luntz in 2012 commissioned by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s group. That poll showed 74 percent of respondents who identified as NRA members favored background checks. The poll included 945 gun owners, half of whom said they were current or lapsed members of the NRA and the others non-NRA members. What polling experts said about the polls Janine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll and a professor at the University of Arkansas, said that the polls do not reflect a large enough sample of NRA members to reach the conclusion that 70 to 80 percent of NRA members support background checks. While it’s tempting to take a national sample and try to drill down, when looking at a smaller subset such as NRA members "you end up generalizing and that can be dangerous," she said. Ideally, a poll would include somewhere between 750 and 1,000 NRA members, she said. "You would need an independent polling organization to either oversample NRA members or have a big enough national sample to get you to at least 500, but preferably closer to 750 NRA members who can stand as a sample on their own," she said. We interviewed some polling experts who said that additional polls would help shed more light on the views of NRA members and that there are caveats about these polls’ methodologies. Polling expert Steven Smith, a professor of social sciences and political science at Washington University in St. Louis, told PolitiFact that the smaller the actual subgroup in the national population, the lower the precision and the larger the margin of error. However, if several polls show a majority of NRA members favor background checks, that increases the confidence in the findings. Some of our polling experts raised some criticisms about methodology. Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Polling Center, said he is dubious of any Interactive Voice Response (IVR) polling as the one done by Public Policy Polling. "They have incredibly low response rates and there is evidence that only the most politically motivated people really want to talk to a computer about their opinions," he said. Williams, of Public Policy Polling, defended the methodology and said IVR polling can cut down on social desirability bias — people telling a human questioner the answer they think they are "supposed" to say. Our ruling Ryan said that "70 to 80 percent of NRA members support a universal background check." Ryan is citing a poll from Public Policy Polling, conducted in 2015 for liberal groups. That poll found that among the respondents who said they were NRA members, the poll showed that 72 percent supported background checks. Other polls we looked at showed that between 52 and 74 percent of NRA members supported background checks. These polls are imperfect because they include small samples of NRA members, but they all suggest a majority of NRA members support background checks. New polling of larger numbers of NRA members would shed more light on the views of NRA members on background checks. With all that in mind, we rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-00295	Most of Kathy Manning’s donors are from out-of-state.	true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/26/ted-budd/budd-claims-most-mannings-donors-arent-north-carol/	U.S. Rep. Ted Budd and his Democratic challenger, Kathy Manning, had raised almost $3.1 million combined in their congressional race in North Carolina’s 13th district as of June. Manning has outraised Budd by almost $800,000 according to the Federal Election Commission. Budd has said on social media that most of Manning’s donors live outside of North Carolina. "Most of Kathy Manning’s support is coming from out-of-state liberal donors," Budd tweeted on Aug. 30. He posted a similar claim on Facebook as well. In both posts, Budd cites an Axios article. The article says 55.5 percent of Manning’s campaign donors are from outside of North Carolina. The article also notes 28 percent of Budd’s donors live outside of the state. Harry Stevens, a visual journalist at Axios, confirmed the data used for the article includes all the individual contributions listed on the FEC’s site. Their analysis does not include any donations made by political action committees. PolitiFact reached out to Budd’s office to see if he has any other evidence to back his claim, but has not heard back. This isn’t the first time a politician has made this kind of claim about their opponent’s donors. PolitiFact also reported on U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson from Ohio saying most of his opponent’s donors were out-of-state liberals. What PolitiFact is checking This fact check will be looking at the share of Manning’s donors who are from out-of-state. Budd’s statement specifically says Manning’s donors are "out-of-state liberals," but PolitiFact isn’t checking how many of the donors are liberal. That’s subjective, and the FEC does not keep track of how donors self-identify politically when recording donations. The Axios article Budd cites only analyzes individual contributions, and does not take PAC donations into consideration. PolitiFact will only look at individual contributions, as well. We are not analyzing any donations made by PACs. Who are Manning’s donors? Over 1,700 individuals have donated to Manning’s campaign. Many of them are doctors, lawyers and retirees. Based on information from the FEC and Open Secrets, run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, it does in fact appear that most of Manning’s donors are not from North Carolina. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Just 45 percent of Manning’s donors are in North Carolina, based on the dataset from the FEC. There are donors who gave money to Manning’s campaign more than once. We took that into consideration in analyzing the information by not including any repeat donors. What about ActBlue donors? On the FEC’s site, it appears at first glance that only a quarter of Manning’s donors are from North Carolina. There’s an explanation for that, and it’s called ActBlue. That’s a Massachusetts company which developed a fundraising software tool for Democratic candidates to use. Manning’s contribution page says it is powered by ActBlue. When the FEC makes note of campaign donations, it also lists every individual donation made through ActBlue. But not all of those donors are actually from West Somerville, Mass. It doesn’t stop there. The FEC essentially lists these donors as having made another donation outside of ActBlue. In reality, it is the same donation, and it can be confusing. Imagine having a monthly subscription to your local newspaper. You look at your bank account, and it says you’ve been charged for the month. You go about the rest of your week all jolly because you have unlimited access to local news. Until you look at your bank account the following week, and you think you got charged again for your newspaper subscription. You call your bank to try to make sense of what has happened. Turns out the newspaper company was giving you a heads up about the upcoming subscription charge the previous week, and you were actually charged just once. That’s how the FEC’s reports on ActBlue basically work. The donation was made once, but it’s listed twice under two different names. A Texas Republican congressman accused his opponent of getting more donations from Massachusetts than Texas by counting these as separate donations, but PolitiFact rated that claim Pants on Fire. The ActBlue donations do not change the fact that 55 percent of Manning’s donors live outside of North Carolina. Our ruling After combing through all of the publicly listed donations on the FEC’s site, it is true that most of Manning’s donors are from outside of North Carolina. We took the ActBlue donations into consideration, and they do not change the outcome. We rate this claim True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

pomt-14429	"Trump refuses to denounce the KKK."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/mar/09/conservative-solutions-pac/super-pac-ad-tying-trump-kkk-misses-mark/	Florida’s upcoming winner-take-all Republican primary is increasingly seen as the anti-Donald Trump faction’s last hope to stop the New York billionaire's march to the nomination. Numerous outside groups and super PACs are flooding the state’s airwaves with anti-Trump ads, including one tying him to the Ku Klux Klan. An ad from Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, includes clips of CNN’s Jake Tapper and Trump. Tapper: "I asked Donald Trump three times if he would disavow the support of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan." Trump: "Well, I have to look at the group." Narrator: "Trump refuses to denounce the KKK. Think about that — for president?" Because the ad has aired more than 430 times in Florida, according to Political TV Ad Archive, we thought it was worth taking a closer look. We gave the billionaire businessman a Pants on Fire rating for claiming to not to know anything about Duke. But it’s a stretch to say Trump "refuses to denounce the KKK" given his record of denouncements before and after the Tapper interview. The ad cites a Time article recapping Trump’s Feb. 28 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, where Trump dodged multiple questions from Tapper asking if he’d disavow the support of white supremacist and former KKK leader David Duke (he would later blame a "bad earpiece" for his noncommittal answers). Trump’s history with Duke has been pretty well documented by PolitiFact and fellow fact-checkers at the Washington Post and Factcheck.org. In a 1991 interview with CNN’s Larry King, Trump said he "hated" what Duke’s success with white voters in a failed bid for the Louisiana governorship represented. King: "Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him." Trump: "I hate —" King: "Four hundred New Yorkers contributed." Trump: "I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States." King: "Anger?" Trump: "It's anger. I mean, that's an anger vote. People are angry about what's happened. People are angry about the jobs. If you look at Louisiana, they're really in deep trouble." In 2000, Trump declined to run a Reform Party presidential bid in part because the party attracted the support of Duke, a "Klansman." "This is not company I wish to keep," he said at the time. Trump also called Duke "a bigot, a racist, a problem," in a 2000 interview with NBC’s Matt Lauer. Although Trump disavowed Duke and the KKK in the past, his criticism has been less pointed in 2016. In August 2015, Trump answered a question by Bloomberg’s John Heilemann asking if he would repudiate David Duke’s supportive comments of Trump’s campaign by saying, "I would do that if it made you feel better. I would certainly repudiate." The story popped up again after Buzzfeed reported on Feb. 25 that Duke was urging his supporters to vote for Trump, saying on his radio show that failure to do so would be "treason to your heritage." Asked about the endorsement the next day at a press conference, Trump said he wasn’t aware of it. "I didn’t even know he endorsed me," he said. "David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right. I disavow, okay?" After the interview with Tapper, Trump rejected Duke’s support in interviews on Good Morning America and Morning Joe, calling him a "bad person who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years." It’s worth noting that Duke, despite his support for white nationalism and former membership in neo-Nazi and openly racist groups, hasn’t been associated with the Klan for more than 40 years. Duke founded a Louisiana chapter of the racist group in 1974, but left the organization in 1980 because of its tendency towards violence and his inability to stop members of other chapters from doing "stupid or violent things." The modern-day Klan is a hodgepodge of dozens of independent chapters spread throughout the country with a total membership around 5,000, according to the Anti-Defamation League. There’s no central Klan organization that represents every chapter, but Arkansas-based Knights Party spokeswoman Rachel Pendergraft told Politico in December that Trump was a major talking point in the group’s recruitment efforts. Our ruling A pro-Rubio super PAC said, "Trump refuses to denounce the KKK." Trump hasn’t gone after the KKK and white nationalists like Duke with the same fervor as his opponents, but it’s inaccurate to make a blanket statement based on a single interview given his history of rejecting white supremacists.

"FOX Network Picks Up ‘Roseanne,’ Saying It Has No Problem With Occasional Racism," said a headline on potus-press.com. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. The site claimed that "just hours" after ABC canceled the show due to a racist tweet from Barr, "the Fox Network said it would be picking up the show." But there have been no legitimate reports about Fox Networks Group taking the show after its ABC cancellation. Fox Networks Group is an operating unit of 21st Century Fox, home to cable and broadcasting networks, including Fox News Channel, Fox Sports and FX. The post also attributes a made-up quote to Brian Sullivan, president and chief operating officer of Fox Networks Group. Sullivan is falsely quoted welcoming Barr to Fox. The story also falsely claimed President Donald Trump tweeted congratulations to Fox for picking up the show. Newsweek reported that some Roseanne fans tweeted expressing hope that Fox picks up the show. But that still hasn’t happened. Potus Press’ story has its origin in satire, but there’s nothing obvious on the post to clue readers into the fact that the post is meant as a joke. The story concluded with an H/T or "hat tip" and link to Extra News Feed, which posted the same story on May 30, filed under "Truth in Satire." Extra News Feed’s Twitter biography said it’s a "newsfeed w/ the same political rants you see on Facebook but they’re well written. we publish half satire & half essays. you decide which is which."

pomt-01181	"There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/dec/07/diego-arene-morley/brown-u-student-leader-more-african-american-men-p/	A Brown University student leader offered a provocative historical comparison at the beginning of a Nov. 18, 2014, forum on the efficacy of taxing and regulating marijuana in Rhode Island. "There are more African-American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850," said Diego Arene-Morley, president of Brown University Students for Sensible Drug Policy. Arene-Morley made the statement to highlight that African-American and Hispanic men are arrested at disproportionate rates under the current drug laws. We wondered whether Arene-Morley got his numbers right, so we asked him what he based his statement on. We also reached out to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics and the national nonprofit advocacy group, The Sentencing Project, for current figures. And we contacted the U.S. Census Bureau and the Rhode Island Historical Society for data about slavery in 1850. The Census of 1850 showed that 872,924 male African-American slaves over age 15 lived in the United States at that time. (The same Census found that there were a total of 3.2 million African-American slaves of all ages, at a time when the total U.S. population, including slaves and "free coloreds," was 23.2 million.) How does that compare with the number of African-American men now under some sort of judicial system supervision? According to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were 526,000 African-American men serving time in state or federal correctional facilities in 2013. (That’s 37 percent of the overall 1.5 million imprisoned men.) That represented almost 3 percent of the overall black male population in the United States, compared with .5 percent of white males, according to the bureau. There were 877,000 African-American men on probation in 2013, according to the bureau. And there were 280,000 African-American male parolees. (Probation is part of a criminal sentence that allows an offender to remain under supervision in the community instead of jail. Parole is the supervised release of an inmate from jail before his or her official release date.) In total, there were about 1.68 million African-American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013, 807,076 more than the number of African-American men who were enslaved in 1850. Marc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, provided a somewhat higher estimate for the number of African-American men now imprisoned or on probation and parole. His number, which includes those serving time in local jails, was about 1.88 million, more than 1 million above the 1850 figure. For the Rhode Island perspective, we asked the state Department of Corrections for its numbers. As of Oct. 10, there were 932 African-American men sentenced or awaiting trial in Rhode Island out of 3,108 male inmates overall. In addition, 4,285 African-American men were on probation; 87 on parole; and 4 are on lifetime supervision, according to spokeswoman Susan Lamkins. That totals 5,308, or 11 percent of the 48,542 black or African-American men in Rhode Island 18 years or older, according to the Census estimates as of July 1, 2013. When Arene-Morley got back to us, he referred us to the book "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness" by Michelle Alexander and to an interview with Alexander featured on the Huffington Post website. The Huffington Post piece attributes to Alexander a statement the more black men are behind bars or under the watch of the criminal justice system than there were enslaved in 1850. Our ruling Arene-Morley said that "There are more African American men in prison, jail, on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850." Our research found that U.S. Bureau of Criminal Statistics put the number of African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013 at about 1.68 million -- 807,076 above the number of African American men enslaved in 1850. The Sentencing Project, too, puts that number at 1.88 million with local jails factored in. Given that evidence, we rate Arene-Morley’s claim True.

pomt-07455	"In this bill that I’ve just signed, we don’t cut anybody’s salary. We don’t take away their pension. And we don’t destroy their health care."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/19/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-new-state-labor-law-doesnt-cu/	Opponents and supporters of Ohio’s new collective bargaining law are preparing for a possible referendum in November that would decide whether the controversial measure stays on the books. So it’s no surprise Republican Gov. John Kasich, a proponent of Senate Bill 5, immediately began defending the law after he signed it on the last day of March. The law will sharply reduce public workers’ collective bargaining rights. Unions have declared the law an attack on Ohio’s middle class. Kasich rejects the argument that it will damage public workers’ livelihoods. "In this bill that I’ve just signed, we don’t cut anybody’s salary. We don’t take away their pension. And we don’t destroy their health care," Kasich said March 31 in a interview with Sean Hannity on the Fox News Network. Campaigns for and against SB 5 are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars to sway voters should opponents of the new law collect enough signatures to put the referendum on the ballot. Kasich himself sent an e-mail to supporters promoting passage of SB 5 and seeking campaign donations. With such a passionate debate on the horizon, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Kasich’s characterization of SB 5. Before we get into the specifics of Kasich’s claim, it is important to remember a few things: SB 5 does not alter any existing contracts. The law will not take effect until after the fall election if enough signatures are gathered by a June 30 deadline to put the referendum on the ballot. If that deadline passes and signatures are short of the required 231,147, the law takes effect in July. Now let’s begin. We’ll break this down into thirds, examining how SB 5 affects pensions, health care and worker salaries. We relied on interviews and an analysis of the 444-page bill by the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission to reach our conclusions. Impact on pensions Kasich was correct when he said the bill does not take away worker pensions. The new law could affect amount employees contribute toward their pension plans. It does not change pension benefits in any way, nor does it grant management new authority to do so. Many public workers contribute 10 percent of their salary toward their pension while the employer contributes 14 percent of the a worker’s salary. Some unions, however, have negotiated deals where the employer pays a portion of the employee contribution. If an employer agreed to pay 2 percent of the worker share, for example, it would pay 16 percent of the worker’s salary and the worker would pay 8 percent. Senate Bill 5 prohibits the practice, known as a "pension pick-up." So Kasich is correct to say the bill does not "take away" any worker’s pension. Some workers who benefited from pension pick-ups, however, would have to pay more of their pension contributions under SB 5. Impact on health care Kasich says the bill does not "destroy" workers’ health care. The governor is correct here too because the bill does not change health care benefits. It limits the share of the premiums that the public employer can pay toward those benefits. The new law bars public employers from paying more than 85 percent of health care coverage costs. That leaves at least 15 percent to employees. State workers currently pay 15 percent of their health care costs, but many other public workers pay less. While SB 5 will shift health care costs onto some workers, it does not "destroy" benefits. Impact on wages The shifts in pension and health care contributions could have a direct effect on wages. If the new law shifts a bigger share of retirement and health care costs onto workers, they’ll want higher wages to make up the difference so their take home pay remains intact. Kasich said "we don’t cut anybody’s salary." In a literal sense, he is correct. SB 5 does not set new salaries for public workers. But the new law effectively wipes out salary schedules in past labor contracts and directs cities and unions to agree to new salary structures that assign pay raises based on job performance. Kasich other supporters often tout the leverage the new law provides local governments to control labor costs. Management gains a new edge under SB 5 through the reduction of public workers’ collective bargaining rights, a ban on striking and a new system to resolve labor disputes that favors employers. So while Kasich has said the bill does not cut workers’ pay, he also has promoted SB 5 as a tool to control labor costs. Which is it? Critics say the answer is obvious. "Something has to give somewhere," said Dennis Willard, a spokesman for We Are Ohio, an anti-SB 5 group collecting signatures to put the bill on the fall ballot. "The only possible way for these local governments to save money is to eliminate jobs or reduce wages. There’s no other way." Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols insisted the bill "doesn’t prescribe wages," so it is inaccurate to conclude SB 5 cuts workers pay. But reduced pay is a near certainty in some communities. Kasich says the bill "didn’t cut anybody’s wages," but some key points are missing from that statement: Workers who have to pick up an increased portion of their health care and pension premiums will see less take-home pay in their checks unless their public employer raises wages to cover the heightened premiums -- a doubtful proposition if the new law is truely a tool to control labor costs. Cities across the state are looking to cut costs – and SB 5 gives mayors and school boards the leverage to cut pay as they negotiate with their workers in the future. Those are important pieces of information needed to put Kasich’s statement in proper context. On the Truth-O-Meter, that rates as Half True.

pomt-06318	"We cut a record $15 billion from our state budget."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/nov/14/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-leaders-cut-15-billion-state/	Proclaiming himself a "doer, not a talker," Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry makes two claims about his accomplishments as the Texas governor in a television ad that has been broadcast in Iowa and New Hampshire. "In Texas, we created 40 percent of the new jobs in the entire country since June of 2009," Perry says. "And we cut a record $15 billion from our state budget." We’ve checked numerous claims about Texas job growth, including one by Perry in June 2011 that 48 percent of all jobs created in the United States since June 2009 were in the Lone Star State. Half True, we said, pointing out that there are many ways to slice and dice employment statistics. Also, experts have advised us that a state’s job performance — be they gains or losses — shouldn’t be pinned on the top officeholder. Too many factors are in play for a single state official to merit credit or blame. For this article, we wondered whether a record $15 billion was cut from the state budget, as Perry says. As backup for that claim, Perry’s campaign pointed to a May 2011 report on the two-year state budget that the Texas Legislature approved and Perry signed into law this year. The budget covers fiscal 2012, which began Sept. 1, 2011, and fiscal 2013. The report by the Legislative Budget Board — whose staff members analyze state appropriations — compares spending in the 2012-13 budget ($172.3 billion), including state and federal money, with that in the previous budget cycle ($187.5 billion). The difference is $15.2 billion. (Since Perry’s ad began airing, the board has released updated budget figures that are slightly different from those in the May 2011 report. That information was not available to the Perry campaign, however, so our research focuses on the earlier report.) The $15 billion reduction amount stands alone for the past half-century, according to John Barton, a spokesman for the budget board’s staff. From 1951 through 2009, Barton said, no Legislature budgeted less spending from all sources than what had been spent in the previous budget. Before then, he said, Texas lawmakers did not write a single budget covering all state agencies. So, there’s a basis for Perry’s "record" $15 billion boast. Next, we looked at the figures behind it and found three factors that seem to diminish Perry’s claim. Let’s take them one by one. First, Perry’s cited spending reductions were primarily federal funds, most of them being one-time stimulus dollars that lawmakers knew wouldn’t be available for the 2012-13 budget cycle. According to the LBB report, federal funding dropped 25 percent, compared with a 2 percent cut in state general revenue spending — the expenditures over which the governor and lawmakers have the most sway. In raw figures, federal funding fell by $18.2 billion while state general revenue spending dropped $1.6 billion. (Increases in other spending categories offset some of those losses, bringing the net reduction to $15.2 billion.) More than half the drop in federal money, $11.8 billion of it, traces to the absence of one-time federal economic stimulus aid that Congress approved in 2009, Barton told us. Texas lawmakers used that money primarily for education and health care costs in the 2010-11 budget. Second, the 2012-13 budget is expected to grow, which will drive down Perry’s $15 billion reduction figure. It was much-reported during this year’s legislative session that lawmakers failed to appropriate enough state money to cover all of the projected Medicaid costs for 2012-13. That means that absent major changes in demand for services or program costs, the Legislature will have to pony up more money for Medicaid — a state-federal partnership providing health insurance to low-income Americans — before the end of the 2013 fiscal year. In its May 2011 report, the budget board staff estimated that lawmakers would need to infuse the program with an additional $4.4 billion in state dollars. If the $4.4 billion in state aid is added on, the federal government will send the state an estimated $5.3 billion in federal Medicaid "matching" funds, according to Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. So, total spending in the 2012-13 Texas budget could increase by nearly $10 billion, although Goodman cautioned that actual Medicaid spending will probably vary from the projections reached this year based on factors such as the size of the state’s caseload and medical costs. An extra $10 billion in spending for 2012-13 would bring the total budget to about $182 billion and reduce Perry’s budget cut to about $5.5 billion. Third, it was also well-reported that lawmakers reduced spending on public education in the 2012-13 budget by delaying a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts a few days, pushing it from the end of the 2013 fiscal year into the next budget cycle. Considering these factors, the cuts in the 2012-13 budget don’t look as large as Perry touts in his campaign ad. Counting the effects of postponing Medicaid and public school expenditures and including additional federal aid that would roll in if the state commits more to Medicaid, the 2012-13 budget may actually be closer to $184.3 billion. Compare that total to the $187.5 billion spending figure for 2010-11 in the LBB report, and the budget cut shrinks to about $3.2 billion. There is another perspective on the question of how much the Legislature cut the budget this year. Eva DeLuna Castro, an analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Austin think tank, told us that any analysis by her organization would also consider as cuts the difference between 2012-13 appropriations and the amount of money the state would have had to spent to maintain current service levels in its programs, including the cost of school-age population growth. DeLuna Castro said that in this vein, the budget cuts for 2012-13 were "closer to $22 billion." We also looked into what experts at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative Austin think tank, have said about the 2012-13 budget. In a May 26, 2011, statement, Talmadge Heflin, director of the foundation’s Center for Fiscal Policy, praised Texas as "leading the way in showing that government can be made smaller." He also noted, however, that $12 billion of the $15 billion reduction "comes from the expiration of the federal stimulus package." Heflin continued: "Just as those one-time stimulus funds artificially inflated the current budget, the end of those funds makes it look like the Texas Legislature cut deeper than it really did." Our ruling Nobody disputes that the latest Texas budget spends considerably less than the previous one — and Perry’s $15 billion figure has a basis. However, much of the ballyhooed reduction reflects the loss of one-time federal stimulus aid — a "cut" originating in Congress and one that was not in Perry’s control. Put another way, the budget he signed into law trimmed state spending (which the governor can directly influence) by $1.6 billion. Also, Perry’s calculation doesn’t acknowledge the state’s underfunding of Medicaid and a delayed education payment — which, if counted, would knock the budget cut down to about $3 billion in total, $12 billion less than what Perry celebrates.

pomt-03537	Fewer Democrats were on the Georgia general election ballot in 2012 than in more than 100 years.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/29/bryan-long/ballot-claim-hard-prove-over-100-years/	You can’t win if you don’t play. That mantra holds true for the lottery and for politics, or so says one Georgia politico. Bryan Long, executive director of the group Better Georgia, expressed this sentiment to the head of Georgia’s Democratic Party, Mike Berlon, last month during an Atlanta Press Club event. With retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ seat up for grabs, Berlon would rather the party support a single candidate for an uncontested primary. That doesn’t sit too well with some of the party’s leaders, who chided Berlon for not putting up Democratic candidates to run in some key 2012 state races. "When we ran the numbers, we saw fewer Democrats on the ballot in this last election than in more than 100 years," Long said. "If your goal was to increase the turnout in all these counties, I’m not sure how by having fewer Democrats run would meet that goal." One hundred years is a long time and a lot of races to count. We decided to check out Long’s claim and see whether old state ballots contained more Democratic candidates. Long left a public relations job to start Better Georgia, an affiliate of the ProgressNow network. Employees of the left-leaning group call themselves political troublemakers and highlight GOP policies with which they disagree. For full disclosure, Long is a former Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter who has also reported for CNN. We first saw the exchange between Long and Berlon reported on the AJC’s Political Insider blog. Long also provided us with his full quote from the event. He also provided his research of the past seven statewide elections, from 2000 to 2012, with data compiled from the Georgia secretary of state’s website. Long’s chart showed the total number of Democrats on the general election ballot for the state House and Senate for those years. We reviewed his provided numbers on the state website and found that within a few candidates in some years, Long’s data were mostly accurate. Year House Senate Total Democratic candidates 2012 86 26 112 2010 118 34 152 2008 99 35 134 2006 110 36 146 2004 123 43 166 2002 132 42 174 2000 133 42 175 "Even with the state’s increasing diversity, the number of Democratic candidates has decreased," Long told us. "Demographics don’t win elections. It’s about putting candidates on the field to challenge for those seats." Long did not provide 100-year data to support his claim. He based his statement on the decreasing number of Democrats on the ballot (with a minor exception in 2010) since 2002, when Sonny Perdue was elected governor. "Before that (2002) it’s an assumption because the Democrats were in control of everything," Long said. "The Democrats were the majority party." But the pure numbers don’t really mean anything in terms of candidates, Berlon told us. "It’s problematic to run a candidate in every race when you are the party not in power," he said. "... We’ve been targeting races we think we can win because we have a limited amount of resources." We went further with our research, reviewing the numbers as far back as 1988, the earliest data available on the secretary of state’s elections website. Those figures -- with the exception of 1994 and 1992, which were not available online -- showed that Democratic ballot representation didn’t fall below the 171 candidates in 1998. But Long’s comment went back 100 years, and around here we aim to be totally accurate, so we also went back 100 years -- at least we tried to. We pored over all the volumes of the Georgia Official and Statistical Register from 1923 to 1990 for more information. The register included ballot information for 1980-1990, 1970-1974 and 1966. State legislative data for all other years was not included, and elections officials were researching whether the information was available elsewhere. For the years that were available, the Democratic candidates on the state ballots numbered in the 200s, up to 256 candidates in 1966. Until 2002, Democrats held about 60 percent of the state’s legislative seats, said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock, who tracks state political trends. In the 1980s Democrats held about 80 percent of the General Assembly’s seats. But it’s not uncommon for the minority party to have a harder time recruiting candidates, Bullock said. So does Long’s claim pass the test of time? He said that Georgia’s 2012 general election ballot included fewer Democratic candidates for the state House and Senate than in the past 100 years. State elections data that are available for the previous 46 years confirm Long’s claim. Data before this point were not readily available to check. And there is a 42-year gap when information is not available. Long’s overall point that 2012 was a light year for Democrats is correct. But he overreaches when he tries to stretch those numbers back a century. A lot of context -- and years -- are missing from his statement. We rated his claim Half True.

Tongues started wagging again in recent weeks after Johnson fired off another head-scratcher. Johnson, a Democrat, had offered his support for legislation to end a federal loophole that does not require manufacturers to label fur and fake fur garments that cost less than $150. "Exporters use this loophole to deceptively sell products made from cat and dog fur as though they were made from faux fur or the fur of other animals," Johnson wrote in comments submitted for the Congressional Record. The congressman added that it is illegal to import, export, sell or advertise domestic dog fur in this country. Johnson is running for re-election against Republican Liz Carter in Georgia's 4th Congressional District, which includes most of DeKalb and portions of Gwinnett and Rockdale counties. So is the use of cats and dogs for fur really a problem, or is Johnson barking up the wrong tree? It is indeed a problem, one high-ranking animal rights leader told AJC PolitiFact Georgia. Michael Markarian, chief operating officer of the Humane Society of the United States, said some dog and cat fur still comes undetected into the U.S., particularly from China. About one in eight fur garments falls below the labeling standard, said U.S. Rep Jim Moran (D-Va.). The Humane Society recently tested 38 fur-trimmed jackets. Three had fur from domestic dogs, Markarian said. Some were from raccoon dogs, a canine species specific to Asia, the Humane Society official said. Those canines, Markarian said, are often skinned alive. "We really feel that this is still a problem and consumers need to have more confidence in what they're buying," Markarian said. Markarian said legislation is needed because more fur-rimmed jackets are being sold here and advertised as faux fur. It's not, he said. The Humane Society reached out-of-court settlements in March with Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue to stop advertising garments as faux fur that are trimmed with coyote or dog pelts. The settlements came after a District of Columbia judge in February fined Neiman Marcus $25,000 for advertising items as faux that were actually trimmed with raccoon dog, the St. Petersburg Times reported. Investigators for an animal rights group, meanwhile, recorded footage of what is said to be a raccoon dog being skinned alive in China as part of the fur trade. Chinese officials have vowed to stop the trade of cat and dog fur, calling it "illegal and barbaric," according to news reports. The Chinese State Forestry Administration pledged in 2005 to strengthen animal welfare regulations on animals farmed for fur. Congress passed legislation in 2000 that prohibits importing or exporting dog and cat fur. But animal rights activists say some manufacturers are still finding ways around the law. Moran, the congressman from Virginia, is the lead sponsor of legislation that would remove the loophole, which was created in 1951. The resolution unanimously passed the House of Representatives on July 28. Johnson was one of 170 sponsors. It has not gone before the U.S. Senate. Johnson's comments caught us off-guard, but the issue of cats and dogs being used as fur and their inhumane treatment is a problem. We rate his statement on the issue as True.

pomt-07132	Milwaukee’s police chief can fire officers "for basically no cause."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/16/robin-vos/wisconsin-rep-robin-vos-says-milwaukees-police-chi/	In Madison, plenty of familiar fights are being fought as Republicans who control the Legislature seek to undo changes approved when Democrats were in charge. An unexpected issue -- pay for fired Milwaukee police officers -- joined the list when Republicans introduced a budget amendment that would require city taxpayers to pay wages and benefits for some fired cops while they appealed their dismissals. That had long been the practice in Milwaukee. In some cases, dismissed officers collected pay for years while their appeals dragged on. They kept it even if their firing ultimately was upheld by the Fire and Police Commission. That changed in the wake of the Frank Jude beating case. In 2004, Jude was attacked by off-duty Milwaukee police officers after he left a party on the south side. Nine officers were fired for their role in incident, and public outrage mounted as officers received pay while they fought their dismissals. In 2008, the Legislature cut off pay immediately for officers who were fired for behavior that resulted in serious charges. At that time, city officials said taxpayers had paid fired officers $4.4 million in pay and benefits since 1990, including $400,000 alone for the officers involved in the Jude case. In 2009, the law was expanded, cutting off pay for officers fired for other reasons, such as department rule violations. That covers nearly all fired officers, because rule violations such as lying are the most common reason for firing. The new amendment, to return to the 2008 system, which focused on serious infractions, was authored by state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee. The issue is a hot button one: The union representing officers has traditionally fought to have dismissed cops kept on the payroll as long as possible. Meanwhile, the chief’s authority is diminished when a cop he fires remains on the payroll. When the amendment was adopted at a June 2, 2011, committee meeting, Vos said the change was needed because Milwaukee is the only city that allows its police chief to fire officers "for basically no cause." He continued: "That’s an awful lot of power we don’t grant to any other police chief in the state." That caught our attention, especially since the earlier changes were billed as putting Milwaukee more in line with other communities. Does the Milwaukee police chief really have such unbridled powers? Can he really fire someone for no reason? The short answer: No. The longer answer: State law spells out how the Milwaukee Police Department is organized and managed. They key provision on this point: "No member of the police force or fire department may be discharged or suspended for a term exceeding 30 days by the chief of either of the departments except for cause and after trial under this section." Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn put it another way: "Maybe he’s confused between just cause and just ‘cause." As in, "just because." State law spells out seven standards that must be met before a Milwaukee police officer can be fired. They include such things as whether the chief has "substantial evidence" that a rule was broken, has conducted a fair investigation and whether the officer knew that his or her actions could have serious consequences. A fired officer has 10 days to file an appeal with the Fire and Police Commission. Asked about the statement, Vos aide Kit Beyer said: "He misspoke. He hasn’t said it since then." When Vos returned our call, he said: "Do I understand that you have to have a reason (to fire an officer)? "Yes." What is Vos trying to accomplish with the amendment? He says fired police officers should be treated the same throughout the state. Officers elsewhere are suspended with pay by the chief and the firing is done by the local fire and police commission, he said. In Milwaukee, the chief fires an officer and then the officer could suffer months without pay and benefits while waiting for his appeal to be heard, Vos said. But the amendment does not change the sequence in Milwaukee to match other communities. It simply requires that officers fired for rules violations be paid during appeal. Vos argues keeping them on the payroll would encourage the fire and police commission to swiftly resolve the matter. However, city officials say when that system was in place it encouraged officers to drag out the appeals process. The net effect of the amendment is financial, said Michael Tobin, executive director of the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission. "It will allow most (fired) officers to remain on the payroll, because most are charged with rule violations" rather than crimes, Tobin said. Since taking over as chief in January 2008, Flynn has dismissed about 20 officers, almost all for rule violations. Tobin said the amendment would allow the officers to collect at least an additional two months of pay and benefits, because the commission must wait 60 days before scheduling an appeals hearing. Those charged with more serious offenses would not receive pay. So what’s our verdict? Vos argued state law must be changed because the Milwaukee chief can fire officers for no cause. That’s False … even Vos acknowledged it.	None	Robin Vos	None	None	None	2011-06-16T15:30:08	2011-06-02	['None']
pomt-11650	"In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/jan/12/gwen-graham/did-ron-desantis-cast-deciding-vote-against-legisl/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gwen Graham called out her newest Republican opponent Ron DeSantis for going to bat for oil drilling off Florida’s coast. Her Jan. 4 tweet came as the White House prepared to announce a new offshore drilling plan that originally included Florida among states that would see expanded drilling. (The White House later walked it back to exempt Florida at the urging of Gov. Rick Scott.) When DeSantis had the opportunity to keep drilling out of Florida, Graham said, he went against it. "In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling," Graham tweeted. "Will Congressman DeSantis stand up for Florida or is he too scared of losing @realDoanldTramp's endorsement?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet included a link to a close vote on a 2013 amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act (HR 2231), which never became law. Was DeSantis, whose district includes several east coast beaches, really "the deciding vote" on an effort to keep drilling out of the state? The short answer: It’s hard to say there is ever such a thing as "the deciding vote" with close calls in Congress. DeSantis’ stance on drilling DeSantis’ specific position on drilling is squishy. Most recently, DeSantis embraced Scott's opposition to Trump's plan. "In Florida our coastline is so important to our economy, it’s important to property values, it’s important to tourism," DeSantis said on Fox & Friends. "And we need to protect our coastline." Other actions speak to support for the coast, including a December 2015 letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management against seismic airgun exploration and a letter in opposition to the 2017 Interior Department executive order that advanced offshore oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. There’s also his vote in favor of a failed amendment that would have banned seismic testing in areas bordering Florida. He was one of 24 Republicans to vote for the testing ban. He also voted for a Graham amendement that would have restricted funds being used for the research, investigation, or study of offshore drilling. But that's not to say that DeSantis has always voted against drilling. DeSantis' down vote The 210-209 vote in Graham's tweet happened years earlier. In the summer of 2013, then-U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, proposed an amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act pushed by House Republicans. The larger bill aimed to expand U.S. offshore energy production by directing the U.S. Interior Department secretary to implement a five-year oil and gas leasing program off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Grayson’s amendment would have ensured the ability of Florida or any state to prohibit the use of drilling within its boundaries. At the time, Grayson said the amendment would have avoided the possibility of the federal government overriding states' rights to decide. When it came to a vote, Grayson’s amendment failed by one vote, and DeSantis voted against the amendment. The larger bill passed the House but did move past the Democratic-controlled Senate. Does that mean he was the "deciding vote?" There’s no doubt that DeSantis’ vote was crucial. But as we have concluded in fact-checks of similar attacks, the "deciding vote" label could just as easily be applied to any other lawmaker who voted on his side — making the term a bit meaningless. (Many Democrats were attacked as being the deciding vote on the narrowly passed Affordable Care Act, for example.) That’s the general rule. We wondered if DeSantis did anything to justify being singled out, such as holding his support until the last moment. We couldn’t spot from C-SPAN footage whether DeSantis was one of the members who changed his mind at the literal last minute. Even if he were, however, he would not have been the only lawmaker to do so. Graham spokesman Matt Harringer argued it is noteworthy that DeSantis was in the minority of Florida Republicans who voted against this amendment. Seven Florida Republicans, including DeSantis, voted against the amendment, while nine Republicans voted for the amendment. Is Grayson’s amendment significant? DeSantis’ team didn’t argue his vote, but they did take issue with Graham’s framing of the measure as a vote "against our state’s right to protect Florida waters from drilling." Many Republicans didn’t see it that way, arguing Grayson’s measure would not have actually changed Florida’s control of its coast. "Since the underlying bill did nothing to alter the existing relationship between the federal and state governments, the amendment itself contained no substantive policy that would have changed the ability of Florida to prevent development of waters within its jurisdiction," said DeSantis spokeswoman Elizabeth Fusick. Fusick said the balance of power between the federal and state government was already determined by the Submerged Lands Act (which sets federal government ownership of submerged lands after the first three miles from the state’s coast) and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (which also applies to land beyond three miles offshore), which were both enacted in 1953. Holly Parker, the Florida regional manager for the Surfrider Foundation, said that if Grayson’s amendment only applied to state waters, then it would seem to be a duplication of an existing right. However, she said it’s possible that the broader failed legislation would have changed that. "Now, if the underlying legislation somehow impeded those state rights and this amendment was an attempt to clarify or delineate the rights of a state to regulate those submerged (lands), that would be different," Parker said. Athan Manuel, the director of the Sierra Club’s Land’s Protection Program, said he thinks it's possible that the bill could have changed the separation of powers. Regardless, he said, the point of Grayson’s amendment was to be "extra clear" that Florida had a say in what happened. "Maybe it wasn’t as necessary, but it's important to send the right message," Manuel said. "If he wanted to vote against drilling, he should have voted for the Grayson amendment." Our ruling Graham said DeSantis casted the "deciding vote against" the state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling. There’s no question that DeSantis’ vote on an amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act was crucial, but saying DeSantis was the deciding vote goes too far. Technically, any of the 209 other people who voted against the bill could be considered the "deciding vote." Furthermore, the significance of Grayson’s amendment is a subject of debate. Democrats saw it as securing Florida’s right to protect Florida waters, whereas Republicans say the amendment wouldn’t have changed the powers of the state. With everything considered, we rate this claim Half True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Gwen Graham	None	None	None	2018-01-12T10:53:35	2018-01-04	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-09190	"The president has added close to 68,000 troops in the last year, since he came into office, not just the 30,000 you hear, but the others that were added before that."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/30/colin-powell/obama-has-increased-troops-afghanistan/	Appearing on ABC News' This Week, retired Gen. Colin Powell answered questions about whether the U.S. had enough troops in Afghanistan. Host Jake Tapper reminded Powell of the military thinking that many call "the Powell doctrine," the idea that military operations should have large enough troop deployments to achieve their objectives. Tapper described it first as "overwhelming" force, but Powell said it is better described as "decisive" force. Is the Obama administration "adhering to the Powell doctrine?" Tapper asked. Powell didn't give a yes or no answer, instead explaining, "The president has added close to 68,000 troops in the last year, since he came into office, not just the 30,000 you hear, but the others that were added before that. So 68,000 troops were added to it. That is a significant number. And, remember, they're not going after a fixed enemy. They're trying to control ground. They're trying to give some comfort to people that their life is going to get better." Powell said the rest will be up to the government and people of Afghanistan. "The challenge here -- and the president will have to face this late next year, as he said he would -- is, okay, we have had this additional input of 68,000 soldiers, bringing it to over 100,000 soldiers. We have done what we said we were going to do. Have the Afghans done what they must do, build an army that is capable, an army that is connected to the central government, an army that the people believe in? And do we have a police force that is not corrupt? And do we have a government in Kabul that is really reaching out and connecting the people together into some kind of political system that people believe in?" We wanted to fact-check Powell's statement that Obama has added 68,000 troops, "not just the 30,000 you hear." After weeks of deliberations, Obama in late 2009 decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. He announced his decision in a major address at U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., on Dec. 1, 2009. But Obama had sent more troops to Afghanistan long before that, to fulfill a campaign promise. On Feb. 17, 2009, Obama issued an order to send two additional brigades -- each with about 2,500 troops -- to Afghanistan. With those troops plus other additions, the total deployment steadily increased from the roughly 34,000 that were in Afghanistan when Obama took office. Last week, the Pentagon announced there were 94,000 troops in Afghanistan. The number was a milestone because it was the first time troops there had exceeded the number of troops in Iraq, which now has 92,000. (At the height of the Iraq war, there were between 130,000 and 172,000 troops there.) About 4,000 more troops are expected to deploy to Afghanistan by the summer, bringing the total to 98,000. So 98,000 minus the 34,000 that were there when Obama took office gives us 64,000 troops, a little shy of the 68,000 Powell mentioned. But he might be counting additional NATO troops from countries that include Britain, France, Germany and Italy. NATO countries pledged an additional 5,000 troops last year, but the numbers have fluctuated as actual deployments have occurred. One thing we've learned about fact-checking troop numbers: Troops rotate in and out of countries on a regular schedule, which means troop levels are approximate numbers and change as time goes by. Still, we find Powell's numbers very close to the mark. Obama took office with about 34,000 troops. There are now 94,000 troops and closing in on 98,000 troops by summer. When you count small additions by NATO, that gets us close to 68,000. We rate his statement True.	None	Colin Powell	None	None	None	2010-05-30T14:41:17	2010-05-30	['None']
pomt-11706	BREAKING: Illegal Muslim From Iran Arrested For Starting California Wildfire	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2017/dec/20/usa-front/pants-fire-fabricated-claim-about-muslim-immigrant/	Facebook users recently spotted a suspicious article about the deadly Northern California wildfires, through the social network’s initiative that allows readers to flag fake news. Given the steady flow of misleading and intentionally false claims about the cause of the fires, PolitiFact California decided to fact-check the article, which appears to have been posted Dec. 11, 2017. It’s from the website USA In Front and includes a sensational headline: BREAKING: ILLEGAL MUSLIM FROM IRAN ARRESTED FOR STARTING CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE The article lists "a 23-year-old man named Muhammad Islam" as "the actual person responsible for the fire," citing Fox News as the source of the information. We found the network never reported that. Before we examine the story and what appears to be its clearly false assertion, here’s some background on the destruction of the fires. The wind-driven blazes that started Oct. 8, 2017 are the most deadly series of fires in California’s history. They killed 42 people across Northern California and destroyed more than 8,400 homes, businesses and other buildings. Much of the damage was centered in Napa and Sonoma counties. Our research We started our fact-check by contacting the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, the agency in charge of investigating the cause of the blazes. Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean said there have been no arrests, contradicting the claim in the article. "All the major fires that occurred in October are still being investigated. No arrests have been made in reference to the October siege," McLean wrote. We reached out to USA In Front for comment but did not hear back. The website lists its owner as USA In Front Inc., though we were unable to find out where it is based. The site appears to allow users to create an account and submit content. It includes articles on news and politics with a right-wing bent with headlines such as "Poll: Should Barack Obama Lose His Presidential Pension?" to "Meet The Most Liberal, Fiscally Irresponsible, and Pro-Death Republican in Texas." Article’s origin We found the story about the arrest of a Muslim man did not start with USA In Front. In October, the fact-checking website Snopes.com, found this tale originated on a site, FreedomJunkshun, that describes its content as satire. Snopes found "none of the details are based in fact, and the Fox News report mentioned in the article also does not exist." But what started on the satirical site didn’t stay there. The story circulated around the web, and was posted word-for-word on sites such as World Today 365 and USA In Front. Those websites presented the story as news without any mention of its satirical origin. When we first examined the article, we noticed a few red flags: It does not have a byline, so there’s no direct way to contact the person that wrote the story. Unlike traditional, credible news articles, the story does not have a date or dateline. Additionally, the article fails to cite any specific people as sources. This is not the only time USA In Front has been flagged. The national PolitiFact handed out a Pants On Fire earlier this month for the site’s made-up story that Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer had an affair with a teenage cheerleader. PolitiFact maintains a list of more than 300 websites, as of November 2017, where it’s found deliberately false or fake stories. The national website describes it this way: "This is by no means a complete list of offenders. Nor does it mean every post on these websites is fake. But in most cases, these sites work hard to fool readers, and you should take that into consideration if should you see a link being shared from one." Breitbart’s false claim The story posted on USA In Front has some parallels to a claim in a Breitbart article PolitiFact California rated False in October. Breitbart’s article said an undocumented immigrant from Mexico "was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents." In reality, an undocumented man had been arrested for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. Sonoma County sheriff’s officials called out Breitbart for fueling the false rumors. State fire authorities said they had not identified an arson suspect nor determined whether arson was the cause of the fires. Breitbart’s article, or versions of it, quickly spread across right-wing media outlets, including InfoWars and the Drudge Report, which shared Breitbart's unsubstantiated claims -- as detailed by BuzzFeed News. After fact-checkers pointed out the false claim, Breitbart added an "update" saying the man was not suspected of starting the deadly fires. Our ruling A story recently posted on the website USA In Front claimed a Muslim man had been arrested for starting the deadly Northern California wildfires. The website and others presented the claim as if it were news, though it originated as a false tale on a satirical website. A spokesman for the state’s fire agency, Cal Fire, told us there had been no arrests and that the cause of the fires remains under investigation. The article on USA In Front is another example of the many fabricated claims tied to the deadly blazes. It lacks a byline, any specific sources and any disclaimer about its origin as satire. We didn’t hear back from the website. Posting the story without this key warning is reckless and perpetuates false and damaging information. We rate the claim in the USA In Front article Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. Editor’s Note: In December 2016, PolitiFact.com joined a coalition of fact-checkers who agreed to work with Facebook to try to slow the spread of misinformation in people’s news feeds. The above article by PolitiFact California is a result of that partnership. Facebook introduced a new tool after the 2016 campaign that allows users to mark a post as a "false news story," and if enough do, the post is sent to fact-checkers such as PolitiFact, Snopes and Factcheck.org. If the fact-checkers find the story to be "false," a warning label is attached to the original post in Facebook’s news feed, and Facebook’s algorithm makes it more difficult for the disputed post to spread virally.

pomt-13816	"95 percent of the world’s customers are … beyond our shores."	half-true	/global-news/statements/2016/jul/15/joe-biden/touting-trade-joe-biden-says-95-percent-worlds-con/	International trade has become a big issue in the 2016 presidential race, and now the sitting vice president, Joe Biden, has devoted a speech to it as well. Speaking on July 13 in San Diego, Biden reminded his audience that the United States needs to -- and has been -- cracking down on unfair practices by its trading partners. However, Biden also made a case for the benefits of foreign trade -- an argument that the two presidential candidates, and especially Republican Donald Trump, have not often made this campaign season. At one point in his speech, Biden cited the sheer number of customers outside U.S. borders. "We need to sell to customers abroad. 95 percent of the world’s customers are over there. They’re beyond our shores,  95 percent of the world’s customers," he said. This is a commonly cited figure by advocates of expanding international trade, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And it’s rooted in legitimate statistics. But it glosses over some important context. Where the number comes from The 95 percent figure is drawn directly from global population figures. According to the World Bank, the United States has a population of 321.4 million, compared to 7.3 billion for the world as a whole. So the United States’ population represents about 4.4 percent of the world’s population, leaving 95.6 percent of people outside the United States’ borders. That’s very close to the figure Biden offered. Why the statistic doesn’t tell the whole story However, for the purposes of buying American products -- which was the point of Biden’s remark -- not all residents of the world are equal. The vast majority of people across the world are quite poor and will not generally be in the market for American products. Determining how many "customers" there might be for American products is tricky. But one estimate published by the World Bank broke down the world’s population into rich (incomes typical of Italy and above), middle class (incomes between Brazil and Italy), and poor (incomes below that of Brazil). The study included affluent residents of poor countries in its count of "rich" and "middle class" people. That report estimated that in 2000, about 10.5 percent of the world’s population was rich and another 7.6 percent was middle class. By contrast, 82 percent were poor. Here’s the full chart: Of course, some of that 82 percent might be able to afford the occasional U.S. product, whether it’s a bottle of Coke, some bread made from U.S. grain, or a summer blockbuster movie. That uncertainty about the definition of "poor" and whether even very poor people can afford some U.S. products some of the time make us reluctant to suggest an alternate, more accurate figure. Still, even a narrower World Bank calculation -- based on defining "extreme poverty" as $1.90 in income per day adjusted for purchasing power by country -- came up with 12.73 percent of the world’s population living in "extreme poverty" in 2013. That’s not a lot of money to spend on imported products. And raising the cutoff for the definition of "extreme poverty" would produce larger percentages of people in that category. Pluses and minuses of using the 95 percent figure The vice president’s office acknowledged this critique and told PolitiFact that it likes to use the term "potential customers," arguing that beneficial trade agreements can help turn non-consumers of U.S. products into consumers of U.S. products, especially over the long term as trading relationships deepen and incomes rise. And even under the current status quo, some experts cautioned against dismissing the 95 percent figure. " 'Customers' is about population, not income, and while I'd agree that a lot of them won't be very big customers -- the 10 percent or so of the planet's population who live on less than $1.90 a day aren't lining up to buy Boeing 777s -- many of the world's very poorest people do buy food, and the United States is a very big agricultural exporter, including to developing countries," Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. "So, they may not be the biggest customers, but they will be customers nonetheless." Our ruling Biden said, "95 percent of the world’s customers are … beyond our shores." He’s right if you count the number of people across the globe who live outside the borders of the United States. However, since many members of that 95 percent are quite poor, framing the question as Biden did gives an overstated sense of how much that 95 percent will be consuming U.S. exports in the near future.

pomt-13830	"A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-correctly-says-20-veterans-commit-sui/	Topping Donald Trump’s 10-point plan to help U.S. military veterans is a pledge to improve their mental health services. "A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans," the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said during a July 11 speech in Virginia Beach, where he excoriated the Department of Veterans Affairs and laid out reforms. We wondered whether Trump’s sad suicide number is correct. His campaign pointed us to research the VA released on July 7 in advance of the agency’s planned publication this month of its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides. The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, that 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 veterans a day. The count updates a much-cited VA estimate that an average of 22 veterans killed themselves each day in 2010. The VA always acknowledged that this old study was limited, because it was based on veterans living in only 21 states. Notably absent were California and Texas - two states with very high veteran populations. The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state. The VA said that 65 percent of veterans who took their own lives in 2014 were 50 or older, a finding that jibes with Trump’s statement that the daily suicides especially pertained to "older veterans." For context, it should be noted that 75 percent of the nation’s veterans are 50 or older. On the other hand, the VA found that younger veterans had the highest rate of suicides. Those ages 18 to 29 had a suicide rate of 77 per 100,000 in 2014. Veterans ages 50 to 59, by comparison, had a rate of 39 per 100,000. In all age groups, the VA found that the percentage of veterans who take their lives was substantially higher than that of adults who never served in the military. The rate for non-veterans ages 18 to 29, for example, was 12.8 per 100,000. The rate for non-vets ages 50 to 59 was 18.6 per 100,000. The 2014 suicide rate for all veterans was 35.3 per 100,000; the rate for all adult non-vets was 15.2 per 100,000. After adjusting for differences in age and gender, the VA concluded that veterans have a 21 percent higher risk of suicide than non-serving adults. Is the situation improving? During a July 7 news conference, VA officials were asked whether their research shows that there has been improvement in the veteran suicide problem, since the updated number, 20 deaths a day, was lower than the previous estimate of 22. David Shulkin, the VA’s undersecretary for health, said the department doesn’t view the new number as a sign of progress. Shulkin said the average number of daily suicides may decreasing because the aging population of veterans also is waning. He stressed, however, that the suicide rate for veterans was rising. VA figures show that the veterans suicide rate actually has increased 32 percent since 2001. That compares with a 23 percent increase in the rate for non-vets during the same period. According to the new report, the suicide rate among veterans who used VA services increased 8.8 percent since 2001, while the rate among veterans who didn’t use those services increased 38.6 percent. Critics have said focusing on the daily number of veteran suicides is pointless and that attention should be fixed on examining the veteran suicide rate and how it compares with the rest of the country. Shulkin, during the news conference, said the daily suicide rate figure has become so "ingrained" in public conversation that the VA decided to recalculate it to ensure it’s correct. Our ruling Trump said, "A shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans." His claim is supported by recent research by the VA and we rate the statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5c79ae1-2a18-49c8-a325-8e1146fc012e	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-14T11:18:12	2016-07-11	['None']
pomt-10080	"Senator McCain would pay for part of his (health care) plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare — $882-billion worth."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/barack-obama/obama-knows-mccains-intentions-better-than-mccain/	(Published Oct. 20, 2008) Though both presidential candidates have spoken at length about how they would change the American health system, they’ve carefully avoided offering many specifics about Medicare, the government’s huge health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. For good reason: Medicare is financially unprepared for the surge of retiring baby boomers, meaning future administrations and Congresses will have to consider making tough tradoffs, like cutting benefits or raising taxes. That’s hardly the kind of stuff a politician would willingly highlight in stump speeches or on a campaign Web site. It is the sort of thing you just might accuse your opponent of favoring. And Barack Obama in recent days has tried to do just that, portraying John McCain’s health plan as filled with looming spending cuts for Medicare’s nearly 45-million beneficiaries. "It turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare — $882-billion worth. $882-billion in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived health care plan, even as Medicare already faces a looming shortfall," Obama said in an Oct. 17, 2008, speech in Roanoke, Va. He repeated the charge the next day, in St. Louis, declaring that under McCain’s plan, “you would have fewer places to get care, and less freedom to choose your doctors. You’ll pay more for your drugs, receive fewer services, and get lower quality care.” The Obama campaign also has turned the charge into a TV ad. Obama might be hitting hard on a sensitive topic, but in the process, he’s offering more specifics about McCain’s plan than McCain has. The $882-billion in cuts Obama cites comes from an analysis of McCain’s plan by the Center for American Progress Fund, a left-leaning think tank headed by John D. Podesta, the former chief of staff to President Clinton. The analysis, in turn, is based on an estimate by the independent Tax Policy Center that finds McCain’s overall health plan would cost the government $1.3-trillion over 10 years — a figure the McCain campaign doesn’t dispute. Because McCain’s campaign says the health plan would be “budget neutral” — meaning it would be paid for by savings from Medicare and Medicaid — the Center for American Progress automatically assumes the savings would come from cuts to the big health programs. The center performed a series of calculations to determine how much McCain would have to reduce both programs’ projected spending growth, and concluded McCain would have to pare the program by roughly 13 percent over a decade, or $882-billion. All fine, except that McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan. Instead, his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs and assorted other steps. McCain’s senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin has talked about further policy changes, including extending tax credits so some low-income Americans wouldn’t have to enroll in Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor. But he has stressed that the cost of these changes could be covered without cutting benefits or services. McCain’s campaign responded to Obama's Roanoke remarks, saying the Democratic front-runner was committing “Medicare malpractice” and spreading lies by perpetuating the Center for American Progress Fund analysis. It’s unclear whether McCain could extract sufficient savings using the methods he’s outlined to achieve his "budget neutral" goal. Still, the Center for American Progress Fund analysis flatly assumes McCain will cut Medicare benefits and services when McCain has not even broached the idea in speeches or statements. Obama is overstepping by repeating the analysis’ conclusion and portraying the dollar amount of the cuts as part and parcel of McCain’s plan. We rule his claim False.

pomt-09030	"When you were casting your vote for Republicans, Brian Kemp was voting for Democrats."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/07/doug-macginnitie/secretary-state-hopeful-doug-macginnitie-said-repu/	The barnyard brawl otherwise known as the Republican primary for Georgia secretary of state reached a new political milestone: its first attack ad. And guess what? Secretary of State Brian Kemp, your rival Doug MacGinnitie says you should be ashamed. MacGinnitie's commercial, which he posted on YouTube, emerged in an online skirmish over which of the two Republicans is a better Republican. On June 9, Kemp posted on YouTube a speech he made during a Cobb County GOP breakfast in which he accused MacGinnitie of failing to vote in a Republican primary for two decades. We ruled that claim False in an earlier item. MacGinnitie, a former Sandy Springs city councilman, fired back June 23 with an attack ad on his campaign's YouTube page. It said that Kemp, a Gov. Sonny Perdue appointee who said he helped build the GOP in Georgia, voted in Democratic primaries. "When you were casting your vote for Republicans, Brian Kemp was voting for Democrats," a voice said on the YouTube video. Kemp defected three times: 1996, 1998 and 2000, according to the announcer. "Saying one thing and doing another -- that’s hypocrisy. You should be ashamed," it concludes. A Republican candidate voted for a Democrat? Say it ain't so. We requested Kemp's voting history from the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, which keeps election records. They show Kemp did cast votes in three state Democratic primaries: 1996, 1998 and 2000. This means that Kemp voted three times for Democrats, as the commercial said. But those same records also show those votes were exceptions to the rule. Kemp has voted 33 times since 1992. Of his votes in primary elections, eight were in Republican contests: the 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 presidential primaries; and the 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 state primaries. Kemp also voted in three other Republican races: two state primary runoffs (2002 and 2006) and a special election in 2007. Kemp voted in Democratic primaries to have a say in local politics, campaign consultant Joel McElhannon said. He lives in Clarke County, where Athens is located. Historically, the area has been so heavily Democratic that many conservatives run as Democrats, McElhannon said. Some races are decided in the Democratic primary. "To have input in local offices like County Commission -- where decisions are made that directly impact his businesses and his family’s quality of life -- Brian voted in a few Democrat primaries in the '90s to support conservative, pro-business local candidates running in those Democrat primaries," McElhannon wrote in an e-mail. Elections records support the Kemp campaign's assessment. In the 2000 general primary, in which Kemp chose a Democratic ballot, there were no Republican challengers in several races, according to Athens-Clarke County Board of Elections records. They included contests for sheriff, two county commissioner seats and two state House slots. Although Democrats have become less dominant in Clarke during the past decade, they remain a driving force in local politics. In the 2008 Clarke general primary, Kemp was among only 39 percent of voters who chose a Republican ballot, according to Georgia secretary of state records. Sixty-one percent of voters selected a Democratic ballot. While MacGinnitie is correct that Kemp voted in three Democratic primaries, his conclusion that his opponent is guilty of "hypocrisy" is misleading. It ignores the political dynamics of Kemp's home county as well the bulk of his voting history. We rate MacGinnitie's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12140	On Foxconn deal, "3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways. Break it down: more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars per job."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/11/melissa-sargent/wisconsin-offering-pay-taiwan-tech-firm-foxconn-1-/	When Republican Gov. Scott Walker said iPhone manufacturer Foxconn was bringing 13,000 jobs to Wisconsin, we drew the line on his exuberance at Half True. Even the Taiwanese company itself has said only there is potential for 13,000 jobs, and that its initial plans call for 3,000. But some Democrats, including state Rep. Melissa Sargent of Madison, have also been overly effusive in criticizing the up to $3 billion in incentives Walker wants to give Foxconn. Sargent, who made news in early 2017 for proposals to legalize marijuana and eliminate the state’s "tampon tax," posted this tweet on Aug. 2, 2017 -- a week after Foxconn announced in the East Room at the White House that it had chosen Wisconsin for its first major American factory: 3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways. Break it down: more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars per job. #foxconn She had already made the claim in her official newsletter. The idea that the state would pay incentives to Foxconn worth more than $1 million per job might sound absurd on its face. And as we’ll see, Sargent took down her tweet. But we are talking some colossal numbers here. Half-a-million dollars per job, anyone? No, it’s not $1 million per job Under the deal it made with the state, Foxconn agrees to invest $10 billion to construct a facility in Wisconsin and create up to 13,000 jobs. Wisconsin agrees to, among other things, provide up to $3 billion in incentives. Sargent’s staff told us her $1 million-per-job claim was based on a column posted on the Bloomberg Businessweek website that was written by Tim Culpan. Culpan is a Taiwan-based technology columnist for Bloomberg Gadfly, a commentary site. He wrote that Wisconsin "is paying as much as $1 million per job." Culpan’s $1 million claim was widely circulated -- by state Superintendent of Schools Tony Evers, who is weighing a run for governor in 2018; state Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse; and a host of national media, including Vanity Fair, a Washington Post columnist, The Atlantic and others. If you take $3 billion in incentives -- the amount cited in Sargent’s tweet -- and divide it by 3,000 jobs, you get $1 million per job. But the $3 billion is the maximum -- to be paid only if Foxconn meets several requirements, including creating 13,000 jobs. If fewer jobs are created, the incentives paid are less. So, what is the cost per job? What the per-job cost might be The $3 billion -- up to $200 million per year for 15 years -- would amount to nearly 50 times the previous record paid by Wisconsin taxpayers, when the state in 2010 offered $65 million in subsidies to keep Mercury Marine from moving a factory from Fond du Lac to Oklahoma. The nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates it would take 25 years for taxpayers to recover the bulk of that -- the $2.85 billion the state would be paying Foxconn in cash. (The other $150 million would be provided through a sales tax exemption.) As for the per-job cost, we turned to an analysis by the Wisconsin Budget Project. The project is part of Kids Forward, formerly known as the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a left-leaning nonprofit. The $2.85 billion in cash payments, according to the analysis, would amount to $219,000 per job if 13,000 jobs are created and $587,000 per job if 3,000 jobs are created. An important note: As the analysis and Culpan noted, and as economist Timothy Bartik of the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research told us, the more Foxconn gears its plant for robotics, the fewer jobs it will create -- and thus the per-job cost of the incentives will be higher. Asked about Sargent’s taking down her tweet, one of her staff members told us the Bloomberg column "was early," and that as more details of the incentive package were released, "it became clear that estimates were more nuanced, and Melissa removed the tweet to prevent any confusion or misinformation." The news reporting, however, had been clear: up to $3 billion in incentives only if 13,000 jobs were created, not 3,000. The staffer, citing the Wisconsin Budget Project analysis, also told us there will be costs to taxpayers beyond the $3 billion, such as local government spending on infrastructure improvements and state borrowing for Interstate 94 improvements. But Sargent’s tweet referred only to the $3 billion in incentives, not those other potential costs. Our rating In a tweet she later took down, Sargent said that on the Foxconn deal, "3,000 jobs cost #WI taxpayers more than $3 billion in tax giveaways. Break it down: more than $1 million in taxpayer dollars per job." The per-job cost could never reach $1 million if only 3,000 jobs are created; the full $3 billion would be paid only if 13,000 jobs are created. An analysis projects the per-job cost at $219,000 per job if 13,000 jobs are created and $587,000 per job if 3,000 jobs are created. We rate Sargent’s statement False.

pomt-00761	"Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/apr/15/tim-cook/apples-tim-cook-texas-considering-law-punish-clerk/	A Texas lawmaker’s attempt to restrict the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses drew backlash all the way from Silicon Valley. In an op-ed article for The Washington Post, Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook suggested certain states are being transparent in their efforts to discriminate against others, particularly those of the LGBT community. Cook, who announced he was gay in October 2014, used Texas as an example: "Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year." Cook was also speaking out against Indiana’s "Religious Freedom Restoration Act," which was signed into state law at the end of March by Republican Gov. Mike Pence. The law sparked a national outcry over whether it permitted businesses the ability to discriminate against customers based on religious beliefs, criticism that quieted after Indiana lawmakers amended the legislation to include specific protections for gays and lesbians. But this doesn’t mean other similar bills haven’t been filed in other state legislators including Texas. And is such legislation under consideration in the Lone Star state? Apple doesn't elaborate To our inquiry, Apple Inc. spokeswoman Rachel Wolf declined to say where Cook got his information or to otherwise comment. But we have a hunch Cook was referring to House Bill 623, filed by state Rep. Cecil Bell, R-Magnolia, on Jan. 7, 2015 and drew more than 40 House Republican co-authors though no senator filed a companion. Bell’s HB 623, titled the "Preservation of Sovereignty and Marriage Act," would block pay, pension and benefits of state or local government employees who issue a same-sex marriage license. Of course, hundreds of proposals are offered by legislators that don’t get voted on. And, given Apple Inc.’s silence, we don’t know how Cook decided this proposal was "being considered." In contrast, legislative records indicate HB 623 was referred to a House committee Feb 23 but as of April 14, 2015, more than two weeks after Cook spoke, hadn’t been set for a hearing, though Bell earlier told us he’d requested one. Bell told the Texas Tribune in January 2015 that he filed the proposal to prevent any federal court or federal action from allowing gay marriage in Texas. "The federal government is trying to act to create moral standards, and that’s just not acceptable," Bell said. By phone, Bell told us Cook’s description was a "correct assessment" of HB 623. He said county clerks are currently not authorized to issue same-sex marriage licenses in Texas, where the Constitution was amended in 2005 to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Bell said those same employees should not be compensated for doing activities that are against state law. "As with any job, we are subject to the laws that we’re working under," Bell said. HB 623 v. SCOTUS Next, we wondered if a state law can outflank a Supreme Court ruling. Along those lines, we hunted other perspectives. Here’s what’s coming up: On April 28, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a 150-minute argument regarding four gay marriage cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee challenging a law in each state. Then, before the court’s current term ends in June 2015, the justices are expected to make a ruling — potentially on whether gays and lesbians have the constitutional right to marry or states have the authority to decide restrictions one by one. Asked for his assessment, Jonathan Saenz of the conservative Texas Values group, which says it seeks "to preserve and advance a culture of family values," told us the court might stop short of a sweeping move. "No one knows how" the court will rule or even if it will rule, Saenz emailed. Also, he said, its "ruling may not settle or clarify anything." Another take: A January 2015 USA Today news article suggested that if the justices determine gays have a right to marry based on the 14th Amendment, and that states have to recognize these marriages when licensed by other states, then Texas’ gay marriage ban would no longer be upheld in federal court. Significantly, as hinted by Cook, Bell’s proposal includes language to supersede the Supreme Court, if necessary. Specifically, section "H" of his proposal states: "The State is not subject to suit in law or equity pursuant to the eleventh amendment of the United States Constitution for complying with the provisions of this section, regardless of a contrary federal court ruling." Dan Quinn of the liberal Austin-based Texas Freedom Network, which describes itself as "monitoring far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders," suggested this means that under HB 623, even if the Supreme Court endorses same-sex marriage, a Texas county clerk who issues a same-sex marriage license would face state penalties. "The intention here is to pass laws that would subvert a Supreme Court ruling striking down the same-sex marriage ban," Quinn said. Earlier, Bell told us if HB 623 makes it into law, litigation might prove necessary to resolve whether Texas government employees could be penalized for issuing same-sex marriage licenses even after the U.S. Supreme Court’s endorsement of gay marriage. "Conjecturally, it will call another lawsuit to determine the interaction between state laws and the power of the U.S. Supreme Court," Bell said. Not so fast, lawyers on opposite sides of the Supreme Court fight told us by phone. Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign, which says it’s the nation’s largest LGBT civil rights organization, and Lynn Wardle, a Brigham Young University law professor, each said that if the justices agree on a constitutional right to gay marriage, that judgment would apply in every state, regardless of state laws declaring otherwise. Wardle, who led in writing a March 2015 brief to the court pointing out the limited number of nations that allow gay marriage, said of the Texas proposal’s section H: "In all candor, that’s some state legislator-politician’s dream. It’s not reality. The states cannot say we are going to order our courts to not follow the Constitution." Warbelow called the section a kind of "court stripping," generally meaning an effort to eliminate a court’s duties. State legislators can try to do this for state, but not federal, courts, she said. Our ruling Cook said: "Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year." Cook fairly summarized Bell’s legislation. But clarification was missing in that the proposal wasn’t "being considered" by lawmakers either then or when we completed our review a couple of weeks later. Like a lot of bills, HB 623 awaited legislative attention. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-07774	"State employees haven't received a raise in five or six years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/22/florida-department-corrections-worker/state-worker-fires-back-gov-rick-scott-says-worker/	Some of the more than 100,000 faceless state workers that Florida Gov. Rick Scott has targeted as ways to slash government spending are standing up and pushing back. Scott has proposed cutting the state government payroll by roughly 10 percent over two years, wants employees to redirect 5 percent of their salary to retirement benefits, and is asking employees to accept cuts to their health care benefits. "If you work in the private sector, here's the things you have to do: Your overhead has to come down each and every year as a percentage of revenues. Every year," Scott said in defense of his budget proposal for 2011-13. "That has not happened in state government." But state government workers already have been asked to sacrifice plenty, some say. On Feb. 21, 2011, during a meet-and-greet with Department of Corrections workers in Tallahassee, Scott faced a pointed question from a corrections department employee about the proposed cuts. "You said to hold you accountable," the employee, speaking from the audience, said to Scott. "State employees have seen, since the Bush administration, a reduction in state employees. I have been with this agency for many years. And I've seen where our staff has been significantly cut. We are required to do more with less. State employees haven't received a raise in five or six years. You're asking us to contribute to our pension plan and contribute more to our insurance. My question is simple: What have you required for the wealthiest Floridians to contribute to the state revenues?" Scott didn't directly answer the question in his response, according to the St. Petersburg Times, and instead offered a quick lesson in capitalism. You can listen to the exchange here. The plight of state employees certainly has been an issue in Wisconsin, where Republican Gov. Scott Walker is trying to remove collective bargaining rights for many state workers, resulting in massive protests and counter-protests. The issue hasn't reached such a fever pitch in Florida, but Scott's proposals are being met with resistance from union groups and many legislators. Here at PolitiFact Florida, we plan to spend significant time checking claims about state workers, their benefits, and Scott's and the Legislature's plans. In this case, we wanted to check the claim by the state worker -- who was not identified in news stories -- that "state employees haven't received a raise in five or six years." The answer comes from the Florida Department of Management Services, which in effect serves as the state human resources agency. The department tracks general pay raises for state employees as part of its annual workforce report. State workers received a 3 percent general pay adjustment on Oct. 1, 2006, their last general wage increase. State workers did receive a $1,000 lump-sum bonus on Nov. 1, 2007, and eligible Florida Highway Patrol law enforcement employees received a 5 percent raise effective Oct. 1, 2008. There were no pay adjustments included in the 2009-10 or 2010-11 budget. Employees remain eligible for possible merit pay increases. As of June 30, 2010, the Department of Management Services reported that of the 105,031 people working in the state personnel system, more than 74,000 -- about 70 percent of them -- worked at a yearly salary of less than $40,000. A state employee asking a pointed question about Scott's proposal to cut benefits for state workers noted that state workers haven't received a raise in "five or six years." The last general pay adjustment for state employees occurred on Oct. 1, 2006, almost four years and five months ago. And state employees did receive a lump-sum $1,000 bonus in 2007, though that did not affect their salary rate. Those two details add more context to the worker's claim. We find this statement Mostly True.	None	Florida Department of Corrections worker	None	None	None	2011-02-22T17:41:16	2011-02-21	['None']
pomt-03784	On changing the rules governing judicial conflicts of interest	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/29/ed-fallone/roggensack-says-fallone-changed-positions-recusal/	In a campaign with few flash points, the March 22, 2013 exchange between Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack and challenger Ed Fallone qualified as a standout moment. At a debate organized by the State Bar of Wisconsin and We the People/Wisconsin, Fallone repeated his criticism of Roggensack for helping change a rule so that getting a campaign contribution from a litigant is not enough on its own to force a judge to step down from a case. Roggensack defended the rule change -- but also accused Fallone, a law professor at Marquette University, of changing his position from acceptance of the rule to aggressive criticism of it. "I do think his position is a bit different tonight," Roggensack said, comparing statements Fallone made in January to his criticism at the debate and in his TV ads. Time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to measure whether a political figure has changed positions. It’s not a measure of whether any change is good politics or good policy, just whether the person has been consistent. The rule in question was written after several years of intense election activity in Supreme Court races featuring big spending and fundraising by candidates and major TV ad buys by ideological interest groups for or against the candidates. In late 2008, the court began considering the standards for when a justice should recuse himself or herself from hearing a case. In 2009, on a 4-3 vote it decided endorsements, campaign contributions and independently run ads in themselves are not enough to force a judge off of a case. The judicial ethics code still requires recusal if the judge has personal bias toward a litigant, has business ties to lawyers in a case, has a financial stake in the outcome, a relative is involved or the judge has taken a public position on the issue. Roggensack defended the rule, saying it would block mischief by donors who later want to force a judge off a case. Judges, she noted, can still voluntarily remove themselves. Fallone says lawyers should be able to make a recusal motion solely because of concern over a campaign donation. Another important bit: Roggensack said in the 2013 campaign that the change was in line with the court’s earlier ruling in Donohoo v. Action Wisconsin. In that 2008 case, one side sought to have then-Justice Louis Butler removed from a case because Butler’s campaign had received a $300 donation from a lawyer for the other side, and was endorsed by another lawyer. The court ruled, with no dissenters, that neither the endorsements nor the contributions meant that Justice Butler was disqualified by law from participating in the case. Now let’s review Fallone’s public statements on recusal. In 2011, before his entry into the race, Fallone signed a petition to recall Gov. Scott Walker. When he decided to run, the move prompted some to say he would be precluded from hearing matters related to Walker or even state government in general. Fallone disagreed, saying that justices can engage in various forms of political activity without having to recuse themselves from a case. In a blog post, he touched on campaign contributions. "If the judge has received something of value from a party or an attorney, then they should recuse themselves because they are presumed to be in that person’s debt." He added: "However, campaign contributions received by a judge from a party or their lawyer don’t count as something of value unless the contributions are disproportionately large." So, that’s our starting position. Fallone entered the race in December 2012 and started actively campaigning in January 2013. When he did, he criticized the court and said people have "lost faith that it is independent of politics and special interests." His comments on recusal in general were cautious; Fallone warned that "there’s been a lot of gamesmanship" in trying to force justices off of cases for their political ties -- something that echoed the point Roggensack made when the rule took effect.. Roggensack points to a Fallone interview taped early in his campaign by Wisconsin Eye as evidence of a Fallone flip flop. In that January 16, 2013 interview, Wisconsin Eye senior producer Steve Walters asked Fallone to speak about the "debate over whether lawyers who contribute should force a justice off the case." Here is the exchange: Fallone: "The court has considered that issue. And the current rule is that the justices need not recuse themselves because they’ve been endorsed by a particular person or organization, or received a contribution from that organization." Walters: "Is that a fair standard? Would you change it?" Fallone: "I’m not running for the court to change those standards. Were I running for the Legislature, were I still an academic full-time, I might speak out as to my preference, but right now, I think that the court has spoken, the rules are in place. It’s something that at some point the U.S. Supreme Court has said, notwithstanding the Wisconsin rule, that at some point contributions can create a perception of bias that may implicate due process concerns..." End of comment. About three weeks later, just before the primary, Fallone directly discussed the Roggensack-supported rule at a candidate forum. Notably, that Feb. 7, 2013, appearance was the first time Fallone and Roggensack had debated. "That rule has opened the door for special interest spending on judicial elections, and it certainly creates the perception if not the reality that justice is for sale," Fallone said. "That was a rule that was supported by Justice Roggensack, and after I’m elected to the court I will work with my colleagues to amend or repeal that rule." Fallone said the rule change "allows a party in a pending case to make campaign contributions to a judge sitting on the case and prevents the opposing parties from challenging the impartiality of the judge solely on the basis of those campaign contributions." On Feb. 28, 2013, shortly after advancing past the primary, Fallone’s campaign issued a news release saying Fallone "throughout his campaign" has stated publicly he will work to overturn the rule. Turning his attention to defeating Roggensack, he dialed up the volume on his criticism and complaints about court partisanship. In a TV ad, he said Roggensack had "risked the integrity of the court." An on-screen graphic displayed the phrase, "Legalized Bribery," citing a newspaper editorial about the rule. Back on Wisconsin Eye, this time on March 19, Walters asked about the ad’s accusations and Fallone’s objections to the rule. Fallone responded: "This is the problem with campaign cash from special interest groups, flooding into our judicial races. The way to regulate it right now, as a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, the only way to get control on it is to allow it to become the basis of a recusal motion." He added: "If the party feels that the judge in their case might be biased or influenced because they’ve received campaign contributions … or independent spending on their behalf -- from the people on the other side of the case -- that party could ask the judge to step down. And that’s the way the law was, that’s the way the Supreme Court rules were, in Wisconsin. The ‘Roggensack rule’ was pushed, was a change that Justice Roggensack voted for, and defended very prominently..." Stop the tape. That’s the chronology of what happened. Let’s take stock. Did Fallone take one position in mid-January and dramatically reverse himself just a few weeks later on his way toward making a big deal out of the recusal issue in March? He said no, at the March 22, 2013, debate, and in an interview with us. His explanation: He was referring in the January Wisconsin Eye interview to the Donohoo ruling, not the Roggensack-backed rule. This gets technical. The Donohoo ruling, in the case involving Justice Butler, was a test of whether justices would decide a fellow justice should not hear a case. Fallone thinks the court was correct to decide not to force a fellow justice to step aside, so he told us he spoke favorably about the status quo in the Wisconsin Eye interview. In contrast, Fallone said he objects to the rule Roggensack voted for because it goes much further than Donohoo by making it essentially futile for lawyers even to ask judges to step down voluntarily if the issue is just a campaign donation, even a large one. Fallone said his recollection was that Walters’ question in January on Wisconsin Eye was "related to whether or not the justice … could make the determination of impartiality or whether the other justices could make that determination," he said at the March 22, 2013, forum after Roggensack accused him of flopping. However, the video shows Walters does not present the question that way. He does use the word "force," though, which Fallone says made him think about the Donohoo case. Fallone’s other recollection about the January interview was that "I did not speak to the issue of recusal based on campaign contributions by a party or lawyer in the case." The Wisconsin Eye video, though, shows that Walters did in fact ask directly about campaign contributions by lawyers. Political strategy may have played a role in how he couched his answer. Fallone was cryptic when we talked to him about it, saying: "there was one race before the primary and another one after." In January, Vince Megna, the third candidate in the primary, was running a nakedly partisan race while Fallone was trying to portray himself as above the fray. Our rating At PolitiFact, we award a Full Flop when an official makes a "major reversal of position" that is a complete flip-flop. We don’t think that fits here. Fallone sharply criticized the rule both in both the primary election and in the general election, and he went after Roggensack on it the first chance he had in a face-to-face meeting. But did he partially change his position or make inconsistent statements, which would earn him a Half Flip? A plain reading of the Wisconsin Eye interview is that Fallone didn’t express a problem at all with the Supreme Court’s take on recusals. In response to a pretty general, and pretty clear, question, he offered a sweeping endorsement of the status quo, which includes the rule backed by Roggensack. So the answer is strikingly inconsistent with his rhetoric only a few weeks later. For that, we think this merits a Half Flip.	None	Ed Fallone	None	None	None	2013-03-29T14:36:40	2013-03-22	['None']
pomt-05195	"Marcy Kaptur voted against a ban which would have prevented the aborting of a baby girl for the sole reason that she's a girl."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/12/samuel-wurzelbacher/samuel-joe-plumber-wurzelbacher-says-marcy-kaptur-/	Almost 40 years after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade legalized abortion under most circumstances, abortion remains a political hot button. Samuel "Joe the Plumber" Wurzelbacher, the Republican congressional candidate in Ohio's 9th District, demonstrates that in a news release, video and series of Twitter tweets aimed at Democratic incumbent Marcy Kaptur. "I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur has the same belief system as someone in the Chinese politburo or that she thinks it's OK to kill unborn babies. And I'm not saying that Marcy Kaptur believes in gendercide," he says in the campaign video. "But Marcy Kaptur voted against a ban which would have prevented the aborting of a baby girl for the sole reason that she's a girl." That's an emotional pitch. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. Wurzlbacher’s campaign said the vote was on H.R. 3541, the Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 2012, or "PRENDA." The bill, sponsored by Rep. Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, would have made it a federal crime with a five-year prison sentence to perform or force a woman to undergo a gender-selection abortion -- a practice that is most common in some Asian countries where families that want sons abort female fetuses. Under the bill, doctors, nurses and medical personnel who do not report suspected gender-related abortions would also face prison and a fine. The male partner and parents of the woman having the abortion would be able to sue for damages. The woman would be exempt from prosecution or civil suit. Republicans said in debate that gender-selection abortion amounts to "gendercide" and a "war on women" because it is female fetuses that are most often targeted -- rhetoric that effectively turned the tables on Democrats who previously knocked Republicans for their stances on the Violence Against Women Act and who are pushing legislation requiring equal pay for men and women. The bill's backers supported their charge of "gendercide," the Christian Science Monitor reported, by citing a study showing that an analysis of the third child born to Chinese, Indian, and Korean parents in the U.S. "strongly suggest[s]" prenatal sex selection. But a review of the legislation by the Guttmacher Institute, which promotes reproductive health and rights, argues that such practices are not widespread in the United States and that the studies to support the bill cannot prove that gender-selection abortions are a significant problem, even in particular immigrant communities. "What is conclusively known," wrote Guttmacher's Sneha Barot, "is that the U.S. sex ratio at birth in 2005 stood at 105 boys to 100 girls, squarely within biologically normal parameters." In a vote on May 31, the House bill won a majority of representatives -- 246 votes in favor and 168 against -- but failed because it was considered under a suspension of House rules. That procedure, normally used for non-controversial measures, limits debate and requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass. Franks said in a news interview before the vote that he expected the measure to fail, but that it was a strategic goal to force Democrats to vote against it. "I think we’re doing the right thing strategically," he told The Washington Post, adding that he wouldn’t be surprised if GOP candidates and conservative groups used the vote to attack Democratic opponents. Franks was correct on that point. In one subsequent statement, Wurzelbacher described Kaptur as "supporting abortions based on gender and skin color." We contacted Kaptur's campaign. Spokesman Steve Fought said the congresswoman opposed the bill because of privacy issues it raised and its potential consequences. "How do you prove someone had a gender-based abortion?" he asked, asserting that the proof would involve medical personnel knowing a woman's reason for an abortion and whether and when she knew the sex of a fetus. Knowing the gender of a fetus would involve sonograms, he said. Medical personnel fearing the possibility of prosecution could reduce the use of sonograms, against the health interest of fetuses, children and mothers -- particularly in the Asian and immigrant communities the bill targets. "It was an eminently bad piece of legislation that was introduced strictly for political posturing, under suspension of the rules and not through committee," Fought said. "The video proves that point. It was a show bill. They wanted to get people on the record voting against it so they can demagogue it." Where does that leave us? Wurzelbacher’s statement is accurate. Kaptur did vote against PRENDA. The bill would ban gender-selection abortions. But additional information is needed for clarification. Kaptur's record on abortion has been consistent. In a story about this vote, Roll Call, a Washington publication, described her as a Democrat who opposes abortion. But in this case, her staff said, concerns about other effects and consequences of the legislation played a role in her vote. And, the bill’s leading sponsor acknowledged that political strategy drove the process under which it was considered. On the Truth-O-Meter, Wurzelbacher's claim rates Mostly True.

pomt-09214	On returning Republican campaign contributions.	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/may/19/charlie-crist/gov-charlie-crist-changes-course-keeping-campaign-/	Republicans banking on hopes that Gov. Charlie Crist would return donations they made when he was the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate were in for a rude awakening on May 12, 2010, when Crist made it clear he is keeping their money. "People gave to a good cause and we're going to spend it on a good cause," Crist told reporters outside of the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections Office, after changing his registration from Republican to no party affiliation."That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be able to get our message out and communicate with the people of Florida." The decision to hold on to nearly $10 million in campaign donations prompted cries that Crist was flip-flopping -- like this statement from the Republican Party of Florida, or this video on the campaign website for Republican senate candidate Marco Rubio. While Crist may have earned a Full-Flop on our Flip-O-Meter for switching parties to bolster his Senate bid, we wondered whether Crist flip-flopped on giving refunds. Let's start with what Crist said about refunding donations before he made his independent run official on April 29, 2010. April 26, speaking to reporters in Miami. Reporter: Will you return Republican donor money, Republican Party money since you received that money as a Republican? Crist: You know, I think that's a decision that you have to make if you made a decision to go independent. I haven't made that decision yet. Crist also had this response for St. Petersburg Times political editor Adam C. Smith when asked about refunding the donations:"Anybody has the right and the opportunity to ask. I think we spent it though." Next we'll look at what he said after announcing he would leave the Republican Party. Four days later, Crist appeared before a national audience on MSNBC's Morning Joe. April 30, interview with Joe Scarborough on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Scarborough: "There are a lot of Republicans that are going to be asking you to give them the money back they gave you when you were running as a Republican, are you going to give them that money back or are you going to keep it?" Crist: "Well, No. 1, nobody's asked me yet. Not one person has asked me yet. And I think they realize that the reality is they gave it to my campaign, they gave it to me in order to espouse the ideas I believe in." Scarborough: "If they ask for money back, will you give it back to them or will you keep it for the campaign?" Crist: "Ah, probably give it back to them. It's not that big a deal. What really matters is we're able to communicate our message." So it's pretty clear in those comments that Crist favors returning the donations. But before we make our Flip-O-Meter ruling, here's what Crist said about two weeks later: May 12, speaking to reporters outside of the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections office when registering as no party affiliation. "People gave to a good cause and we're going to spend it on a good cause," Crist told reporters. "That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be able to get our message out and communicate with the people of Florida." The same day, Crist campaign spokeswoman Michelle Todd made it clear to reporters that the money was non-refundable at this point. "We have never made an official statement before," Todd said, in an interview with Miami Herald political reporter Beth Reinhard. "It is now the official statement. They donated to the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign and it's still the Charlie Crist for U.S. Senate campaign." Crist explained his decision a day later in a meeting with the St. Petersburg Times editorial board. He was asked if there would have been any downside to returning the money: "Probably wouldn't be. ... I want it. I need it. I want to win." And one last note, as he opened his campaign headquarters in St. Petersburg on May 15, Crist was heckled by someone in the crowd who asked, "What about the guys who gave you money when you were a Republican?!" "I'm going to keep it!" Crist cheerfully responded, drawing roars of approval. (Watch the St. Petersburg Times' video here and check out his wink around 3:10 into the clip.) We should point out that Crist has returned some campaign donations, according to reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission, but for a different reason. He returned $76,250 in donations from the Fort Lauderdale law firm of Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein to a bankruptcy trustee, and another $9,600 from Rothstein and his wife to the U.S. Marshall's office. Also, Republican donor Al Hoffman got his $4,800 returned in February because of allegations of excessive spending by the Republican Party of Florida and Crist's hand-picked chairman Jim Greer. So in less than three weeks, Crist went from telling reporters he had yet to make a decision on running for indepedent, to running as an independent and "probably" giving the money back, to "officially" declaring he would keep the money. Our main issue is Crist's use of the word "probably" during his Morning Joe interview. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines probably as "insofar as seems reasonably true, factual, or to be expected: without much doubt." Crist said he would "probably give it back to them," leading donors to believe that as the dictionary states it was "to be expected" or "without much doubt" that they would see some of their cash back from Crist. We find Crist completely changed his position from entertaining the idea of giving the money back, to definitely not giving the money back. Our verdict: Full Flop.

pomt-01664	Says Keene, N.H., requested a "military-grade armored personnel truck," citing their annual Pumpkin Festival as "a possible target" for terrorists.	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/aug/20/john-oliver/right-there-application/	With protests continuing in Ferguson, Mo., following the shooting of an unarmed teenager, police have rolled out an arsenal of weapons, vehicles and riot gear to help quell any unrest in the St. Louis suburb. While local officials say they’re trying to maintain safety and protect property, the sight of police officers in combat gear has sparked a national conversation about whether the police need to be outfitted with military-grade equipment. HBO television host John Oliver took aim at the militarization of civilian police forces in his Sunday night show, Last Week Tonight, that aired August 17. Oliver said federal funding for anti-terrorism efforts has been doled out on such a massive scale that even Keene -- with fewer than 30,000 residents -- secured a military-grade truck for its police department. "This has happened on such a scale that it’s enabled small towns like Keene, N.H., to apply for a BearCat, a military-grade armored personnel truck, which they needed because, as their application argued, ‘the terrorism threat is far-reaching and often unforeseen,’ and cited as a possible target their annual Pumpkin Festival." He mused that the armored vehicle would be an effective deterrent for pumpkin smashers. "Good luck easily out-maneuvering that, teenagers with baseball bats!" he said. We wondered whether Oliver was playing straight with the facts, even as he played the episode for laughs. Did the Keene Police Department really cite a terrorism threat at the Pumpkin Festival when it asked for federal money? We checked with Oliver’s staff, but they’re on a two-week break and unable to respond. First, some background on the Pumpkin Festival. It’s held each year in October and draws as many as 70,000 people to downtown Keene. It is best known for the city’s ongoing attempts to set the world record for the most lit jack-o’-lanterns in one place. So what does an iconic New England fall festival have to do with armored vehicles and terrorism? Keene’s city council accepted a federal grant in 2012 to purchase the armored personnel carrier, named a "BearCat" by its manufacturer. At the time, a city councilor called the $285,933 vehicle a "poster child of waste." The BearCat hit the streets on Nov. 20, 2012, after a contentious debate among Keene residents about its necessity. Funding came from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through a grant managed by the New Hampshire Department of Safety. During public meetings leading up to the purchase, it appears there was little conversation about the threat of terrorism in southern New Hampshire. The discussion centered mainly around how the vehicle would be deployed during routine law enforcement procedures, such as evacuating residents during a flood or policing the campus of Keene State College. "The original reason for filing the grant application was to acquire the piece of equipment in case there was some kind of crisis -- some kind of emergency that required the use of that type of equipment," said Keene Mayor Kendall Lane, who was serving on the city council at the time. He said in his recollection, the BearCat has been deployed only twice since it was acquired. In both instances, police were dealing with potentially armed subjects. Lane said Keene didn't cite the Pumpkin Fest as the only reason to get the BearCat, and for that reason, he believes Oliver’s bit was a little misleading. "It was humorous, but you know, the implication was that the Pumpkin Fest attracts a few hundred people in a rural part of America that would never be subject to a terrorist act. It was humorous. It was funny, but it was miscast." By our reading, though, Oliver is correct that the Keene Police Department’s written application for federal funds focused mainly on terrorism -- aligning with the aims of the Department of Homeland Security. Keene’s Pumpkin Festival is among several annual events that draw large crowds and are "susceptible to terrorist attacks," the application states. Keene Police Chief Kenneth Meola also mentioned the threat of terrorism during a meeting with Keene State College students in February 2012. "Do I think al-Qaeda is going to target Pumpkin Fest? No, but are there fringe groups that want to make a statement? Yes, and we should prepare for that," he said. "It is a target in the New Hampshire region." Jim Massery, government sales manager for the Massachusetts company that manufactures the vehicles, also alluded to the threat of terrorism during an interview with Huffington Post. "We don’t know what the terrorists are thinking," said Massery, of Lenco Armored Vehicles. "No one predicted that terrorists would take over airplanes on Sept. 11. If a group of terrorists decide to shoot up a shopping mall in a town like Keene, wouldn't you rather be prepared?" While the Department of Homeland Security perceived a significant enough threat in Keene to authorize funds for the BearCat, Oliver isn’t the only commentator who has second-guessed the decision. U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a member of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, detailed Keene's vehicle purchase in his 2012 report on misguided and wasteful spending in terror-prevention grant programs. The American Civil Liberties Union also devoted a section of its comprehensive June 2014 report on the militarization of American police departments to Keene’s BearCat. "Not even Keene city officials believed that the city actually needed the BearCat to thwart terrorism," the ACLU report reads. "To explain why the police included the word ‘terrorism’ on their application for federal funding for this purchase, a city council member said, ‘Our application talked about the danger of domestic terrorism, but that’s just something you put in the grant application to get the money. What red-blooded American cop isn’t going to be excited about getting a toy like this? That’s what it comes down to.’" Our ruling Oliver said the Keene Police Department cited its annual Pumpkin Festival as a potential target for terrorism when it applied for grant money to buy an armored personnel truck. Keene’s mayor says the city had a variety of reasons for seeking the BearCat, but Oliver was correct to state that the city cited the Pumpkin Festival as a possible target for terrorists. We rate Oliver’s claim True.	None	John Oliver	None	None	None	2014-08-20T11:21:17	2014-08-17	['None']
pomt-04488	"In one year, (President Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world … into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-provided-90-billion/	In the battle of big numbers at the first presidential debate, Mitt Romney used one five times to attack President Barack Obama’s energy policy: $90 billion. That was the price tag of "breaks to the green energy world" Obama provided "in one year," Romney said. Later, he elaborated the president had put that money "into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1." So, tens of billions funneled from the Obama administration to troubled companies for alternative energy — in one year. Really? We asked the Romney campaign about that $90 billion. Five times The number appears in a 2010 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the American Recovery And Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill. According to the report, $90 billion is the amount of money in the Obama law for "clean energy investments." Here’s how Romney used the number in the debate. Obama had attacked $4 billion a year in "corporate welfare" for the oil industry. (His proposed 2013 budget called for removing a handful of "tax provisions that preferentially benefit fossil fuel production." PolitiFact Ohio reported that the nonpartisan taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense estimates the U.S. tax code currently contains about $5 billion in yearly tax breaks that are exclusive to the oil and gas industry.) Romney fired back: First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. … And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth. So, Romney contrasted a "tax break" of a few billion for oil companies with "breaks" worth tens of billions for "green energy." Later in the debate, he got more specific: But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure. Finally, Romney drove home the number, repeating it three more times, and linking it to companies who have "gone out of business." You put $90 billion into green jobs. And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. It’s fair to say that listeners may have gotten the impression that Obama gave $90 billion in tax breaks in a single year to companies for alternative energy like solar and wind, many of which didn’t fare well. ‘One year’ of ‘breaks’ Back to that report about stimulus spending on clean energy. Were there $90 billion in "breaks"? Perhaps in a generic sense, as in — some folks caught a break by taking advantage of government spending. But not so much if Romney meant "tax breaks" like those for oil and gas. Rather, the money was distributed in six different ways: private and public matching grants, tax credits, loan guarantees, direct loans and interest subsidies. Tax benefits were part of the package, but so were very different kinds of spending. "The vast majority of the $90 billion for green energy weren't tax breaks," said Michael Grabell, a reporter for Pulitzer-winning site ProPublica who published a book this year on stimulus spending, Money Well Spent? Meanwhile, the money would have been distributed over longer than one year, depending on the program. Some money — such as for high-speed rail — states still have a few years to spend, Grabell said. Weatherization projects, among the quicker programs, took two or three years. The loan guarantee program through the Department of Energy, which benefitted troubled solar panel maker Solyndra, focused on projects through September 2011. So, Romney is off in two respects. They are not just tax breaks and they are not just for one year. ‘Solar and wind ... Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1’ We’ll assume Romney meant "solar and wind" and "Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1," as merely examples of Obama’s $90 billion in green energy spending in the stimulus. But even as examples, they’re problematic. "Solar and wind" investments represented comparatively small parts of the $90 billion. Solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra and electric-battery maker Ener1, which got stimulus-backed help, qualified for less than $700 million in grants and loan guarantees, and didn’t use it all. Fisker and Tesla — troubled electric-car companies that got loan guarantees funded with money appropriated under President George W.Bush — had nothing at all to do with the $90 billion. So, just what did make up the $90 billion? The Council of Economic Advisers report cited by the Romney campaign breaks the spending into eight categories. Here’s the majority of it: • About a third of the money, $29 billion, was for energy efficiency, such as "$5 billion to pay for energy efficiency retrofits in low-income homes." States and local governments directed a lot of the money. Grabell’s book on the stimulus says about 600,000 low-income homes were made more energy efficient — with, say, new furnaces, thermostats, windows, insulation or repairs. • About 20 percent of the money, $18 billion, was for traditional transit and high-speed rail. The money went to more than 30 states for infrastructure projects. • More than 10 percent of it, $10 billion, was marked for modernization of the electrical grid. Utilities used the money to install digital meters to track energy usage in real time, and for things like sensors and substation devices, Grabell reported. That’s more than 60 percent of the $90 billion Romney’s campaign said he was talking about. Much of it funneled through state and local governments to contractors for specific projects, rather than as breaks directly for companies. Less than 40 percent of the $90 billion included was for things such as the installation of wind turbines and solar panels, supporting American manufacturing of advanced batteries and other advanced vehicle technology, research and development of clean coal technology and a few billion in tax credits for alternative energy. Those investments are more in line with Romney’s characterization. But they represent less than half the "$90 billion" he repeatedly mentioned. Why does it matter if Romney mischaracterized how the money was used, as long as it went to clean energy? He draws a conclusion about winners and losers, and says, "and these businesses, many of them have gone out of business." It’s a claim that our colleagues at FactCheck.org addressed this week, pointing out that might be true of companies that got loan guarantees in a single year — a sliver of a sliver of the money that Romney’s talking about. But less than 12 percent of the 26 companies that ultimately benefited from the program filed for bankruptcy, FactCheck.org reported. And the entire loan guarantee program represented just a few billion of the $90 billion investment outlined by the Council of Economic Advisors. "A very small percentage of all the companies that benefited from the $90 billion in green job spending have gone out of business," said Grabell, the author of Money Well Spent? "Not half of them. Not even half of the loan guarantees. " Our ruling Romney used the number "$90 billion" five times in the first presidential debate, claiming, "In one year, (Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world … into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1." That is incorrect in several ways. That $90 billion, as described in a report provided by the Romney campaign, wasn’t provided in one year, wasn’t distributed primarily via tax breaks, wasn’t primarily provided directly to companies, wasn’t primarily spent on solar and wind, and wasn’t spent at all on Fisker or Tesla. In reality, more than 60 percent of it was directed to state and local governments and utility companies for energy efficiency, transportation and electrical infrastructure . We rate his claim False.

pomt-12220	"Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough: ‘The next step is single payer.' Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jul/19/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republicans-mislead-ad-linking-bill-nelson-elizabe/	Republicans are attempting to link U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party that has pushed for single-payer health care. A Facebook ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee ties Nelson, D-Fla., to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. "Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough," states the Facebook ad, which started July 5. Then it quotes Warren saying "the next step is single payer." The text on the screen continues: "Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time. Tell Sen. Nelson no to government health care!" Republicans are targeting Nelson because he faces re-election in 2018 in a state won by President Donald Trump and he is likely to face Republican Gov. Rick Scott, a key advocate of repealing the Affordable Care Act. In June, Warren told the Wall Street Journal that Democrats should run on single payer in 2018. It’s possible to view the ad and get the impression that Nelson has supported single payer, a system in which government would provide health care coverage for everyone similar to Canada. A spokeswoman for the NRSC disagreed with that interpretation. She said that the line is a reference to Nelson agreeing with Warren on a majority of votes. The NRSC’s press release announcing the ad raises the question if Nelson will "support Warren’s socialized health care plan." "It’s a fair question, seeing Warren is advocating for Democrats up in 2018 to run on single payer," Katie Martin, NRSC spokeswoman, told PolitiFact. We’ll examine the ad’s entire text and issue an overall rating. Nelson said little about single payer Nelson has scarcely mentioned "single payer" at all in the years leading up to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or even since that time. At an October 2005 speech to the Tiger Bay Club of St. Petersburg, the Tampa Tribune paraphrased Nelson’s answer to a question about health care. The Tribune wrote that Nelson said he opposed a universal, single-payer health care program, but that employers should not be the main source of health insurance for individuals. Large groups of consumers organized into purchasing units should replace employers as group insurance purchasers, he said. Some Democrats pushed for a single-payer system leading up to the passage of the Affordable Care Act. (There was a time when Barack Obama supported it, too.) But there wasn’t enough support for that route. In the summer of 2009, Nelson said little about the pending legislation, drawing heat from some Democratic activists. By the fall, he sounded cautiously supportive and called the bill a "starting point." Nelson actually pushed back against those who said the health proposal would end up turning into single payer. For example, during a Senate Committee on Finance markup of the bill on Sept. 29, 2009, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, argued that "the government plan will eventually lead us to a de facto single-payer system of health care." Nelson disagreed with Grassley’s conclusion. "Now you just made a statement that it will lead to a single payer. How in the world do you make that leap?" Nelson said. Nelson’s office declined to comment for this fact-check; however, on the day the NRSC ad appeared, Nelson addressed the question of his view on single payer while meeting with college students in Orlando. "When people say, ‘Are you for single payer,’ I’m having enough trouble right now just keeping the ACA," Nelson said. "America is not ready for single payer, but America is ready — and has — the ACA. People are trying to take that away and take health care away from 22 million people." Nelson has said he would not vote for the Republican’s Senate health care plan and has called for bipartisan fixes. The legislation has failed to garner sufficient Republican support to proceed. Comparing voting records The NRSC sent us a screengrab of CQ data showing a comparison of Warren’s voting record with Nelson’s record between January 2013 and June 27, 2017. The data shows that Nelson and Warren voted the same way on 1,126 votes out of 1,250, or 90 percent. The fact that members of the same party agree with each other on issues that reach a vote isn’t a surprise in an increasingly partisan atmosphere. However, the issues that reach a vote don’t tell the full story about a senator’s beliefs, University of Miami political science professor Gregory Koger said. "The Senate votes on a carefully selected sort of issues, biased toward extremely conservative ideas (to mollify Ted Cruz types), consensus proposals, or middle-of-the-road Democratic proposals," Koger said. "Indeed, one of the reasons the Senate has been dysfunctional is that both parties fight hard to keep many issues from coming to a roll call vote." Voting together on a carefully screened set of issues does not imply agreement on controversial proposals. Our ruling The NRSC said, "Elizabeth Warren doesn't think Obamacare goes far enough: 'The next step is single payer.' Does Sen. Nelson agree? He has in the past ... Sen. Nelson votes with Warren 90 percent of the time." The ad suggests that Nelson supports Warren on most things, including a single-payer health care system. Actually, Nelson has said he doesn’t support single payer and wants to focus on preserving current law. His voting record is similar to Warren’s, but members of the same party increasingly vote alike due to a lack of bipartisan votes in the Senate. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-04651	"This would be the largest casino in the United States."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/11/its-still-bad-idea/would-proposed-casino-wood-village-be-countrys-lar/	One of the priciest state measure campaigns this fall will be over a proposed private casino in Wood Village in population-rich Multnomah County.Supporters of the state’s first non-tribal casino say it would provide money for schools as well a nearby entertainment center for the family. A similar idea failed with voters two years ago. A coalition of critics calling itself the It's Still a Bad Idea committee called an inaugural press event on Monday to denounce what it calls a "slick campaign" by casino advocates to "mislead voters," according to a press release. The campaign is funded largely by Oregon tribes, which operate their own casinos and could lose money to the private venture. At the event, campaign spokeswoman Cynara Lilly told reporters that The Grange, as it’s called, "would be the largest casino in the United States." Really? In little old Wood Village? That didn’t sound right. Maybe it would be the largest in Oregon, but we knew enough about mega-casinos to know that sounded overblown. First, we checked with Lilly, to make sure we had quoted her correctly. We had, but she wanted to make a clarification. "I did mis-speak," she said to PolitiFact Oregon. "Technically, this would not be the largest casino in the United States. It would be the second largest. It would be the largest in the West." She specified not square footage, but the number of slot machines and gambling tables. That still sounded on the high side. The Grange proposes a 130,000 square-foot casino with 2,200 slot machines and 100 gambling tables. That would top the number of video slot machines at Oregon’s largest tribal casino -- the Grand Ronde’s Spirit Mountain Casino-- but 2,200 is pretty much the norm for the big players in Las Vegas. So what gives? And here’s where we get to the fine print. The Grange developers have a business plan for a casino with 2,200 slot machines and 100 card tables, but the language in Measure 83 would allow for up to 3,500 slot machines and 150 gaming tables. (Anna Richter Taylor, a spokeswoman for Grange developers, said they will build the proposed amount as that’s what the market will bear and they don’t anticipate that changing.) A 3,500-machine casino would be larger than the posh Bellagio in Las Vegas, which has more than 100,000 square feet with 2,400 slot machines. Or Mandalay Bay in Vegas, which has more than 2,000 slot machines. But it would pale next to the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, which has 6,000 slot machines, and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Tampa, Fla., which "features more than 5,000 slot machines, 110 table games and 50 poker tables." The WinStar World Casino in Oklahoma has 500,000 square feet of "gaming floor" with about 6,700 electronic games and 76 tables. You get the point. Many of these mega-casinos are in the midwest and in the east, so Lilly is on the rightish track when she tells PolitiFact Oregon that a Wood Village casino with 3,500 slot machines would be the largest casino on the West Coast. Certainly it would contain more than twice the floor size of Spirit Mountain Casino. Here’s the problem with that: (1) That’s not what she said at the press event, which was called to counter what they call a deceptive campaign waged by casino advocates, and (2) Grange developers aren’t building a casino with 3,500 video poker machines and 150 card tables. We know! Some of you are probably thinking, how could PolitiFact Oregon be so naive? How could we be so gullible? What’s to stop the private casino people from pitching a smaller casino, then building a larger one? Well, all we can say is that developers would still have to get local permits to build a casino with more slot machines and, according to one legal reading, legislators can change the statutory maximum. In any case, casino opponents are right to call out the larger numbers in the measure. Voters should have that information. But we can’t measure a proposed casino on the maximum number allowed when backers are selling a smaller number. PolitiFact Florida had the same issue in 2011 and fact checkers there went with the developer’s stated number when assessing a claim about a proposed 800,000 square-foot casino in Miami. We follow precedent and go with what the developers say, and we return to the statement. Campaigns bear a special responsibility when making statements for or against anything. They have to have their facts straight, and they have to know what they’re talking about. We understand that people sometimes slip, but campaign people can’t afford to do that. Especially when they have called a press conference to counter deceptive campaigning by the other side. Lilly said that the proposed casino in Wood Village would be the largest in the country, which is not only inaccurate, but downright ridiculous. Her revised statement that the proposed casino would be the second largest in the country isn’t even close to accurate either. That shows a reckless disregard for accuracy.

pomt-14994	President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry agreed "to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct."	false	/georgia/statements/2015/oct/13/lynn-westmoreland/Westmoreland-ran-doesnt-have-to-prove-nuclear-plan/	Georgia Congressman Lynn Westmoreland stood with the majority in the U.S. House last month in refusing to approve the nuclear pact that President Barack Obama signed with Iran in Vienna on July 14. In a Sept. 11 press release, Westmoreland, a Republican, said the United States didn’t need to negotiate with "dangerous" and untrustworthy Iran and said the deal "only weakens the national security of our country" and its allies, particularly Israel. "Like many times before, President Obama is manipulating the system to get his way: presenting this to the American people as a ‘deal’ instead of what it really is – a treaty to circumvent needing approval by Congress," Westmoreland said. "President Obama and Secretary (John) Kerry also showed a lack of leadership and strength in agreeing to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct." Politifact has fact-checked several claims about the pact, which is an executive agreement, not a treaty subject to congressional approval. For example, we rated False a statement from Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz that said the deal "trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves." This time, a reader from Westmoreland’s congressional district asked Politifact Georgia to truth-test the statement that Obama and Kerry had agreed "to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct." "My understanding is that Iran must meet certain requirements through verification before these sanctions are lifted," the reader wrote. "Can you please investigate this claim?" The historic agreement was reached in July between Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States and was backed by 41 Senate Democrats. It calls for Iran to significantly limit its nuclear capabilities for more than a decade in exchange for being relieved of economically crippling international sanctions. (Executive agreements, such as this, do not require congressional approval. But many in Congress were upset at this and insisted that the House and Senate have weigh-in. Earlier this year, a law was passed mandating a vote on a resolution of disapproval. Had it passed by two-thirds, it could have blocked the [resident’s legal authority to waive sanctions on Iran in exchange for actions to curb Iran’s nuclear capabilities.But the resolution did not receive the necessary 60-vote majority that is necessary in the Senate to be formally considered; in the House, there were not enough votes in favor of disapproval to overcome a presidential veto. Therefore, the resolution of disapproval failed in both Houses and the deal is going forward.) Opponents say the deal lacks long-term assurances that Iran -- hostile to Israel and the U.S. and one of three countries still identified by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism -- won’t develop nukes. They say the U.S. should demand that Iran renounce any future nuclear arms ambitions and any involvement in terrorism in exchange for having the sanctions lifted. Supporters say the accord, while far from perfect, has safeguards to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons in the short term. They say the U.S. had to make concessions because many of its allies had grown weary of continuing economic sanctions against oil-rich Iran. Initially, we weren’t entirely certain what Westmoreland meant by "conduct." Was it the country’s nuclear policy? Foreign policies? Human rights record? We zeroed in on the nuclear threat after Leigh Claffey, the communications director for Westmoreland, responded when we told her a reader had asked us to fact-check the accuracy of the statement. Claffey said Westmoreland’s statement was based, in part, on the fact that the U.S. does not have any inspectors on the ground to receive firsthand knowledge or confirmation that the Iranians have changed their ways. The U.S. also is not part of the inspection process, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations entity entrusted with monitoring nuclear nonproliferation commitments, is not permitted access to all Iranian sites, she said. Claffey also forwarded us links to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s "21 reasons the Iran deal is a bad deal" and to an opinion piece in The New York Times calling it "the worst agreement in U.S. Diplomatic history." Additionally, she cited a statement from the conservative Foundation for Defense of Democracy that read, in part, that "the fatal flaw" of the pact is its sunset clauses, which permit "critical nuclear, arms, and ballistic missile restrictions to disappear over a five- to 15-year period." Long list of requirements Greg Terryn, a research and policy associate with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington, said Westmoreland "is mistaken." "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the pact) specifically delays the lifting of any sanctions until the IAEA has verified that Iran is living up to its commitments under the agreement," Terryn said. In the language of the deal, this is described as Adoption Day -- the day Iran must begin working toward its commitments under the agreement, Terryn said. Implementation Day is the day the U.S., United Nations and European Union must waive the implementation of certain sanctions, he said. "Implementation Day only comes about when the IAEA verifies that Iran has fulfilled its initial obligations under the agreement," Terryn said. The agreement lists 82 specific items about its nuclear program that Iran has to change to satisfy the international community. These include reducing the country’s stockpile of enriched uranium down to 300 kg and removing the core of the reactor at Arak and filling it with concrete. Ultimately, the deal rolls back Iran’s nuclear program for more than a decade, pushing back the time it would take Iran to enrich enough nuclear material for one nuclear weapon from a few months to at least one year, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. We contacted several other nuclear-policy experts, only one of whom thought Westmoreland’s statement had merit. "The problem is there are tiers of sanctions -- the United Nations sanctions, the United States sanctions -- and the sanctions are being lifted upfront without Iran having to change its conduct, without Iran having to abide by the agreement itself," said Michaela Dodge, a senior policy analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Technically, the way the agreement is written, they do not have to change their conduct." Daryl Kimball, executive director of the nonprofit Arms Control Association in Washington D.C., said the pact "definitely requires Iran to effect radical changes in the conduct and capacity of Iran’s nuclear program before there is any sanctions relief." "There will be no sanctions relief — whatsoever — before ‘Implementation Day,’ and to get to that point Iran must take very substantial steps and put in place tough restrictions that will block its ability to produce nuclear bomb material, allow much more intrusive inspections, and answer questions from the IAEA about past experiments with ‘possible military dimensions,’ " Kimball said. Shawn l. Ramirez, an assistant professor of political science at Emory University, said "numerous ‘proofs’ of compliance with the terms of the agreement are required of Iran over time to actually lift the sanctions." "In fact," Ramirez said, "restoring the sanctions cannot be undone unless all five members of the UN Security Council agree to continue to suspend sanctions — the U.S. has locked in its veto power to punish Iran if Iran doesn’t comply." Our ruling U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland said that President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry agreed to lift Iran’s economic and arms sanctions without any proof of change in conduct. The Iran deal may be less than perfect. And there’s certainly reason to be dubious of Iran, one of only three nations that remain on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. But most experts say the agreement does require Iran to make significant changes before some, if not all, sanctions are removed and pushes back the timeframe on Iran’s ability to make a bomb. We rate Westmoreland’s statement False.	None	Lynn Westmoreland	None	None	None	2015-10-13T00:00:00	2015-09-11	['Barack_Obama', 'Iran', 'John_Kerry']
pomt-01707	Says GOP primary opponents Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a "compromise vote that cost $788 million" in higher electricity costs.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/10/duey-stroebel/stroebel-says-compromise-vote-opponents-cost-788-m/	Republicans running for Congress in east-central Wisconsin are competing for the title of most uncompromising conservative. Take candidate Duey Stroebel’s attack on fellow state lawmakers Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham in the hotly contested Aug. 12. 2014 GOP primary. The online ad features Grothman explaining, during a candidate forum, a vote he cast in the state Senate that required utilities to sell more electricity generated from wind and other technologies. "There was a bad mandate in the state of Wisconsin," Grothman says in the clip. "Sometimes when you’re in Madison you’re stuck with taking a compromise vote." A snarky-sounding narrator jumps in: "Compromise? A compromise vote that cost $788 million? If career politicians Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham are willing to compromise on conservative principles in Madison, what would they compromise on in Washington?" Did Grothman and Leibham, both state senators, support a change that cost consumers $788 million? In 2006, both voted for a bill requiring electric providers to increase the amount of renewable electricity they sell by two percentage points above their current level by 2010, and by six percentage points above their current level by 2015. The legislation established a statewide goal that 10 percent of all electricity sales in Wisconsin be from renewable resources by 2015. That goal was met in 2013, two years early, the state Public Service Commission announced. (Legislative records show that in 1998 Grothman voted for the original mandate, which set a 2.2 percent goal. Leibham was not yet in the Legislature. Stroebel, a state representative, was elected in 2011.) So, no doubt about their votes. Was the 2006 vote a compromise? The vote on the measure came at a time when Republicans controlled the Legislature, but Democrat Jim Doyle was in the governor’s chair. A Republican sponsor, state Sen. Robert Cowles of Green Bay, credited passage to compromises made by utilities and manufacturers to customer and environmental groups. A combination of high energy prices, the improvement of wind- and solar-power technologies and political will helped, he said at the time, according to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories. Grothman says the vote prevented a mandate that would have been set at higher than 10 percent, but Renew Wisconsin policy director Michael Vickerman recalls that no higher number was on the table. The measure passed 32-1 in the state Senate (and unanimously in the Assembly). State Sen. Tom Reynolds, R- West Allis, cast the lone no vote, saying the legislation would drive up energy bills. Cowles countered it would lead to $2 billion in investments from energy companies that would drive down the cost of producing renewable energy. In 2012, Grothman appeared to sour on the mandate, saying he wanted to freeze it at 2012 levels because windmills had become controversial among residents in his district. What about the price tag? To back up the $788 million figure, the Stroebel ad cites a March 2013 study released by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative-oriented think tank. With some Democrats proposing a 25 percent requirement, WPRI said it was timely to study what it calls the "often forgotten" costs of using more renewable energy. To do the research, WPRI turned to The Beacon Hill Institute, a Boston-based research group interested in limited government. It tangled with environmental groups in Wisconsin in 2009 after criticizing the cost of efforts to fight climate change. The Beacon study did not tally the actual cost to that point to consumers of the renewable mandate. Instead, it used forecasting techniques and various assumptions to predict what the mandate would cost in the four years from 2013 to 2016. The conclusion: $788 million. Paul Bachman, Beacon Hill’s research director and co-author of the study, told PolitiFact Wisconsin the number could be smaller than $788 million because after the study was completed, the state announced that utilities had reached the 10 percent goal earlier than expected. The Beacon study had assumed renewable energy sales would continue to increase as the 2015 deadline approached. The state Public Service Commission in 2014 commented on the impact of that 10 percent goal being met early. "A solid argument could be made that any additional renewable energy added to electric provider portfolios past 2013 will not be driven by (the state mandate)," the agency said. The impact of the mandate should level off or perhaps even decrease at some point, the PSC said. So the $788 million, just a projection to begin with, may well turn out to be high. But that and other numbers in the study appear to be in the ballpark, at least, based on the state Public Service Commission’s studies of actual costs that have been incurred so far. Actual costs studied The PSC’s own studies look backward in time at the costs of the renewables mandate. The cost of the mandate was $532 million over the five years from 2008 through 2012, the agency has calculated, said Andrew Kell, an analyst in the PSC’s division of regional energy markets. In 2012 alone it was about $184 million. One last issue. The ad’s shorthand phrasing -- "compromise vote that cost $788 million" -- could suggest that the legislation already has cost $788 million. But even if we consider just the actual costs so far, the $788 million figure might be on target. Why? Because the mandate’s been in place since 1998 -- 15 years. Considering that the $532 million figure covers just 5 years, it’s reasonable to assume the 15-year total is higher. Our rating Stroebel’s ad says Glenn Grothman and Joe Leibham cast a "compromise vote that cost $788 million" in higher electricity costs. They cast that vote, and higher costs have followed. The claim needs some clarification, though, because of the many factors involved in determining the actual cost and whether the claim, as stated, referred to past or future costs. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Duey Stroebel	None	None	None	2014-08-10T05:00:00	2014-07-30	['None']
pomt-03057	The shutdown is projected to result in "$10 billion in costs to the economy per week."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/oct/03/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-federal-shutdown-10-/	Now that we’re living in a federal government shutdown, what’s the hit to the economy? U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz wagged her calculator at the GOP and cited a whopping figure on Twitter. "$10 billion in costs to the economy per week and this is what the R's had to say?" tweeted Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, who also serves as the chair of the Democratic National Committee. We wanted to check her number: How much will the shutdown cost the economy? Predictions about economic shutdown Wasserman Schultz’s numbers are the same as those from the White House. A White House spokesman said the $10 billion figure came from an August report from the investment group Goldman Sachs. We also found similar estimates from Moody’s and IHS. These financial firms agree that the impact depends on how long the shutdown goes on. The impact gets worse the longer a closure lasts. "A brief shutdown would delay, not cancel, most spending," said the Goldman Sachs report. "In a brief shutdown, it is likely that only federal employee compensation would be lost — most of the other activity would just be delayed and made up later. A longer shutdown ― the longest shutdown on record in late 1995 and early 1996 lasted about three weeks — would affect a greater share of federal activities." The report includes three scenarios based on a two-day, one-week and three-week shutdown. It predicts a $2.6 billion economic loss for a two-day shutdown, $10.4 billion for a week and $36.8 billion for three weeks. Moody’s found that a shutdown lasting three to four weeks would cost $55 billion, with costs accelerating as time goes on. Moody’s takes into account the losses from federal workers not getting paid, the delay of housing and small business loans, the hit to tourism spending and the interruptions for contractors. "To be clear, these are rough estimates of what we think impacts will be," Moody’s analyst Brian Kessler told PolitiFact. "There is just a ridiculously large number of moving parts." Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, testified before the Joint Economic Committee about the shutdown in September. "A shutdown that lasts only three or four days would have modest economic consequences, costing the economy approximately 0.2 percentage point of annualized real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. ... However, shutting the government down for three or four weeks would do significant economic damage, reducing real GDP by 1.4 percentage points in the fourth quarter. And this likely understates the economic fallout, as it does not fully account for the impact of such a lengthy shutdown on consumer, business and investor psychology." IHS calculated a loss of $1.6 billion for one week as a result of furloughs, with the impact increasing for a longer shutdown. "The spending habits of government employees probably would not change if the shutdown was short-lived, particularly if they believed that they would receive back wages, as in 1995," states the September IHS report. "Any uncertainty about compensation, however, could increase the impact on consumer spending. Meanwhile, incomes would be maintained for Social Security beneficiaries. Medicare payments would also continue, so spending on health care services would not be harmed and hospitals and doctors would receive payments." Other experts weighing in on the estimates We also read studies about previous shutdowns and media reports analyzing the potential hit to the economy. We interviewed Tad DeHaven, budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute; Jason Peuquet, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic Policy Research. Our experts generally agreed on one key point: The economic hit will depend on how long the shutdown lasts. Jason Peuquet of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us that it "extremely difficult to quantify" the impact on the economy of a shutdown. "Sure, analysts can calculate the direct costs of furloughing federal employees," Peuquet told PolitiFact in an email. "But once you factor in the impacts on thousands of federal contractors, the time and resources lost preparing for and implementing the shutdown, the added economic uncertainty of how lawmakers will resolve this, how the Federal Reserve may respond if the shutdown continues for an extended period, and then the ensuing economic reverberations of these changes, it is a very imprecise exercise." DeHaven of Cato emphasized that these analyses from economists are just estimates and that the actual impact on the economy could be different. "If you go back and look at previous shutdowns, there was no long-term effect...," DeHaven said. "For Wasserman Schultz or the White House to tweet out this going to cost X amount of money to me is nonsense. You could talk about the cost associated due to government creating uncertainty in the economy for a lot of things Washington is doing." The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded that the cost of shutdowns in fiscal year 1996 was $1.4 billion -- most of that was for back pay to furloughed workers, according to University of Maryland political science professor Roy Meyers. In 1995, the government first closed from Nov. 14-19 and then again from Dec. 16-Jan.6. But Peuquet and Meyers told us that there are some factors that could make the shutdown economic hit different today, which means we can’t simply add an inflation factor to the mid 1990s shutdowns. Back then, several appropriations bills had already been enacted -- allowing spending in several areas of the federal government. This time, those bills haven’t been enacted. The federal government also relies more heavily on contractors than it did in the 1990s, and they are unlikely to get back pay. "We are still learning a lot of this as we go," Peuquet said. Another factor to consider: The economy is much worse now than it was in the mid 1990s. "This one is going to be bigger in terms of daily costs...," Meyers told PolitiFact. "The economy is weaker. It can’t handle as much of a shock as it could handle in ‘95-’96." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said the shutdown is projected to result in "$10 billion in costs to the economy per week." That number comes from an investment report from Goldman Sachs. We found other estimates from financial firms that were slightly larger and slightly smaller than the $10 billion figure, but they were in the same ballpark. A key point here, though, is that these are estimates. Experts agree that caution and caveats are needed: There is much uncertainty about the economic impact, including the timing and length of the shutdown. For instance, if the shutdown is short and workers get paid back wages, the impact could ultimately be modest. If the shutdown continues for several weeks, the price tag could escalate exponentially. Overall, we rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2013-10-03T17:43:37	2013-10-01	['None']
pomt-12043	The new Illinois school funding formula "created a tax shelter for the wealthy and a voucher program…"	half-true	/illinois/statements/2017/sep/12/karen-lewis/call-it-what-you-want-karen-lewis-calls-illinois-s/	For many public education advocates in Illinois, Aug. 31 was a historic day. When Gov. Bruce Rauner put his signature on Senate Bill 1947, he set in motion a plan designed to end Illinois’ status as home to the most unfair school funding system in the nation. But for the Chicago Teachers Union, the good news was tempered by the inclusion in the new plan of the Invest in Kids Act -- a five-year pilot program that will allow up to $75 million in tax credits per year for donors to scholarship funds for private elementary and high schools. This, the union says, amounts to an Illinois prototype for public funding of a private school voucher system like those in 14 states and the District of Columbia. "Unfortunately, Illinois legislators have voted to 'reform' the worst school funding system in the country with a ticking time bomb of a voucher scheme, and the Illinois Democratic Party has crossed a line which no spin or talk of 'compromise' can ever erase," the CTU said in an Aug. 28 press release. After Rauner signed the new formula into law, the union reiterated its opposition to the scholarship portion. "Instead of raising revenue, the mayor and the governor have attached a parasitic voucher program to the bill to create a tax shelter that will benefit big corporations and billionaire patrons like Ken Griffin," read an Aug. 31 CTU blog post. And as CTU President Karen Lewis welcomed members back to classrooms on Sept. 4, she prefaced her praise of the new formula with yet another condemnation of the scholarship plan as a "voucher program." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "While we’re disappointed that our lawmakers caved to right-wing ideologue Bruce Rauner and created a tax shelter for the wealthy and a voucher program, we believe the new evidence-based school funding formula is a step in the right direction—as we have always said—and brings us closer to at last adequately designating public dollars to fund the schools that Chicago’s students deserve," Lewis wrote in a blog post. The union consistently describes the scholarship plan as a voucher program and a tax shelter that will benefit the wealthy. But is that description accurate? We took a look. Voucher vetting To the CTU, there is no distinction between calling the Invest in Kids Act a "scholarship" program or a "voucher" program. Use of the term "scholarship" is merely a "scheme to get around the constitutional and public relations issues associated with vouchers," said Kurt Hilgendorf, CTU’s policy advisor. "But make no mistake, the mechanism is functionally the same," Hilgendorf said. "Public funds are shifted to private, predominantly religious schools – in Illinois, $375 million over the next five years -- only through a series of clearinghouses in a legal fiction that creates the illusion of no state support for religion." The "clearinghouses" to which Hilgendorf refers are "scholarship granting organizations" -- not-for-profit entities that will be sanctioned by the Illinois Department of Revenue to receive donations and distribute scholarships. Under the Illinois plan, donors will receive state income tax credit for 75 percent of their donations to scholarship funds up to $1 million. The state will grant a maximum of $75 million in scholarship tax credits per year. But they still are tax credits, and that is an important distinction here. "A traditional voucher program uses state funds and so it needs a state appropriation," said Josh Cunningham, who follows school choice programs nationwide for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those programs are different than scholarship plans like the one enacted in Illinois, which Cunningham said "rely on private donations to private organizations. And in exchange for those donations the donors receive a tax credit and that's kind of the incentive to fund the program." The terminology can be confusing. Indiana, for example, has a true voucher system called the Choice Scholarship Program. In the 2016-2017 school year, it distributed $142.2 million in private school tuition vouchers to more than 34,000 students, about 3 percent of its total statewide enrollment. But it also includes a donor-funded scholarship program that provides a 50 percent tax credit and is capped at $12.5 million in tax credits annually. Here’s a look at the numbers from Indiana’s Choice Scholarship Program from its 2017 annual report: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "The most simple way of differentiating between (scholarships and vouchers) is the scholarship tax credit requires individuals or corporations to donate to a scholarship granting organization…," said Robert Gilligan, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Illinois and one of the designers of the Illinois plan. "No donations, no program, no scholarship. So this relies on the goodwill of people and corporations proactively doing this." The Catholic Conference and other school choice advocates tried in 2011 to get a true voucher program through the General Assembly and failed, Gilligan said. He believes the scholarship structure might ultimately be a better program than the one sought six years ago. "From where I sit right now and based on conversations with my colleagues in other states, this scholarship tax credit seems to be working," Gilligan said. "It seems to be working in the states that have tried it and I think that was one of the reasons that people did take to heart and we were talking about this." Gimme shelter Lewis also refers to the program as a "tax shelter for the wealthy," an accusation made by CTU in the Aug. 31 post that referred to hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, who has donated heavily to Rauner’s campaign fund. The plan offers a 75 percent state tax credit for any donor, with a maximum of $750,000 for those who donate $1 million. Donors will reserve their tax credits by registering on a website that will be operated by the Department of Revenue. For the first six months of the year, the credits will be distributed "in a manner geographically proportionate to enrollment in recognized non-public schools in Illinois," according to the statute." If the entire $75 million in credits is not claimed under that formula by June 1, the rest will be granted on a first come, first served basis. Thus the statute ensures that potential donors in all parts of the state will have a chance to get in on the program for the first five months of the year. But there’s no such protection based on the size of donations. So, theoretically, 100 donors giving $1 million each to scholarship granting organizations throughout the state could quickly gobble up all the allowable tax credits. Under that scenario, Lewis would be correct in her "tax shelter for the wealthy" claim. Our ruling The Chicago Teachers Union describes Illinois’ impending private school tax credit scholarship plan as a "voucher program" that amounts to a "tax shelter for the wealthy." It’s clear that "voucher program" to the CTU means any system in which public dollars directly or indirectly reach private schools. By that definition, CTU is correct regarding Illinois’ Invest in Kids Act. But those who follow the issue make a distinction between voucher programs -- in which states directly appropriate funds for private school tuition -- and scholarship credit programs funded with private money and incentivized with tax credits. Illinois’ scholarship program has safeguards to ensure that potential donors from all parts of the state can contribute, but it doesn’t have protections against wealthy donors quickly claiming all $75 million of its tax credits. Lewis’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out some important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-00110	Says "sleazy Keith Ellison and shady Dean Phillips both caught up in another sexual harassment scandal" and that Phillips is "charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/29/erik-paulsen/no-dean-phillips-was-not-involved-sexual-harassmen/	A television ad in Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District attempts to tie Democratic candidate Dean Phillips to a congressman accused of domestic abuse. Phillips’ opponent, Republican congressman Erik Paulsen, aired the ad that starts off by saying "sleazy Keith Ellison and shady Dean Phillips, both caught up in another sexual harassment scandal," making it appear as if the two men are involved in the same scandal. Ellison is accused of domestic abuse by his former girlfriend. The congressman is currently running for Minnesota attorney general and has denied the allegations. But the focus here is the claim that Phillps is "charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies," as the ad’s narrator goes on to say. The full text: "Sleazy Keith Ellison and Shady Dean Phillips, both caught up in another sexual harassment scandal. Ellison accused of physical abuse. Phillips charged with ignoring sexual harassment and discrimination at his companies. Sued over and over again. A whistleblower says he told Phillips' board of the abuse, warning the harassment was a serious problem that was being covered up. Keith Ellison. Dean Phillips. They are the problem. Dean Phillips, your time is up." Phillips is airing a rebuttal ad calling Paulsen's attack false. We wanted to sort out the facts. We found that Phillips is not connected to Ellison’s case, and the allegation against him is based on a decades-old lawsuit filed against an organization where he was once a board member. The ad makes the suggestion that Phillips has been "sued over and over" and was "charged" with ignoring sexual harassment at his companies. We found no evidence that supports either claim. To be clear: Phillips is not involved in the domestic abuse allegations levied against Ellison by a former girlfriend, nor is Phillips involved in any sexual harassment case. The Allina Health lawsuit The Paulsen campaign points to a February 2007 Star Tribune article that discusses a lawsuit brought against Allina Health by seven nurses who said they were sexually harassed by a doctor at one of the health group’s clinics. The case was settled out of court. The news account quotes a letter that was sent by another doctor to an Allina board member. The doctor vouched for the lawsuit, saying the harassment was a serious problem at the clinic and is being "covered up by the Allina administration." Phillips served on the board of directors from 2005 to 2011, and while the board advises Allina, it doesn’t "run the company" as the ad implies. There is also no evidence the note was actually sent to Phillips, and his campaign says he has no memory of receiving such a letter or having any board discussions about the harassment case. Shortly after the ad aired, Lori Peterson, the attorney who represented the women, contacted the Paulsen campaign requesting they take it down. She has not gotten a response, Peterson said, and sent the campaign another note Friday. "You have been asked, for weeks, to stop using my clients in your ads. You have misrepresented their experiences, lied about your opponent, and further traumatized these women," Peterson wrote. "You have dragged these women into your campaign against their will and you won’t even respond to their requests that you stop." She goes on to say that her clients want nothing to do with Paulsen’s campaign, and that she has told him repeatedly that Dean Phillips "had nothing to do with this case. No allegations were made about him and he had no involvement in the litigation." Our ruling Paulsen attempts to tie Phillips to another Democratic candidate involved in a domestic abuse case and says he "ignored sexual harassment allegations at his companies." But Phillips has nothing to do with the accusations against Ellison. Phillips served on the board of a health organization that was sued over sexual harassment allegations in 2007, but the lawyer in that case said he had nothing to do with it. There is also no evidence that proves he was informed or received a letter about the harassment. Paulsen’s ad misleads viewers by connecting Phillips to a domestic abuse case he is not involved in, and implies some sort of formal action was taken against Phillips ("charged with ignoring") at a company he runs, neither of which are true.

pomt-12130	Wisconsin's $3 billion incentive offer to Foxconn is "the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/15/one-wisconsin-now/wisconsins-3-billion-offer-foxconn-gift-and-it-lar/	Perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that when it comes to the $10 billion, 20 million-square-foot factory being promised to Wisconsin, some statements border on the extreme. Foxconn "is bringing" 13,000 jobs. Half True. 3,000 Foxconn jobs would cost Wisconsin $3 billion, or $1 million per job. False. Now comes a claim, made in response to a boast by Gov. Scott Walker, that the $3 billion incentives offer is the largest of its kind. The exchange occurred Aug. 7, 2017 exchange on Twitter, a week and a half after Foxconn, the maker of iPhones and other electronics, announced it would be coming to Wisconsin. Walker tweeted: Our bold reforms have prepared WI for Foxconn & thousands of jobs. Hard-working families will reap the benefits! #WIWinning One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group, retorted: You are willing to give the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company. You got #foxconned, big guy. Wisconsin clearly isn’t offering a gift. The incentives are tied to Foxconn making investments in the plant and in payroll. But the best available source indicates the $3 billion would be the largest ever subsidy provided by a state to a foreign company. One Wisconsin Now’s evidence To back its claim, One Wisconsin Now cited June 2017 data from Good Jobs First, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that calls itself "a leading monitor and critic of company-specific subsidy deals," and has called the the Foxconn deal "a sure loser for Wisconsin taxpayers." We checked with a number of experts on subsidies and none said they knew of any other compilation of subsidies. The experts include Todd Berry, president of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance; Jon Peacock, director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Budget Project; and economists Michael Leeds of Temple University, Charley Ballard of Michigan State University, Jeffrey Michael of the University of Pacific in Stockton, Calif., Sean Snaith at the University of Central Florida; Ball State University’s Michael Hicks; and Tim Bartik of the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. Hicks, who heads Ball State’s Center for Business and Economic Research, told us that while he hasn’t always agreed with analyses done by Good Jobs First, the group’s data on subsidies is solid. And Bartik said it is the best such database he knows. Here are the top 12 subsidies given to companies by states, cities or counties, according to Good Jobs First: Recipient company Parent company Subsidy (in billions) Year State City County Boeing Boeing $8.7 2013 WA Alcoa Alcoa $5.6 2007 NY Massena Boeing Boeing $3.24 2003 WA Everett General Motors General Motors $2.34 2009 MI Orion Township Oakland Ford Motor Ford Motor $2.3 2010 MI statewide Sempra Energy Sempra Energy $2.19 2013 LA Hackberry Cameron Nike Nike $2.02 2012 OR Beaverton Washington Intel Intel $2 2004 NM Rio Rancho Sandoval Intel Intel $2 2014 OR Hillsboro Washington Lake Charles LNG Export Company, LLC Energy Transfer $1.79 2015 LA Lake Charles Calcasieu Cheniere Energy Cheniere Energy $1.69 2010 LA Cameron Cameron Parish Royal Dutch Shell Royal Dutch Shell $1.65 2012 PA The top 11 subsidies are all for American companies. At No. 12 is the estimated $1.65 billion in tax credits Pennsylvania approved for Royal Dutch Shell, which is based in The Netherlands. That package of tax breaks over 25 years was aimed at getting the company to build an ethane refinery that would include a minimum investment of $1 billion and employ at least 2,500 people. Using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, $1.65 billion in 2012 was worth about $2.39 billion as of July 2017 -- so, still well below Wisconsin’s $3 billion offer to Foxconn. (The Good Jobs First database does not take inflation into account.) But there are at least two important points to consider. 1. The $3 billion wouldn’t be a gift, as One Wisconsin Now calls it. That’s the maximum amount the state would pay Foxconn, and only if the company spends roughly $18 billion -- about $9 billion for payroll and $9 billion in capital investments. 2. It’s difficult to calculate the value of the jobs that the various incentives are aimed at creating -- or keeping. Some jobs pay more than others, of course. And some businesses are more likely than others to attract suppliers that might, in turn, create more jobs in a state. Supporters of the Foxconn deal say Wisconsin would win a keystone manufacturer that would bring world-leading technology and attract suppliers that would create their own jobs. Critics say it amounts to a multibillion-dollar bet on a company that makes screens — a product subject to constant market-disrupting competition and innovation. Our rating One Wisconsin Now says Wisconsin's $3 billion incentive offer to Foxconn is "the largest gift ever by a state to a foreign company." The $3 billion wouldn’t be given -- it would be paid, in increments, based on how much Foxconn spends on capital investments and payroll. But the only compilation of government subsidies we found shows that the Foxconn offer would exceed the highest subsidy provided to a foreign company -- $1.65 billion in 2012, made by Pennsylvania to Dutch Royal Shell, based in The Netherlands. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information, our rating is Half True.

pomt-13868	Says Ron Johnson justifies his support of trade agreements by saying the U.S. has the Trade Adjustment Assistance program for displaced workers, but then he "voted to eliminate it."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/06/russ-feingold/testing-russ-feingold-claim-about-opponent-ron-joh/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson tells viewers in a new television ad, "I respect you enough to tell you the truth." But his Democratic challenger has suggested otherwise. At a Milwaukee campaign event in May 2016, Russ Feingold said Johnson touted a worker protection program called Trade Adjustment Assistance to justify his support for free trade agreements — even though Johnson had sought to eliminate the program. Feingold said: "Let's be very clear. Senator Johnson says — to excuse his position on trade agreements — he says, well, we have the TAA. Guess who voted to eliminate it." When Feingold was asked by reporters to elaborate, he said Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers who were eligible for the program. Is Feingold right? How the program works The Trade Adjustment Assistance program dates to the 1970s and was created to help workers who lost their jobs -- or whose wages or hours have been cut -- because of foreign competition. The program, in part, offers displaced workers temporary benefits and pays to train them with new skills so they can find a new job. In Wisconsin, the federal government has spent nearly $220 million in the last six years for worker benefits and training, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. That includes money for enhanced vocational training through the state’s technical colleges in programs such as information technology, healthcare and manufacturing. Proponents of the TAA program say it can lessen the blow of job losses that occur when companies move operations overseas to reduce labor costs — a practice that critics contend is facilitated by free trade agreements the United States has struck with other countries. Johnson has voiced general support for free trade, while Feingold voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement when he was a U.S. senator and has opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Feingold’s claim has two parts: Did Johnson specifically cite the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a defense of trade agreements? When we asked Feingold’s campaign for backup, officials pointed to a statement Johnson made in a May 2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article: "Free trade does help all economies. And there are dislocations. There are protections against those dislocations. We all support being able to help workers that have been displaced." Despite what Feingold said, Johnson did not explicitly refer to the TAA in that statement. Rather he voiced general support for helping displaced workers. Indeed, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us the TAA is "ineffective and duplicative" and in need of "major reforms." Johnson’s campaign also pointed to a House Budget Committee report that said the federal government has other forms of aid, including at least 35 job training programs among eight departments and agencies. There are "dozens of programs to help people who need assistance," Reisinger said. Did Johnson vote to eliminate the Trade Adjustment Assistance program? Johnson voted in September 2011 against a bill to reauthorize the program, although the measure passed despite his opposition. Feingold also noted that Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers eligible for TAA help. Those grants were part of the 2009 economic stimulus package, which was approved before Johnson was in office. But Johnson voted for legislation in 2011 that would have reduced TAA spending to pre-2009 levels; that proposal also failed. At the time, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said he offered the measure because of concerns with TAA’s effectiveness and because stimulus spending was supposed to be temporary. Our rating Feingold said Johnson had referred to the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to defend his position on trade agreements — but had voted against the TAA. However, Johnson referred only generally to worker "protections," not to the TAA specifically. He did vote against reauthorizing the program in 2011 and also voted around the same time to pare down funding, which would have had the effect of cutting a career training program. Our definition for Mostly False is "The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."

pomt-02537	Says President Barack Obama carried Congressional District 13 "by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/06/george-will/presidential-election-results-rep-cw-bill-youngs-o/	Conservative pundit George Will honed in on Florida’s Pinellas County for a column about the closely watched special election to fill the shoes of the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young. Headlining the March 11 race are Democrat Alex Sink and Republican David Jolly. Reporters covering the race usually call it a toss-up district, pointing out President Barack Obama had "narrow" wins in 2008 and 2012. (Young typically won by comfortable margins; he was a 40-plus year incumbent.) Will described Obama’s wins differently -- and incorrectly. "Obama carried this Gulf Coast district, a one-county constituency near Tampa, by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012." Florida’s 13th Congressional District covers most of Pinellas County, but not all of it. The district stretches from South Pinellas to Dunedin, excluding pieces of southern and downtown St. Petersburg. Will’s column links to election returns from Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections for 2008 and 2012. But he was trying to explain how the congressional district -- and not the county -- voted in those presidential races. The fact that it doesn’t cover the entire county is an important distinction. If the entire county was included, the district would lean more to the left, as Will’s links show. Voting data by congressional district is available, but a lot harder to uncover because it must be tabulated by the precincts in the district (and those change every 10 years). Neither the Florida Department of State nor the Pinellas County elections supervisor’s office keep it. We had luck with the Florida Legislature, which in 2012 wrapped up its once-a-decade redistricting process. The Florida House developed a Web tool called My District Builder that allows data-savvy users to play with the demographic and political information of constituents in various congressional and legislative districts. The election data comes from the Florida Department of State and local elections supervisors. Using this tool, we found: In 2008, Obama earned 51.32 percent of the vote in Young’s old seat (District 10) and Republican candidate Sen. John McCain got 47.14 percent. That’s a margin of 4.18 percentage points. In 2012, Obama garnered 49.95 percent of the CD-13 vote versus Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s 48.49 percent, a margin of almost 1.5 percentage points. Other efforts to analyze the presidential vote by congressional district in 2008 and 2012 produce similar findings, including CNN, NBC News and the liberal Daily Kos. We also consulted David Wasserman, House editor of The Cook Political Report, which has voting data by congressional district prepared by PolitiData. Because the boundaries of Young’s district varied in the elections in question, Wasserman argues it is more fair to compare the 2008 votes of constituents who live in present-day District 13 (versus turnout for then-District 10) with the 2012 returns there. The results are not significantly different from what we found in our exercise with My District Builder (and certainly a lot closer than Will’s.) In 2008, 51.33 percent of voters living within the boundaries of current-day District 13 chose Obama, and 47.54 percent chose McCain -- a difference of nearly 3.8 points. In 2012, 50.25 percent of voters chose Obama and 48.77 chose Romney -- a difference of 1.48 points. Because Will relied on the number of voter registrations in the county and not the district, his column also errantly suggests that Democrats outnumber Republicans in Congressional District 13. He wrote, "This is a purple but not a polarized district, with 37 percent Democrat and 36 percent Republican." Those numbers are wrong, too. The party breakdown for the district is 37.1 percent Republican and 34.6 percent Democrat, said Nancy Whitlock, a spokeswoman for the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections. We reached out to Will and his researcher for comment but did not hear back. Our ruling Will wrote that Obama carried the 13th Congressional District "by 8.2 points in 2008 and 5.6 points in 2012." He was using countywide election returns. Using returns from the actual congressional district show a much smaller margin of victory for Obama in both presidential elections. Obama carried the district by about 4 points in 2008 and about 1.5 points 2012. We rate Will’s statement False.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2014-02-06T18:34:30	2014-02-06	['None']
pomt-08074	Says that "on average, Democratic congressional districts received 81 percent more stimulus funds than Republican districts."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/21/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-says-democratic-districts/	U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, slammed the federal government's spending habits under President Barack Obama in a Nov. 22 op-ed piece in the Austin American-Statesman, singling out the roughly $800 billion stimulus plan that passed last year. After asserting that the program is wasteful, Hutchison said: "It has been reported that, on average, Democratic congressional districts received 81 percent more stimulus funds than Republican districts." She went on: "Unelected bureaucrats in Washington ... shouldn't be empowered to distribute taxpayer dollars with little or no intimate knowledge of a state or community's need — or, worse, guided by a political agenda that will serve some and neglect others." First, just because Hutchison describes this statistic as "reported" doesn't let her off the hook when making claims to her constituents. So, we took the hint from several readers who asked us to truth-test Hutchison's "81 percent" statement. Next, some background: The stimulus, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, includes tax cuts and spending programs designed to pump money into the economy, create jobs and end the recession. The Obama administration created Recovery.gov so the public could track the stimulus spending, which is being spread out over 10 years. The website keeps tabs on only about a third of the money: the $275 billion that is being paid out by federal agencies through contracts, grants and loans to state and local governments, nonprofit groups and private companies. Not included are the tax breaks to individuals and businesses, additional money being sent to states for education and health care, and direct aid to individuals such as unemployment benefits. Hutchison spokeswoman Courtney Sanders told us the 81 percent statistic came from a report by Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, which describes itself as a "source for market-oriented ideas." Sanders sent us de Rugy's March 31 National Review Online blog post summarizing her statistical analysis of contract and grant data that recipients reported to Recovery.gov from February through September 2009. The total spending in de Rugy's analysis: $170 billion, which constitutes 21 percent of stimulus dollars overall. As part of her analysis, Rugy sorted the awards by congressional district and labeled each district based on the political party of its U.S. House member. One of her findings: "The average dollars awarded per Republican district is $260,675,663, while the average dollars awarded per Democratic district is $471,533,539." Those numbers reflect a Democratic average that is 81 percent greater than the Republican one. Her work was quickly challenged by blogger Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, a site devoted to analyzing political numbers that became part of The New York Times' website in August 2010. In his April 1 post, Silver wrote that de Rugy’s study "purporting to find a connection between stimulus spending and the partisanship of a district suffers from an obvious flaw" by overlooking an important factor in stimulus fund distribution: the location of each state’s capital city. Silver notes that according to de Rugy’s tally, the four districts that received the largest amounts of stimulus funding contain all or part of the capitals of the nation’s four biggest states: California, Texas, New York and Florida. "This … makes perfect sense," Silver's post says. "A lot of stimulus funds are distributed to state agencies, which are then responsible for allocating and administering the funds to the presumed benefit of citizens throughout the state. These state agencies, of course, are usually located in or near the state capital." According to Silver, de Rugy's data show that the 18 congressional districts that received the most stimulus funding contain part or all of a capital city. Of those 18 districts, only three are represented by a Republican, including the Texas 21st, whose congressman is Lamar Smith of San Antonio. His district, which ranked third in stimulus funding, includes the Texas Capitol complex and the University of Texas at Austin. Another Austin-area district, Democrat Lloyd Doggett’s 25th, which contains part of downtown, ranks 14th. None of the 30 other Texas districts made the top 50 list. According to Silver, the 78 congressional districts across the United States that contain part or all of a capital collectively received $118 billion, compared with $48 billion for the 357 districts that are not home to capitals. Silver wrote that districts with state capitals "are much more likely to elect Democrats to Congress" because they are usually urban; are home to large numbers of government workers (who "may be more sympathetic to bigger government"); have highly educated populations; and often are home to large state universities. Silver suggested that de Rugy adjust her analysis to take into account whether a district contains a capital. She did, and on April 7 blogged on National Review Online that "even after taking out the money spent through state capitals," Democratic districts still received 30 percent more stimulus funds, on average, than Republican districts. De Rugy's research assistant at the Mercatus Center, Jakina Debnam, told us that after removing capital districts from the analysis, the average for Democratic and Republican districts fell to $143 million and $111 million, respectively, giving Democratic districts a 29 percent edge. De Rugy raised the partisanship issue again in a Sept. 24 National Review Online post about a paper by two Georgia State University political scientists, Jeffrey Lazarus and Jason Reifler, who also analyzed the distribution of stimulus contracts and grants by congressional district. "They find that the partisan bias does exist," de Rugy's post says. "More interestingly, they explain how and why it happens." In their paper, Lazarus and Reifler confirm that Democratic districts got more stimulus money than Republican ones. But they contend that the results reflect majority rule; Democrats were in the majority in the House and Senate when the stimulus plan passed. "Congressional majority parties routinely shape legislation to distribute federal funds according to their own policy priorities, and to politically benefit their own members," the article says. An example of those priorities in the stimulus package, Lazarus told us, was the desire to improve health care. "So districts with a lot of hospitals got extra money," thanks to the stimulus, he said — and the districts with more hospitals are in urban areas that tend to be represented by Democrats. Next, we briefed Sanders, Hutchison's spokeswoman, on the de Rugy analysis that excluded state-capital congressional districts. Sanders stuck by the 81 percent figure which, she noted, has not been retracted by de Rugy. Still, we wondered why Hutchison's op-ed piece left the impression that she was talking about all stimulus funds, not just a portion of them. Sanders' response: "The op-ed does not say that — that's your interpretation." To the Truth-O-Meter: Hutchison's statement accurately draws from a researcher's analysis showing that 81 percent of $170 billion in stimulus grants and contracts went to congressional districts represented by Democrats. However, after an analyst suggested that stimulus data from districts with state capitals tended to skew the results, the researcher re-ran her analysis while excluding those districts. Using that methodology, Democratic districts on average received 29 percent more stimulus funds than GOP districts — not 81 percent. Hutchison also fails to note that the $170 billion being scrutinized is about one-fifth of total stimulus spending, not the whole package. We rate Hutchison's statement Half True.

pomt-07528	Says House Republicans rejected a straightforward measure that would prevent members of Congress and the president from being paid during a government shutdown.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/06/barbara-boxer/congress-cant-agree-cutting-its-own-pay-event-gove/	We’ve found something Republicans and Democrats say they agree on: If Congress shuts down, members of Congress should not be paid during the closure. Current law says they get their paychecks, shut down or no. Yet when someone actually proposes changing the law, things start to get a little, well, weird. We figured it was time for a fact-check when Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., accused House Republicans of voting down language she had proposed to stop the congressional paychecks. Instead, she said, the Republicans adopted a bill containing a provision designed to ensure that it would die in the Democratic-controlled Senate. "Attaching their pay measure to a bill that has no prayer of ever becoming law shows House Republicans are not serious about ‘no budget, no pay,’" Boxer said Friday. "This is nothing more than an April Fools’ Day gimmick." Back in February, Boxer announced she was introducing legislation to stop members of Congress from being paid during a shutdown. "Failing to keep the government open because of politics, or because there’s no will to compromise, is a failure of government," Boxer said. "If the government is forced to shutdown, members of Congress and the president should be treated like all other federal employees: We should not be paid. And to take it one step further, we should not be paid retroactively once the government re-opens." It’s strange but true: Members of Congress get paid during a shutdown, even though most other federal employees do not. Also exempt from a pay freeze are the president, presidential appointees, certain legislative branch employees and employees either doing emergency work or ensuring an orderly shutdown, according to a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The report noted that in the past federal employees were paid retroactively once shutdowns ended. Boxer’s bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on March 1. Now let’s look and see what’s happened over in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. The House voted on Friday, April 1, 2011, to stop pay for members of Congress as part of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. But the act also contained a provision that the Democrats in the Senate were sure to reject. The act says that if the Senate doesn’t approve a budget, then the provisions of the House budget bill already rejected by the Senate "are hereby enacted into law." The original Republican budget proposal had been rejected by the Senate on a 44-56 vote back on March 9. So House Republicans are asking the Senate to approve a bill that says if the Senate didn’t approve another bill, the House version of the budget becomes law. That would appear to violate the U.S. Constitution, which says both chambers must approve laws which then must be signed by the president. We’ve never heard of anything like this before, and we were frankly perplexed by the idea. We asked majority leader Eric Cantor’s office for a comment on this, but we didn’t hear back. So we turned to longtime government watcher Norm Ornstein of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "First of all, it is farcical," Ornstein said. "Of course, no bill can be ‘deemed’ into law without passage by both houses in identical form and the signature of the president (or a veto overridden by two-thirds of both houses). … I have never seen anything like this, for good reason." "This is all about one thing and one thing only: trying to shift blame if there is a shutdown," he added. Getting back to Boxer’s statement, she said the House had a chance to vote on a more straightforward "no budget, no pay" bill, without the references to one-chamber approval of the House budget bill. There was a motion to substitute the text of Boxer’s bill and remove references to H.R. 1, the house budget bill. But the motion, proposed by Rep. Tim Walz, D-Minn., failed on a largely party line vote, with Republicans voting no and Democrats voting yes. Finally, there’s one more issue at work here, and it’s a significant one: It might be unconstitutional for Congress to cut its own pay or that of the president. Article II, Section 1 says the president’s compensation "shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected." The 27th amendment, meanwhile, says, "No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened." So the whole argument over "no budget, no pay" may be moot anyway. So to sum up: The House passed a bill to stop pay for members during a shutdown. But the measure clearly had a poison pill provision on a different topic -- the budget itself, which is the cause of the impasse in the first place. The House did have a chance to vote on something similar to Boxer’s bill, but it turned it down on a near party-line vote. So Boxer is correct on that point. There’s still a question whether her bill is would pass constitutional muster. We won’t find out, though, because the two chambers seem unlikely to agree on legislation. Given that impasse, we rate Boxer’s statement Mostly True.	None	Barbara Boxer	None	None	None	2011-04-06T10:46:10	2011-04-01	['United_States_Congress', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-13239	"Gov. (Pat) McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund. And you know what it’s for? House Bill 2."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/19/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-says-pat-mccrory-took-500000-disaster-r/	As flooding from Hurricane Matthew continues to ravage much of eastern North Carolina, even days after the storm subsided, the state’s preparedness has become a political fight. Roy Cooper, the Democratic challenger for governor who is also the state’s attorney general, accused Republican Gov. Pat McCrory of a short-sighted move to divert emergency funds into defending a partisan controversy. "Gov. McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund," Cooper said during their Oct. 11 debate. "And you know what it’s for? House Bill 2." HB2, or the "bathroom bill" as it’s commonly known, has become one of the defining issues of this election. There are several parts to it, including restricting bathroom access for transgender people in public buildings and excluding LGBT people from discrimination protections. We’ve written many fact-checks on HB2, including whether it took away any existing rights, how unique North Carolina’s LGBT protections (or lack thereof) are now, and the risk of sexual predators due to transgender-friendly bathroom rules. For all our fact checks on the law, see here. McCrory signed HB2 in March. Since then private citizens have sued, and so has the U.S. Department of Justice, which argues it violates civil rights laws. Cooper, as attorney general, has refused to defend HB2 in court. He says he believes it’s unconstitutional. We fact-checked whether he’s allowed to do that here. With Cooper out, the state will have to hire other lawyers – unless the legislature repeals HB2, which Cooper has urged but which legislative leaders have so far refused to do. And that’s what brings us to this claim. Cooper said McCrory pulled $500,000 from disaster funds to use for those lawyers, but McCrory retorted it wasn’t true. "We haven’t spent one dollar of the disaster relief money. We were approved to by the legislature, and I made a statement: We will not spend any of that money. (Cooper) knows that. He’s being deceptive to the public of North Carolina." McCrory’s campaign later called Cooper’s claim "the lie of the night." Starting with the basics Cooper is right about the amount of money. A new law ordered the transfer of $500,000 of disaster relief money to McCrory’s office for "costs incurred from litigation related to" HB2. Cooper said McCrory "took" that money, but "took" has multiple meanings. One is more active, like "grabbed. " The other is more passive, like "accepted." It might also refer to a certain foolish hobbit, but we won’t get into that. So we need to ask if McCrory actively took the money, passively took the money, or both. Let’s start with passive taking. Did McCrory accept the money? Did he object to it? Veto power Cooper’s main argument during the debate was that McCrory didn’t object to the money being moved, since he allowed the bill in question to become law. "The governor could’ve vetoed this legislation that took this $500,000 out of the Disaster Relief Fund, but he did not," Cooper said. "He did not veto it." The money came to McCrory on July 1 in a bill making multiple changes and corrections to the state budget. McCrory said he didn’t veto the bill because he didn’t want to risk stopping other important changes if his veto succeeded. But that excuse doesn’t hold water. The legislature could’ve easily overridden his veto, which requires a 60-percent majority to do. This bill received 46 of 50 votes in the Senate (92 percent) and 89 of 120 votes in the House (74 percent). McCrory has issued six vetoes as governor, four of which have been overridden. His latest came less than a month before this budget bill. At the time, he said it would probably be overridden but "part of the reason to veto a bill is to make sure the public is aware of exactly what’s in a bill." And less than a week before the funding bill came to his desk, he threatened to veto another bill over several parts that he didn’t like; the legislature rewrote those parts in response. However, after McCrory let the funding bill become law, he did almost immediately say he had no intention of actually using the money – a statement he repeated again at the debate. Show me the money So McCrory accepted the money with no strong formal objections, like a veto. We also know that McCrory asked for $500,000 to be set aside for lawyers for HB2 – that it wasn’t just imposed on him by the legislature. But both McCrory’s general counsel, Bob Stephens, and the office of Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger have said McCrory just asked for the money in general and never specifically suggested pulling it from disaster relief funds – so the legislature bears responsibility for that choice. But where’s the money now? The budget changes say that the $500,000 from the disaster relief fund "shall be transferred to the Governor's Office" for HB2’s legal costs. However, Berger’s office told us the money has yet to actually be transferred, despite the apparently authoritative wording of the law. "As a practical matter, $500,000 has not been moved from the disaster relief fund," said Berger spokeswoman Shelly Carver. She added: "Further, the governor has said he will not spend any disaster relief funds on legal expenses, which is within his discretion." But similarly, McCrory also has the discretion to move the money in the future if he wants. And what’s less clear is whether the money could still move even against his wishes, since the law says the funds "shall transfer" to his office. The word "shall" is tricky in legal writing and we simply don’t know exactly how it might be interpreted here. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in 1995 that "though shall generally means must, legal writers sometimes use, or misuse, shall to mean should, will or even may." Our ruling Cooper said "Governor McCrory took $500,000 directly out of the disaster relief fund" to spend on lawyers to defend the controversial HB2 legislation. McCrory did ask for the money, although there’s no proof he asked for it to be taken specifically from disaster relief – an especially touchy topic now with so much flooding ravaging the state. The money is still in the disaster relief fund, which is a mark against Cooper’s claim, but nevertheless it is still earmarked for HB2, meaning McCrory could take it in the future. And although he has said he won’t, he also didn’t attempt to stop the money from being moved out of disaster relief by using his veto power. Cooper’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/efeebeee-92f2-47c8-8826-dab5f32e372e	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2016-10-19T09:54:13	2016-10-11	['None']
pomt-13908	"The major immigration issue was about Poles, and Bulgarians, and Romanians," and that they weren’t contributing economically. "The unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is lower than the unemployment rate among Brits."	true	/global-news/statements/2016/jun/26/david-miliband/david-miliband-link-between-jobs-immigration-and-b/	Backers of the British vote to leave the European Union, or Brexit, might see a rosy economic future, but the immediate effects have been rough to say the least. The value of the pound tumbled, as did stock markets worldwide, and the International Monetary Fund downgraded the United Kingdom’s prospects of growth. Popular anger with a 10-year influx of European workers was a major driver behind the "Leave" vote, former British lawmaker David Miliband told NBC host Chuck Todd. There was a strong sense that immigrants, particularly those from the former Eastern Bloc, were taking advantage of Britain’s welfare services. For the largest group, Poles, Miliband said that wasn’t the case. "The unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is lower than the unemployment rate among Brits," he said on Meet the Press on June 26, 2016. Miliband is certainly correct that an influx of immigrants from countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Romania (and their reliance on government services) was a central theme in the "leave" movement. He’s also correct that Poles working in the United Kingdom are less likely than natives of the United Kingdom to find themselves unemployed, according to the latest numbers we could find. Britain’s Office of National Statistics conducts the country’s quarterly Labour Force Survey. According to Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, in the last quarter of 2015, the unemployment rate for Poles was 3.5 percent, while the national rate stood at 5 percent. Sumption cautioned us on the numbers, noting that as in the United States, the unemployment rate is based on a survey. And with a relatively small amount of Poles living, and thus working, in the United Kingdom (a bit under 800,000 vs. the total population of 64 million), the data is somewhat thin. "The numbers hop around a bit from quarter to quarter," Sumption cautioned. That’s due to the small number of Poles in the survey, "but it has always been the case that Poles have lower unemployment than Brits." The gap has been consistent. We used the labor survey from the first quarter of 2015 and got results similar to Sumption. (We looked at the unemployment rate of British nationals, not the average rate for the nation as a whole.) First quarter 2015 Employed Unemployed British 94.80% 5.20% Polish 95.90% 4.10% Further confirmation comes from a 2011 Office of National Statistics report that found Polish unemployment was 5.5 percent back when the overall British rate was 7.8 percent. The problem with low unemployment While Miliband had his numbers right, his statistic missed one of the major complaints against the Poles -- that their presence makes life harder for the average British worker. When Poland along with seven other Eastern and Central European countries joined the European Union in 2004, the United Kingdom was one of only three nations that allowed the newcomers to come and work immediately. Over the years, more than half a million Poles arrived. In the 2010 European parliament elections, the pushback in Britain was palpable. The UK Independence Party, a right-leaning group, made immigration control a key issue, running ads that claimed immigrants were driving wages down. Our fact-checking colleagues in the United Kingdom, Full Fact, reported that such complaints had merit. They found that a 1 percent increase in the population of migrants was tied to a drop of .3 percent to .6 percent in wages. On the other hand, there was no clear relationship to say that immigrants took jobs away from native British workers. Our ruling Miliband said, "The major immigration issue was about Poles, and Bulgarians, and Romanians," and that they weren’t contributing economically. "The unemployment rate among Poles in Britain is lower than the unemployment rate among Brits." The official government numbers back him up. The most recent data we found had Poles with a 3.5 percent rate,compared to 5 percent for the nation as a whole. The gap has been consistent for at least several years. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6fa16754-3e34-467c-837d-86a0b94b2ab8	None	David Miliband	None	None	None	2016-06-26T17:33:07	2016-06-26	['United_Kingdom', 'Romanians', 'Bulgarians']
pomt-04657	"After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/10/barack-obama/obama-fuel-standards-inaction/	President Barack Obama claimed a record of accomplishment as he accepted the Democratic nomination to run for a second term — including a victory on one issue he said hadn’t been touched in three decades. "After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas," he told delegates to the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6, 2012. We rated Obama’s original presidential campaign pledge to raise fuel economy standards a Promise Kept. But we wondered, was it true that "after 30 years of inaction," fuel standards will double for cars and trucks by 2025? That might be news to President George W. Bush. What Obama did In August 2011, the Obama administration issued new federal fuel economy rules that set an average fuel efficiency goal of 54.5 miles per gallon for the 2025 model year. That’s nearly twice the 27.6 miles per gallon standard for 2011, for cars and for trucks. So far, so good. But we paused at Obama’s claim that his administration took action "after 30 years of inaction." Mileage standards in the United States have been in place since the 1970s Arab oil embargo. Back then, Congress passed the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975, which boosted the fuel economy of cars and light trucks. "Corporate average fuel economy," or CAFE, standards reached 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 — then hovered there. Obama’s speech might have left you thinking nothing else happened until his administration took charge. But in 2007, Bush signed the Energy Independence and Securities Act, which required "substantial, continuing increases in fuel economy standards," according to a helpful history lesson at auto information site Edmunds.com. Bush noted at his signing ceremony that the law marked the first statutory increase in fuel economy standards since they were enacted — something he had asked for. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then speaker of the House, remarked on the historic nature of the bipartisan legislation, writing that its auto efficiency reforms were "the first in more than 30 years." And that law laid the groundwork for Obama’s rule changes. Bush’s administration left for Obama’s the job of finalizing standards, something it hadn’t yet done "because of the uncertainty gripping car companies," Reuters reported. "A lot of what Obama's doing is really extending what President Bush started," Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman for Edmunds.com, told PolitiFact in January. That’s not what Obama’s sweeping oversimplification suggested. The president also said that "by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas." That’s what the new rules require. Edmunds.com reports that "regulators, environmentalists and most automakers agree that existing technologies can be used to achieve this plan's goals." There’s just debate about their cost. While automakers have so far met boosted standards by updating traditional engines, Anwyl says those relatively inexpensive gains won't carry companies through lofty goals set for 2025. Still, 13 automakers in August announced support for the new standards, signaling they believe they’ll be able to achieve the gains. Our ruling Obama said, "After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas." The Obama administration launched new fuel efficiency standards that significantly raise the bar for automakers over the next decade. But the rules, which raise standards from their 1985 levels, grew from a bipartisan law requested and signed by Bush. We’ll give Obama credit for pushing for a long-term agreement with aggressive goals and working with automakers who say they’ll get it done. But he’s on shakier ground when he gives the impression his administration was solely responsible. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-08122	Sheldon Whitehouse and 18 other senators "voted to censor the internet."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/10/blog-posting/bloggers-say-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-voted-censor-i/	As the WikiLeaks controversy rages and concerns about web censorship in China percolate, another Internet debate has erupted closer to home. Bloggers, legal scholars, tech gurus and a host of others have accused 19 U.S. senators, Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse among them, of voting to censor the Internet. The claims are intense -- hundreds of them sprinkled all over the Internet -- and they are angry. The vote they're talking about happened Nov. 18, when the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the "Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act," a bill they say would help the Justice Department crack down on websites that "sell or distribute" counterfeit or illegally copied goods, such as music or prescription medication. If passed, the law would allow the U.S. attorney general to seek a court order to block a web address "dedicated to infringing activities," in other words, sites whose only function is to traffic in counterfeit or unauthorized goods. If and only if a judge were to agree, the federal government could order the Internet provider to essentially remove that site from public view. The site wouldn't actually be gone. It would still be available through its I.P. address, a numerical identification code, for users savvy enough to find it that way. The goal of the infringement bill is to curb online piracy and protect intellectual property by policing sites that violate the policy, according to its co-sponsor and Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. "Rogue websites are essentially digital stores selling illegal and sometimes dangerous products. If they existed in the physical world, the store would be shuttered immediately and the proprietors arrested," Leahy wrote in a Dec. 7 commentary in The Hill, a congressional publication. "There is no excuse for this behavior simply because it happens online and owners operate overseas. The internet needs to be free -- not lawless." The bill awaits consideration by the full Senate, which probably won't take up the issue before the lame-duck session ends. But that didn't stop the buzz on the blogosphere. That same day, Wired.com posted a story under the headline "Web censorship bill sails through Senate committee." Techdirt, a leading technology blog, offered its own version: "The 19 Senators who voted to censor the Internet." Buttressing those allegations was a strongly worded letter to the committee from a group of 49 prominent law professors who offered a grim assessment: "For the first time, the United States would be requiring Internet service providers to block speech because of its content." First amendment groups and others expressed similar opposition. The bill may be meant to target counterfeiters and pirates, but skeptics say they worry that, regardless of the original intent, it could create a framework that might one day allow zealous judges to block sites such as YouTube and Facebook, where users may unwittingly share copyrighted material. The threat to free speech is hard to ignore, they say. "The genesis of law is to go after the worst of the worst offenders, but I fear it’s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line," said David L. Hudson Jr., a scholar at the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University. Those opposed say the legislation would also allow the Justice Department to blacklist websites with limited judicial review, blocking access to them through "prior restraint" before it is determined that the site is operating unlawfully. Above all, critics say the bill threatens the very freedoms that make the Internet's flow of ideas so valuable. "One thing people are really worried about is a worst case scenario -- for example, a politically biased AG using the bill if it became law to shut down a website just because he or she doesn’t agree with it," said Roger Williams University School of Law Assistant Prof. Zoe Argento, who was among the professors who signed the letter to Congress. Argento cited the potential example of a blogger reprinting large portions of former President George W. Bush's new memoir for the purposes of criticizing it. A politically motivated attorney general could use the law to block the website, as opposed to going through the traditional process of a legal challenge where both sides are heard. On the other side of this very heated issue, supporters, among them the entertainment industry and even the American Newspaper Association, say something must be done to protect intellectual property from online thieves. As of now, there are only a few means of recourse against such infringement: going after the individuals -- college students, etc. -- who purchased counterfeit materials, or by suing Internet service providers, thereby engaging in a protracted civil court battle. The infringement legislation, they say, will allow them to use the federal justice system to go straight to the source of a costly problem. They dismiss concerns about the bill's so-called slippery slope, stressing the rigorous judicial review that all cases would have to undergo to ensure that the law applies. Websites can be blocked only if the U.S. attorney general can prove that it "has no demonstrable, commercially significant purpose or use other than" to traffic in infringed or counterfeit goods. In instances when copyrighted material has been stolen, the original, legitimate site will not be touched. "The law is meant to go after offenders who are the worst of the worst violators of intellectual property law. They are profiting off others work and the Supreme Court has held that such violations are not protected speech," said Matt Thornton, a spokesman for Whitehouse. Leahy in his commentary piece agreed. "Some have argued the conduct should be excused as free speech because it happens on the Internet," he wrote. "That argument contradicts the basic tenet of copyright law, which, as Justice [Sandra Day] O'Connor explained, is the very 'engine of free expression.' " Even if you believe the bill is flawed, said Villanova School of Law Associate Prof. Michael Risch, "when you view it in the most technical way, it's not censorship because the website is still up, you can still get to it through the I.P. address." Now back to the initial claim. It's clear the 19 senators voted unanimously to approve the bill, but does that constitute censoring the Internet? We argue that it does not. Censorship is defined as the deletion of speech or content considered objectionable. For example, when the Chinese blocked websites related to Tiananmen Square, that was censorship. In this case, the sites this law could be applied to do not offer free speech of any kind, they distribute stolen or counterfeit goods. Even if you don't agree with that interpretation, consider what Hudson of the First Amendment Center told us: "I fear it’s going to lead to Internet censorship down the line." The key there is the phrase "down the line." That may well be true. The threat of censorship could loom. But we simply do not know that for sure. And that was not the intention of the senators who voted in favor of the bill. Had the bloggers proclaimed that the vote "could lead to censorship," they'd be offering an opinion and we'd let them off the hook. But they didn't qualify their statements. They made bold allegations that relied on conjecture, not fact, thereby declaring that the bill will immediately censor the Internet. It will not. We find this statement False.

pomt-11910	An undocumented immigrant "was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents."	false	/california/statements/2017/oct/20/breitbart/breitbarts-false-and-inflammatory-claim-about-dead/	As authorities continued to investigate the cause of Northern California’s deadly wildfires this week, they refuted what they described as false claims started by the conservative website Breitbart about their investigation. A Breitbart article on Oct. 17, 2017 said Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, "was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents." Sonoma County sheriff's officials tell a much different story and have called the Breitbart report "completely false." Even so, the article quickly spread across right-wing media outlets, including InfoWars and the Drudge Report, which shared Breitbart's unsubstantiated claims -- as detailed by BuzzFeed News. The series of wind-driven fires that started Oct. 8, 2017 has destroyed more than 8,400 homes, businesses and other buildings and killed at least 42 people across Northern California. It is the most deadly series of fires in California’s history. While there’s a strong desire for answers about what caused the fires, the investigation is still in its early stages. We decided to fact check Breitbart’s controversial claim that Gonzalez is now the target of an arson probe connected to the deadly fires, despite arguments to the contrary by authorities. Our research We started by reviewing comments by Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano at a press conference on Oct. 17, 2017, the same day Breitbart’s article was published. The sheriff said his deputies arrested Gonzalez two days earlier on a felony arson charge for allegedly starting "a small fire" that was unconnected to the larger blazes and was quickly put out. Gonzalez, a Sonoma Valley man who sheriff's officials described as homeless, told deputies he lit the fire to stay warm. A statement by federal immigration authorities indicates Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. Here’s the sheriff’s statement at the press conference: "There’s a little rumor control issue. We, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s office, arrested a man on Sunday for arson in the Maxwell Park in Sonoma. There’s a story out there that he’s the arsonist for these fires. That’s not the case. There is no indication he is related to these fires at all. CalFire is doing an investigation into how these fires started. We don’t even know if it’s arson." Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano press conference Oct. 17, 2017. Cal Fire, or the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, is in charge of battling the wildfires and is the lead investigative agency. Daniel Berlant, Cal Fire’s assistant deputy director, told PolitiFact California on Oct. 20, 2017, that its investigation was "ongoing" and that it has "not yet determined any specific causes." He declined to comment specifically on Gonzalez, saying Cal Fire would work with the Sonoma County sheriff’s office to investigate anyone suspected in the large fires. "There’s a lot of speculation on what may have started the fires. People want to know who is to blame," Berlant said. "When we have an arson suspect, that’s going to be made public immediately." Berlant clarified that the agency has yet to determine whether arson is even the cause of the large fires, adding there are a host of other possibilities. "Completely false, bad, wrong information" Sgt. Spencer Crum, spokesperson for the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, was blunt in describing Breitbart’s role in fueling false rumors. Breitbart is run by Steve Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist. Crum told BuzzFeed on Oct. 19, 2017 that the rumors about Gonzalez are "completely false, bad, wrong information that Breitbart started and is being put out into the public in a very strong way." Crum added in the BuzzFeed article that a Breitbart reporter called the department only to inquire about Gonzalez's race and if ICE had placed a detainer on him. "After they published that story we started getting a lot of calls," he added. "There is no indication Mr. Gonzalez is connected to the wildfires. None. Breitbart made that up themselves." The Breitbart reporter who wrote the article did not respond to our request for comment. In the article, Breitbart also reported that the U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency, or ICE, issued "a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail" for Gonzalez. Giordano, the Sonoma County sheriff, confirmed through a statement posted online on Oct. 19, 2017 that ICE made that request. He added that Gonzalez remained in jail in lieu of $200,000 bail. Half of that is for a misdemeanor drug warrant from Ventura County, he said. The sheriff also detailed what he described as several misleading comments by ICE when that agency released a statement this week about past detainer requests it made to the Sonoma County sheriff’s office related to Gonzalez. Our ruling An article on the conservative website Breitbart recently claimed that Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who federal officials have indicated is an undocumented immigrant, "was arrested on suspicion of arson in (the) Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents." Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordono said deputies arrested Gonzalez for an unrelated small fire a week after the deadly blazes started. The sheriff added that "there is no indication he is related to these fires at all." A Cal Fire spokesman said the agency has not identified an arson suspect nor has it determined whether arson was the cause of the deadly fires. Sonoma County sheriff’s officials have pointed to Breitbart for fueling false rumors about their investigation. At this point, there’s been no suspect identified and no arrests made tied to these deadly fires, contrary to the website’s inaccurate and irresponsible claim. We rate Breitbart’s claim False.

pomt-07759	The richest 400 taxpayers are taxed at a lower rate than a $29,000-a-year worker	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/feb/25/sheldon-whitehouse/whitehouse-says-richest-400-taxpayers-taxed-lower-/	Are the rich undertaxed? The answer often depends on who is speaking and how they choose to look at it. Those who argue that the rich are actually overtaxed may say, for example, that the people whose incomes are in the top 1 percent pay roughly 23 percent of all federal taxes. (Others who have this opinion argue that the burden on the rich is even higher. PolitiFact.com examined those claims in 2010.) At a Feb. 13 community dinner at the Pilgrim Senior Center, in Warwick, Sen Sheldon Whitehouse offered a different perspective to argue that the richest aren't overtaxed at all. "The IRS recently reported that the 400 biggest income earners in the country were making $334 million each, and were paying 16.6 percent in taxes," he said. According to an account of the meeting in The Warwick Beacon, Whitehouse went on to say that, most people wouldn’t have a tax rate that low unless their income was $28,100 or below. "A hospital orderly making $29,000 a year is therefore paying a higher rate of taxes on their income than someone making $344 million," the Beacon quoted Whitehouse as saying. We decided to check elements of both statements -- the rate the rich paid and the lower income level that would trigger a similar rate. When we asked Whitehouse's staff for the source of the 16.6 percent figure, they sent us to an IRS website that has statistics on the tax returns of the 400 individual taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross incomes. The most recent tax year available is 2007. (According to a transcript provided to us by the Whitehouse staff, the senator actually said he thought the report was from 2009.) One other clarification is important. The IRS is reporting on the top 400 individual tax returns, which could include a couple filing jointly. The IRS report says that, in 2007, the average adjusted gross income for the top 400 returns was $344 million. The average income tax paid per return was $57 million -- an average of 16.6 percent, as Whitehouse said. So on that point, he was right. Out of curiosity, members of PolitiFact Rhode Island checked our returns for 2007. We found that our tax rates were even lower than 16.6 percent, and we make a lot more than Whitehouse's hypothetical $29,000-a-year hospital orderly. So we checked Whitehouse's example, using tax rates, standard deductions and personal exemptions for both 2007 and 2010. We discovered that Whitehouse was off -- way off. That unmarried orderly filing a simple single return would be taxed at a rate of 9.1 percent in 2007 and 8.7 percent in 2010, not more than 16.6. Then, using IRS tax tables and schedules, we did some math to determine how much income a single person filing the simplest tax return would need before his tax rate exceeded that of the richest Americans. To hit a tax rate of 16.6 percent, that orderly would need to have made about $68,750 in 2007 and $73,500 in 2010, we calculated. When we showed our numbers to Whitehouse's staff, they said our results were misleading because we failed to include taxes for Medicare (1.45 percent) and Social Security (6.2 percent on the first $106,000 of income). "The vast majority of the income of the 400 wealthiest Americans is not subject to payroll taxes, whereas a worker with annual income around $29,000 would have to pay payroll taxes on all of their income," a statement from Whitehouse’s office said. "Leaving this data out of any comparison will paint a very uneven picture of the total taxes paid by working-class Americans." Although IRS spokeswoman Peggy Riley said those taxes are not factored into the IRS analysis, we understand the point of including them because the Social Security tax, in particular, has a significant impact on low- and middle-income people. According to calculations by Whitehouse’s office -- which match our own -- when you include Social Security and Medicare taxes, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 Americans would have been 16.72 percent in 2007; the tax rate for a worker earning $29,000 a year would have been 16.79 percent. In short, Whitehouse accurately reported the IRS's most recent summary of its top 400 tax filers, even if he incorrectly cited the year of the report. When we audited his suggestion that the super-rich pay a lower rate than someone making just $29,000, we concluded he's right if you include all payroll taxes, but off by about $40,000 if you only consider income tax, as the IRS report does. We rate his statement as Mostly True.	None	Sheldon Whitehouse	None	None	None	2011-02-25T00:00:01	2011-02-13	['None']
pomt-05142	"Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD properties in U.S. are illegals."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/21/facebook-posts/facebook-post-60-percent-public-housing/	One of the strongest charges aimed at illegal immigrants is that not only have they broken the law, but they are relying heavily on government handouts. A PolitiFact reader sent us a link to a Facebook post that lists many such claims of unlawful residents benefiting from federal programs. Among them was the claim that, "Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD housing in U.S. are illegals." The post went up on June 10 and since then has been shared over 3,900 times. To assess this statement, we looked at the total number of people using HUD subsidized housing. According to HUD’s website, the count was about 9.6 million in 2009, the most recent year for which they have data. That includes public housing, rent vouchers, Section 8 and a couple of other programs. If the 60 percent claim were accurate, then there would be about 5.8 million illegal immigrants living in HUD properties. There are about 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States according to a 2010 Pew Hispanic Center estimate. "It seems implausible on its face," says Chris Herbert, Research Director at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. "It would mean that about half of all the illegal immigrants in the country lived in assisted housing." If the practice were so widespread, Herbert says, it would come up often -- and he’s never heard any discussion of it. We checked with another of the country’s leading housing policy groups, the Furman Center For Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University, and they too drew a blank. We asked HUD ourselves. A spokesman could find no published report on illegal immigrants in HUD housing. HUD does require information on citizenship when people apply for assistance. Public housing and vouchers represent the bulk of HUD’s subsidized housing. The agency says 96 percent of those residents are citizens and about 4 percent are legal immigrants. "The claim that 60 percent are illegal is certainly nonsensical," says Brian Sullivan, a HUD spokesman. Applicants for subsidized housing must be citizens or legal immigrants. Sullivan notes that undocumented immigrants are allowed to live in subsidized housing if at least one member of the household is in the country legally. Typically, this happens when undocumented parents have a child in the U.S. Anyone born here is automatically a citizen and the parents could then rent in a HUD-subsidized property. In these cases, HUD reduces the subsidy for each undocumented person in the unit. Sullivan says, "The taxpayer would not be on the hook for assisting in their housing." We found one article that references an estimate of the number of illegal immigrants living in subsidized units. An item from the Associated Press says HUD pegged the number at about 30,000. That would be about 0.3 percent of all HUD residents -- a tiny fraction of 60 percent. An unconfirmed blog post in circulation on the Web mentions that Arizona HUD officials estimated that perhaps 10 percent of its occupants are in the country illegally. To be complete, we should note that whatever housing benefits an illegal immigrant might enjoy -- such as being allowed to live in a HUD unit because a family member is a citizen -- those benefits don’t count in certain kinds of deportation hearings. The government can deport someone if it determines they are a "public charge" which is defined as someone who is "primarily dependent on the Government for subsistence." HUD housing is not part of that calculation. Clearly, there are some illegal immigrants living in HUD housing and there are rules that might allow them to stay, but in no way do the numbers match the claim that 60 percent of HUD housing residents are "illegals." Our ruling The Facebook post says "Nearly 60% of all occupants of HUD housing in U.S. are illegals." The closest but unverified estimate we could find for illegal occupants in HUD housing is less than 1 percent nationwide. The claim of 60 percent is ridiculously false. Pants on Fire!

pomt-06079	Eliminating "Obamacare" ... "saves $95 billion a year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-repeats-claim-repealing-health-law-sav/	One of Mitt Romney’s favorite talking points is the need to shrink the federal government. The former Massachusetts governor says he will cut government spending and reduce taxes if elected president. Where would he start? With the national health reform plan signed by President Barack Obama in 2010. "The number one to cut is Obamacare. That saves $95 billion a year," Romney said in a primary debate in New Hampshire on Jan. 8, 2012. That savings figure is one he has cited before, and we found it to be incorrect. The national health care law leaves in place existing insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor while reducing the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to help those with modest incomes buy insurance. It includes an individual mandate, requiring almost every American to acquire insurance or pay a fine. And employers that don't offer health insurance to their employees will have to pay fines, with a few exceptions. For backup to his savings claim, Romney’s campaign cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the agency that independently calculates the cost of proposed laws. In February 2011, the CBO published an analysis of a Republican measure to fully repeal the health care law. The analysis was for H.R. 2, "the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act," a simple repeal bill that House Republicans approved on Jan. 19, 2011. On page 5 of that report, the CBO projected $95 billion less in outlays in 2016 if the law is repealed. But it’s important to note that repealing the health care law doesn’t only cut spending. The law had many moving parts, some of which were revenue sources to offset the spending and reduce the overall federal deficit. The law spent money on providing tax subsidies to help people buy insurance and by expanding Medicaid. But it offset those additional costs by slowing the growth of future spending on Medicare. And, it generated revenues by creating new excise taxes on high-cost health insurance plans (the "Cadillac" plans); adding new Medicare taxes on people with high incomes; and charging new fees to health insurance companies and health care manufacturers. In other words, fully repealing the law would also repeal mechanisms that reduce the deficit, such as cost reductions and higher taxes. When the CBO looked at the first 10 years of repeal, from 2012 to 2021, it found that repeal added $210 billion to the deficit. So the deficit would actually be lower if the law is not repealed. Our ruling Romney said repealing the health care law would save $95 billion a year. But that only accounts for outlays in one year, 2016. Because of the revenue sources that the law established, repealing it actually adds significantly to the deficit over the long haul, according to the CBO. We rate Romney’s statement False.

pomt-10815	"I'm probably one of the four or five best-known Americans in the world."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/24/rudy-giuliani/famous-but-not-that-famous/	Rudy Giuliani has been a world traveler since he ended his term as New York City mayor to become a security consultant. He says he's made 91 trips to 35 countries in the past five years. On a whirlwind tour of the United Kingdom recently, he met with Prime Minister Gordon Brown and schmoozed Ronald Reagan's old friend Margaret Thatcher. In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II gave him an honorary knighthood for his leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks. He must have been feeling particularly well-loved when he bragged to reporters in London that he was one of the "four or five" most famous Americans in the world. Reporters were quick to ask: Who else is on the list? "Bill Clinton … Hillary," Rudy began, before aides (wisely?) pulled him away. He might want to add those two guys from his own party: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. We know Giuliani is from New York, and if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere. But still … top five? In the world? We turned to the world of scientific polling. Polling the globe is a daunting proposition. But representatives of both the Gallup World Poll and the Pew Global Attitudes Project said they have never queried the world on who among us Americans is best known. We asked Giuliani's campaign staff, but they didn't offer anything to back up the claim. Opinionmakers across the Web guffawed at the notion that Giuliani ranks so high and were willing to offer other ideas. The New York Daily News suggested Brangelina, Madonna and Oprah Winfrey, among others. Wonkette, a political gossip blog, offered suggestions from George Washington to Michael Jackson. Chris Reed, a San Diego Union-Tribune blogger, said Colin Powell, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and slew of other celebs are more famous. (Fair warning: Reed calls his blog "America's Finest Blog.") We here at PolitiFact finally turned to an unscientific — but world-famous — measure of celebrity: Google hits. Here's what we found: "George W. Bush": 36.4-million hits "Oprah": 21.9-million hits "Tom Cruise": 10.1-million hits "Angelina Jolie": 9.9-million hits "Brad Pitt": 7.2-million hits "Hillary Clinton": 5.8-million hits "Bill Clinton": 5.8-million hits "Dick Cheney": 2.5-million hits "Arnold Schwarzenegger": 2.3-million hits "Rudy Giuliani": 2.1-million hits. That puts Giuliani at No. 10. And we didn't even include Madonna, because we couldn't figure out how to weed out the religious and artwork references. For all of the above reasons, we rate this claim "pants on fire."	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2007-09-24T00:00:00	2007-09-19	['United_States']
pomt-06269	Says she "brought together business, labor and hospitals to give 94,000 Oregon children health care."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/26/eileen-brady/how-big-role-did-eileen-brady-play-expanding-child/	In her bid to be Portland’s next mayor, Eileen Brady has been getting a lot of mileage out of her work on health care reform. Her campaign website calls her service on the Oregon Health Fund Board -- the board tasked with reworking the state’s system -- "perhaps Eileen’s most important public service role." That theme keeps popping up again and again. Most recently, we spotted it in a Facebook ad, which said "On the Oregon Health Fund Board, Eileen brought together business, labor and hospitals to give 94,000 Oregon children health care." She also brought the board up in her announcement speech back in early September. "In 2009 Governor Kulongoski appointed me as vice chair of the Oregon Health Fund Board ... Today, as the result of the work we did on that board and the Legislature’s commitment we were able to provide health insurance to an additional 94,000 kids," she said. "During this process I came to know insurance executives, hospital leaders, labor leaders, and activists. And I helped find the common ground that enabled us to put our differences aside and put our children first." We wondered whether the claim that she brought together these constituencies was true. Brady’s spokesman John Isaacs, happy to help us reach a True rating on this fact check, sent us a long list of folks to get in touch with who would be happy to vouch for her leadership skills. "I expect that you will call each of these people," he wrote. Not so surprisingly, they all gave Brady rave reviews. Tom Chamberlain, president of the AFL-CIO and a member of the board, said he and Brady pushed for a consensus-style committee process in which "we got input from everybody." Still, he said, "when Eileen and I presented that, I don't recall a lot of push back." As for the general idea that Brady helped build agreement between groups, Chamberlain said "that's fair to say," adding that as a vice chair of the committee, "she probably deserves a little more credit." "All of us worked really hard and all of us went to town-hall-like meetings all over the state," Chamberlain said. Brady, he said, carried her own weight and might have gone to more meetings than anybody else, though he couldn’t remember for certain. Next up was Alan Bates, a Democratic senator from Medford, and one of two authors of the bill that created the board on which Brady sat. After the committee had crafted their proposal, Bates said, he took Eileen with him to a meeting of the Senate’s Republican caucus. "Eileen stepped up as a business leader and on a very emotional and solid basis really sold them," he said. "Eileen was really germane to getting that done." Bates, it should be noted, has endorsed Brady. As has Jonathan Ater, who served as the other vice chair on the Oregon Health Fund Board. Naturally, then, Ater had good things to say about Brady. "I do not think the Legislature would have been able to adopt a children's health insurance program unless there had been a very substantial consensus built up," he said. "I think Eileen was a critical part of bridging that discussion." The difficult thing with a statement like this is that we can’t base a ruling off personal accounts alone -- particularly personal accounts from supporters. It’s also hard to parse out exactly how essential any one person was. What we can do, though, is offer some context. The road to health care reform in Oregon has been a pretty twisty one, involving hundreds of people and meetings over the course of many years. The specific change that Brady touts on Facebook and in her speech has roots stretching back several years. In June 2007, Sen. Bates and Sen. Ben Westlund, D-Bend, manged to get the Healthy Oregon Act through the state Legislature. That act, the product of an 18-month effort that included hearings across Oregon, set "essential health care benefits for all Oregonians." It also allocated money for creating a seven-member Oregon Health Fund Board, which would turn the concepts outlined in the legislation into a workable plan. Brady was appointed to that board. After more than a year’s worth of work and dozens of meetings, the board presented then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski with a fleshed-out plan. The Oregonian reported at the time that "the panel crafted its plan during the past year with volunteer committee help from doctors, hospitals, insurers and others in the health care industry and testimony from more than 1,000 Oregonians across the state." Included in that plan was a recommendation for a 1 percent tax on hospitals and health insurance providers to increase the number of children and low-income adults on the Oregon Health Plan. The Legislature approved the legislation in 2009 and children have been enrolling since. Given the long and involved history, it would be an overstatement to say that Brady was so integral to all of this that it wouldn’t have happened without her. That said, her position as vice chair of the board that ultimately suggested the provider tax to expand children’s health care is nothing to sneeze at. The board had to balance the needs and desires of several constituencies and Brady was one of the leaders during those talks. The history, stretching back to when Bates and Westlund first traveled the state to put together their initial act, is important additional information, but the comment that Brady "helped find the common ground" can’t really be disputed. We find this one Mostly True. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.	None	Eileen Brady	None	None	None	2011-11-26T07:45:36	2011-11-15	['Oregon']
pomt-09323	"A filibuster has never really been successfully used against a Supreme Court justice."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/14/jeffrey-toobin/toobin-says-supreme-court-nominee-has-never-been-f/	The announcement by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens that he plans to retire later this year has raised the curtain on a new confirmation battle -- and with it the possibility of a Republican filibuster of President Barack Obama's nominee to succeed the long-serving justice. In public comments, key Republican senators have been carefully noncommittal about how far they'll go. Against this backdrop, legal affairs analyst Jeffrey Toobin told Stephen Colbert on the April 12, 2010, edition of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report that "a filibuster has never really been successfully used against a Supreme Court justice." We decided to check the history books to see if that was true. There's little question that filibusters against a Supreme Court nomination are unusual. But we did find one example that would seem to fit Toobin's description: President Lyndon B. Johnson's attempt to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice in 1968. In June 1968 -- just five months before the election to succeed Johnson -- then-Chief Justice Earl Warren told the president that he planned to retire soon. Fearing a victory by Republican Richard Nixon in the November election, Johnson, a Democrat, acted quickly to nominate a successor to the liberal chief justice. The president chose Fortas, a longtime friend. Many members of the Republican minority, joined by some conservative Southern Democrats, mobilized against the Fortas nomination for a variety of reasons, including his liberal record, his "crony"-like ties to Johnson, and the hope that Nixon would win and appoint someone else. Initially, it looked like Fortas' nomination would squeak by the Senate. But he hemorrhaged support after revelations that he'd attended White House staff meetings as a sitting justice, informed the president about secret Supreme Court deliberations and been paid for a series of lectures at American University by a collection of private-sector interests whose business could come before the court. When Fortas' nomination went to the floor on Sept. 24, it wasn't clear whether he had the votes to be confirmed. Some news accounts at the time described the opposition as a filibuster. For a 2005 Washington Post article that looked back on the confirmation battle, congressional reporter Charles Babington tracked down some of the original coverage and found a page-one story in the Post that declared, "Fortas Debate Opens with a Filibuster." It went on to describe the day's actions as a "full-dress Republican-led filibuster." Meanwhile, the New York Times said that Fortas' opponents "began a historic filibuster today." Under Senate rules at the time, breaking through a filibuster and proceeding to an up-or-down vote -- a process called securing cloture -- required the votes of 67 senators, assuming that all 100 senators were present and voting. (That number was later reduced to 60, where it stands today.) On Oct. 1, following four days of debate, the Senate held a cloture vote. The final tally was 45 senators in favor of cloture and 43 against -- well short of the 59 required to proceed to a final vote, given that only 88 senators were present and voting. Seeing the writing on the wall, Johnson -- a master of Senate strategy from his tenure as majority leader -- withdrew Fortas' nomination for chief justice. Sure sounds like a filibuster, right? Yes, but there are some nuances. During a partisan conflict in the mid 2000s about judicial filibusters, Republicans argued that the Fortas case -- then being used as a frequent Democratic talking point -- wasn't really a filibuster after all. C. Boyden Gray, former chief counsel to President George H.W. Bush, wrote in a 2003 op-ed that "four days of debate on a nomination for chief justice is hardly a filibuster." He cited the closing floor speech of none other than Sen. Robert Griffin, R-Mich., the leader of the fight against Fortas. Griffin asked, "When is a filibuster, Mr. President? ... There have been no dilatory quorum calls or other dilatory tactics employed. The speakers who have taken the floor have addressed themselves to the subject before the Senate, and a most interesting and useful discussion has been recorded in the Congressional Record." Griffin reportedly wrote a letter in 2003 reiterating his belief that he and his allies had not engaged in a filibuster. A 2002 report by the Congressional Research Service -- the authoritative, nonpartisan research arm of Congress -- provides a bit of support for this argument, noting that the mere fact that a cloture vote has been taken does not necessarily prove that an actual filibuster was under way. "Supporters of a nomination may move for cloture, in order to speed action, even when opponents may not consider themselves to be conducting a filibuster against it, or when they may have only threatened, but not actually conducted, a filibuster," the report says. "Since filibusters may be conducted through a variety of tactics, there are no specific actions that definitively indicate the occurrence of a filibuster, much less of a mere threat to filibuster." That said, CRS didn't say it wasn't a filibuster, either. And many scholars agree with the press coverage at the time that Fortas' opponents did, at the very least, threaten a filibuster, and quite likely undertook one outright. "It was understood as a filibuster at the time," Laura Kalman, a professor of history at the University of California at Santa Barbara and author of Abe Fortas: A Biography, told MSNBC in 2005, adding that "both Abe Fortas and LBJ are spinning in their graves at the notion there was no filibuster." Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a 2004 column that saying the opposition didn't really filibuster "is like arguing, 'Yes, I shot him, but I can’t be charged with murder because he would have died of cancer anyhow.'" In an interview for this article, Ornstein acknowledged that the peculiarities of the Fortas episode do suggest that it merits "an asterisk," but he added that he still believes it's accurate to call it "a successful filibuster." The official guardians of Senate history don't mince words. The Senate Historical Office's Web site headlines its recap of the nomination fight, "Filibuster Derails Supreme Court Appointment." In an interview, Senate historian Donald Ritchie said that the term "filibuster is a matter of definition, and Boyden Gray, as an attorney, was defining it to suit the purposes of his client. Historians and political scientists would define it differently." Let's return to Toobin's statement. We'll acknowledge that there's some debate about whether Fortas' opponents in 1968 officially launched a filibuster. But as CRS points out, there's no magic test to determine whether a filibuster has actually occurred. Meanwhile, news accounts from the time describe it as a filibuster, and a variety of scholars agree that Fortas' opponents at the very least used the implied threat of a filibuster as leverage. So we rate Toobin's statement False.	None	Jeffrey Toobin	None	None	None	2010-04-14T19:55:41	2010-04-12	['None']
pomt-04025	Says that 9 million to 50 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/feb/01/texas-federation-republican-women/republican-group-says-9-million-50-million-illegal/	A Texas group urging congressional action on immigration also says the number of illegal U.S. residents might vary more than five-fold. The Texas Federation of Republican Women, which describes itself as the state’s most powerful women’s political group, said in its Jan. 17, 2013, resolution: "Within the United States, there currently reside between nine (9) and fifty (50) million undocumented residents from all cultural and socio-economic backgrounds and nationalities." That’s some range. The 9 million figure undershoots a widely bandied estimate of 11 million, most recently included in December 2012 news accounts from USA Today and the Associated Press. The 50 million figure seems off the charts. And the full statement indicates that 3 percent to 16 percent of more than 315 million U.S. residents are here illegally. To our inquiries, a federation spokeswoman, Laura Sorrell of Austin, said the group drew its figures from different sources. She said by email that the group had no source to provide for the 9 million figure, while the 50 million figure was provided by a former fellow with Rice University’s James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy, Joan Neuhaus Schaan. The 50 million methodology By phone, Schaan told us she reached her estimate, which she said she has not laid out in a research presentation, by assuming that annual apprehensions of border crossers represent about 10 percent of actual crossers, an assumption she said she based on years of speaking engagements, including many in the Texas-Mexico border region. Border region "landowners, local law enforcement, those living the reality of human migration, would say that maybe 3 percent of those people that crossed were being apprehended," Schaan said. "In some cases, thousands of people a week are crossing properties with virtually no apprehensions." Schaan was referring to apprehensions by the Border Patrol, part of the Department of Homeland Security, which reported in July 2011 that the number of apprehensions declined 61 percent from nearly 1.2 million in 2005 to 463,000 in 2010, with the vast majority of them occurring along the southwest border near Mexico. The 2010 total was the lowest level since 1972; peaks in apprehensions, of early 1.7 million, were reached in 1986 and 2000, it says. Yet the report cautions against presuming that apprehensions relate to a particular number of individuals. "Apprehension data... represent events, not individuals," it says. "The total number of apprehensions during a specific period will be greater than the total number of unique individuals apprehended because some individuals will have been apprehended more than once. The relationship between the number of border apprehensions to either the number of attempted illegal entries or the number of successful illegal entries is unknown." Other estimates To take our own look, we turned to several oft-quoted sources, each one lately suggesting there are 11 million to 13 million illegal U.S. residents. According to a March 2012 Department of Homeland Security report, there were 11.5 million illegal immigrants living in the country in January 2011, about the same number as in 2010, and a little more than half of the 22 million legal foreign-born residents in the country. Some history: The United States was home to up to 4 million illegal residents in 1980, the report says, with the number peaking at 11.8 million in 2007. The report, drawing from U.S. Census Bureau household surveys and Homeland Security figures, says some 55 percent of the unauthorized residents entered the country between 1995 and 2004, with entrants since 2005 accounting for 14 percent of the illegal 2011 residents. "It is unlikely that the unauthorized immigrant population increased after 2007," the report says, "given relatively high U.S. unemployment, improved economic conditions in Mexico, record low numbers of apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants at U.S. borders, and greater levels of border enforcement." The report says 59 percent of the country’s unauthorized immigrants in 2011, some 6.8 million, were from Mexico, with 2.8 million living in California, 1.8 million in Texas. More recently, the Pew Hispanic Center said in December 2012 that 11.1 million unauthorized residents lived in the country as of March 2011, "unchanged from the previous two years and a continuation of the sharp decline in this population since its peak in 2007," the center said, when the number of illegal immigrants in the United States peaked at 12 million. Both Homeland Security and the Pew center devised their estimates by drawing on the census surveys and applying a "residual" method of calculation. "Under this methodology," Pew wrote, "a demographic estimate of the legal foreign-born population — naturalized citizens, legal permanent residents, temporary legal residents and refugees — is subtracted from the total foreign-born population. The remainder, or residual, is the source of population estimates and characteristics of unauthorized immigrants." The Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, said it took a similar approach to conclude in an August 2012 report that there were 10.5 million illegal immigrants in the country in 2010, though it said that after adjustments of undercounting of the population by the U.S, Census Bureau the total could have been 11.5 million or more. Most "research indicates that roughly 10 percent of illegals are not counted in Census Bureau surveys," the report says, meaning the "true size of the illegal population could be 11.5 million. If the undercount is larger, then the total illegal alien population is larger." By email, the center’s research director, Steve Camarota, said there could be 13 million illegal residents in the country. He said, though, that he doesn’t see how administrative records such as births or school enrollments would justify any conclusion that such estimates are off by huge margins. "There is uncertainty in the numbers," Camarota said. "But not that big." We also touched base with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which says its mission is to educate Americans about the costs of immigration, particularly illegal immigration. A spokesman, Jack Martin, said by phone that the group has taken up the estimates by Homeland Security, the Pew Hispanic Center and the Center for Immigration Studies and made adjustments for what it believes to be some untallied residents. He said FAIR believes there are 11.9 million illegal residents. Weaknesses in 50 million figure We asked Martin for his thoughts on the topmost figure in the Texas group’s resolution, 50 million. He said there is no logical basis for such an elevated estimate, though similar errors were made in the past when observers incorrectly counted each government apprehension of an illegal immigrant as an immigrant — even if the same person was apprehended by authorities a dozen times in a matter of weeks or over a year. Worse, he said, some observers erred by adding each year’s apprehensions to the tally for each subsequent year, inaccurately describing the ballooning total as a count of illegal immigrants in the country at that time. Similarly, Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, said it’s a mistake to convert the number of Border Patrol apprehensions into a count of individuals living in the country. Aside from noting the same weakness identified by Martin, Passel said by phone that given that most apprehensions involve men, relating total apprehensions to the number of illegal residents in the country would erroneously signal that Mexico is overrun with women alone. Also not factored in, Passel said, is the fact that many illegal residents travel, staying in the U.S. for a few months at a time or less. Schaan’s methodology "has no validity," Passel said. Finally, Martin also sounded a general cautionary note about pinning down the number of illegal residents. "Any estimate is simply an estimate," he said. Schaan stuck by her figure, emailing: "Clearly we have a difference of opinion on the approximate number, and any research group will be compelled to support their own positions and downplay anything different. There is no question in my mind the 11 million to 13 million figure is low, but there is no way to prove it one way or the other." Sorrell, of the federation, told us by email that the point of its resolution was to not get bogged down with the numbers, but to prove a point that no one knows what the actual numbers are. Our ruling The federation said there are 9 million to 50 million illegal U.S. residents. At a glance, that’s almost certainly right, though one could similarly say there are zero to 100 million. Too vast a range is misleading. It’s also fair to concede that no one knows the precise number of illegal residents. However, accepted estimates, tied to household surveys and other research, suggest that the likely range tops out at 12 million or so, only one quarter of the federation’s unsupported top-end 50 million figure. We rate this claim as Mostly False.	None	Texas Federation of Republican Women	None	None	None	2013-02-01T15:25:36	2013-01-17	['United_States']
pomt-15178	"There are actually only 30 countries that practice birthright citizenship."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/23/se-cupp/se-cupp-only-about-30-other-countries-offer-birthr/	The country’s 150-year-old right of citizenship to every person upon birth on U.S. soil has become the latest test question for GOP presidential candidates, with Donald Trump and Ben Carson coming out strongly in favor of ending the practice. In an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union, conservative pundit S.E. Cupp suggested the United States’ law makes it an outlier on the issue compared to the rest of the world. "There are actually only 30 countries that practice birthright citizenship," she said on the Aug. 23, 2015, show, "making the U.S. kind of an anomaly." We wanted to see if the United States is one of 30 countries in the world to offer automatic citizenship to anyone born on its soil. We reached out to Cupp through her publicist but did not hear back. Around the world The legal term for birthright citizenship is jus soli, or "right of the soil." It’s different from the term jus sanguinis, or "right of blood," referring to laws which rely on a person’s heritage to determine his or her citizenship status. Birthright citizenship in the United States was first made law by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, primarily to grant legal status to emancipated slaves. The amendment stipulates that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." The Supreme Court solidified the Constitution’s authority on this issue in 1898 by ruling that citizenship is a right offered unconditionally to all born on U.S. soil. How many other countries share this guarantee? NumbersUSA, a group that favors reduced immigration, compiled a list that shows 33 nations grant citizenship to anyone born within their borders. The United States is joined by Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, along with nearly every country in Central and South America. The United States and Canada are the only two "developed" countries, as defined by the International Monetary Fund, that still have unrestricted birthright citizenship laws. A closer look at the list shows an interesting trend: Countries that offer birthright citizenship are located almost exclusively in the Western Hemisphere. No country in Europe or East Asia, for example, has a similar citizenship policy. So why does birthright citizenship literally divide the world? One explanation may be colonialism, said John Skrentny, a sociologist at the University of California, San Diego. As European countries colonized the Americas, Skrentny said, many created lenient naturalization laws in order to grow and overpower native populations. "Getting people to move in was a good way to establish authority," he said. This method of citizenship hasn’t changed that much in the centuries since. Many of the birthright laws in South America have remained due to low immigration numbers, he said. The United States, however, has retained its birthright citizenship laws, even as it admits around 1 million people every year through its legal immigration system. Canada, which also has a birthright citizenship law, still takes in around 250,000 legal immigrants a year. Conversely, in Europe, many countries have modified their requirements for citizenship in recent years. Ireland got rid of its birthright citizenship law in 2005, and France did away with its own in 1993. Many European countries still maintain a version of birthright citizenship, however. In Germany and the United Kingdom, citizenship is now automatically granted to a person if at least one of his or her parents is a citizen or permanent resident. Our ruling Cupp said, "There are actually only 30 countries that practice birthright citizenship, making the U.S. kind of an anomaly." The United States is one of 33 countries around the world that offer citizenship to every person born on their soil. Among those 33, the United States admits the highest number of immigrants per year. In contrast, most other developed countries have added more requirements for citizenship. This makes the United States somewhat of an outlier on the issue. We rate Cupp’s statement True. Clarification: Among the 33 countries with birthright citizenship, the United States admits the highest number of immigrants per year. An earlier version of this story was unclear.	None	S.E.

pomt-01968	All 28 members of NATO have "pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/19/paul-ryan/only-3-natos-28-members-spend-what-they-promised-d/	Two days before President Barack Obama announced he would consider military options for halting a violent Islamic insurgency in Iraq, former vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan gave a speech on foreign policy. The Wisconsin Republican and House Budget Committee chairman, known primarily for his work on domestic issues, argued for a buildup of the U.S. military. And he suggested that America’s allies need to do more. Speaking June 11, 2014 at a Center for a New American Security conference in Washington, D.C., Ryan said that "the fight against terrorism is global in scope. And we can’t fight it alone. We need partners." He added: "We have to work better with all of our allies, all around the world. In Western Europe, we have to strike a balance. Our friends can’t depend on us for all of their defense needs and we can’t dictate to them all of their defense policies. Every member of NATO has pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us." NATO has 28 members. With tensions rising in Iraq, the Ukraine and elsewhere, is it true that only three NATO countries spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense? NATO's evolution The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949, largely to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. There were 12 founding members, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The new allies agreed that "an armed attack against one or more of them … shall be considered an attack against them all" and that following such an attack, each would take "such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force." From 2004 through 2011, NATO provided training in Iraq, helping the country develop its armed forces. More recently there has been a focus on the Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. About a week before Ryan gave his speech, NATO's top official said the alliance would finalize a package to modernize Ukraine's armed forces following Russia's annexation of the ex-Soviet republic's Crimea territory. The alliance is heavily dependent on the United States. According to NATO’s latest annual report, for 2013, U.S. defense expenditures accounted for nearly three-fourths of all NATO member defense expenditures: United States -- 73 percent United Kingdom -- 6.6 percent France -- 4.9 percent Germany -- 4.7 percent Since 2007, the U.S. share has increased, from 68 percent, while the overall share from European members has decreased. Ryan’s claim To back Ryan’s claim, his office cited the 2013 annual report. It notes that NATO members "have collectively agreed to two guidelines to help encourage an equitable sharing of roles, risks and responsibilities." One of the guidelines, or goals, as the report also calls it, is that members "should devote at least 2 percent of gross domestic product to defense." Only the United States, the United Kingdom and Greece met the 2 percent goal in 2013, the report says. But newer NATO figures, released in February 2014, show that a fourth member -- Estonia -- also met the 2 percent benchmark: NATO member Amount spent on defense Percentage of gross domestic product spent on defense United States $735.2 billion 4.4 United Kingdom $60.3 billion 2.4 Greece $5.67 billion 2.3 Estonia $479 million 2 The day before Ryan gave his speech, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called for European allies to increase their defense spending, noting that since Estonia had met the 2 percent goal, he expected other nations could also do so. The fact that only four NATO members had met that mark had also been noted previously by news media including the New York Times and Reuters. Our rating Ryan said all 28 members of NATO have "pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their economy on defense. But only three countries do -- Britain, Greece and us." Ryan neglected to count a fourth member, Estonia. But that oversight doesn’t negate his larger point, which is that few NATO countries meet the 2 percent benchmark. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06119	"And, as of today, New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/29/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-new-jersey-has-fewer-state-e/	Private-sector jobs in New Jersey may be on the rise, but the number of state government employees is lower than it was nearly 11 years ago. During a Dec. 20 interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, pointed to that statistic and other achievements as examples of what he’s been able to accomplish in the face of a Democratic-controlled Legislature. "And, as of today, New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001," Christie told hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. "So, we’ve made government smaller. We’ve made it smarter. We’ve made it less expensive for people. And we’ve done that with a Democratic Legislature." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie’s numbers are solid. Based on the latest preliminary statistics from state and federal officials, the number of "state government" workers dropped to 137,800 in November, which represents 600 fewer employees than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman resigned in January 2001. Let’s break down the figures. When Whitman stepped down to become head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, there were 138,400 state workers, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. By the time Christie took office in January 2010, the number of state government employees had increased to 151,900, marking a jump of nearly 10 percent since January 2001. As of November of this year, the number of state workers had fallen during Christie’s tenure by 14,100, or about 9.3 percent. When compared to Whitman’s final month in office, the decline is a more modest 0.4 percent, or 600 workers, but nevertheless, it’s still a reduction. Those statistics include workers in state departments; the legislative and judicial branches; state colleges and universities; state hospitals and state authorities and commissions, such as NJ Transit. But these figures don’t account for public employees in municipal and county governments, and local school districts. Between the executive, legislative and judicial branches, the number of state employees has dropped by about 4,738 from when Christie took office to November, state officials said. Most of the staff reductions have been due to retirements, with only 743 positions eliminated through layoffs, officials said. "As to attrition, there has been a concerted effort by the administration to shrink the size of state government, which had grown too large and costly. At the same time, the Governor has insisted that departments be efficient and effective in the delivery of services," Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an email. "As we all know as well by now, fiscal realities have required painful budgeting decisions at the same time." The wave of retirements comes at a time when state officials have been demanding greater contributions from public-sector workers toward their benefits. Hetty Rosenstein, state director of the Communication Workers of America, the largest union representing state workers, attributed the retirements to employees’ concerns over benefits and the age of the workforce The reduction began with hiring freezes under former Gov. Jon Corzine, Rosenstein said. "It is an aging workforce," Rosenstein said. "This is essentially attrition....This is all to be expected." Rutgers labor professor Jeff Keefe also said a "great deal of anxiety about benefits" is driving the retirements. When Christie took office, most public workers got the message that the state was facing significant long-term fiscal problems, Keefe said. Our ruling In a television interview, Christie claimed "New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001." The governor’s right, according to the latest preliminary labor statistics. By November, there were 600 fewer state workers than when Whitman stepped down in January 2001. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12784	Recent immigration raids "are not business as usual. The raids are being done indiscriminately. They’re not focused simply on criminal aliens."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/17/robert-menendez/sen-bob-menendez-says-immigration-raids-not-busine/	Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez says recent sweeps by federal authorities of immigrants living in the country illegally are "striking fear" in immigrant communities because they have not been limited to criminals, a category President Donald Trump labeled as his top priority. "The raids are not business as usual. The raids are being done indiscriminately. They’re not focused simply on criminal aliens," the senator from New Jersey said in a video posted on his Twitter account Feb. 13. "And because the administration eliminated the Obama administration’s enforcement priorities — where the first and top enforcement were criminal aliens to be deported, then secondly recent border crossers, and then the third and final tier was anybody else — because they did away with that enforcement priority list, now anyone who they come upon who may be undocumented ultimately gets picked up and sent away." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump campaigned on promises to deport immigrants illegally in the country, prioritizing the removal of those who have been convicted of crimes or pose threats to national security, such as drug dealers and murderers. Is Menendez accurate in claiming that recent immigration sweeps are not business as usual and include people without criminal convictions? We found that recent operations are routine, but they also included arrests of individuals who would not have been a high priority under former President Barack Obama’s administration. Trump’s executive order prioritizing removals Less than a week after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that directed the secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize for removal a broad range of people, including individuals convicted of crimes "involving moral turpitude" (such as murder); engaged in terrorist activities; convicted of any criminal offense; charged with any criminal offense, even if the charge has not been resolved; with final orders of removal; and individuals who commit acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense. Trump’s priorities "sweep far more broadly," and "do not set up an internal hierarchy to indicate which categories should be emphasized when resources are short — as they always are," said David A. Martin, a professor of law emeritus at the University of Virginia and immigration expert, in an analysis for Vox. The executive order basically takes the broadest possible definition of "criminal alien," said Martin, a former principal deputy general counsel at DHS, in an interview with PolitiFact. In the later years of Obama’s administration, the top priority for removal were threats to national security, border security, and public safety; ranked as a second priority were individuals convicted of misdemeanors, recent immigration law violators and individuals who had "significantly abused" visa programs; the lowest priority were individuals who had been issued a final order for removal on or after Jan. 1, 2014. Prior to outlining those priorities in November 2014, Obama was labeled by immigrants’ rights activists as "Deporter-in-Chief" because his administration had deported more than 2 million people. ICE targeted operations across the country In the early days of the Trump administration, elected officials and media outlets have reported that hundreds of immigrants were arrested in cities across America, including people who immigrant rights advocates say don’t fit Trump’s prominent descriptions of public safety threats. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement Feb. 13 that said an agency within his department, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, last week conducted a series of targeted enforcement operations in multiple cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta, which led to the arrest of more than 680 people. About 75 percent of them had been convicted of crimes that included but were not limited to homicide, aggravated sexual abuse and drug trafficking, the statement said. The operations also targeted "individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws, including those who illegally re-entered the country after being removed and immigration fugitives ordered removed by federal immigration judges," Kelly said. The targeted operations have been common practice for many years, he said. An ICE spokeswoman provided PolitiFact fact sheets for targeted operations in recent days and also highlighted previous operations under the Obama administration that focused on arresting criminals living in the country illegally. A December 2012 Congressional Research Service report on interior immigration enforcement said ICE’s National Fugitive Operations Program targets included at-large criminal aliens and "fugitive aliens who have not been convicted of a crime." As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker noted, fugitive operations in fiscal year 2010 (Obama’s first full fiscal year) led to 35,774 arrests. In fiscal 2011, there were 39,466 arrests. Still, Menendez’s office pointed to parts of Kelly’s statement that said 75 percent -- not 100 percent -- of those arrested were criminal aliens and to the line saying that among the arrested were individuals who had violated immigration laws. To further contrast Trump and Obama’s policies, the senator’s team also referenced a recent deportee, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos. The 35-year-old woman had been living in Arizona and had a deportation order, but instead of removing her from the country, the Obama administration required her to check in periodically as they focused on deporting violent criminals, the New York Times reported. She was arrested during her last check-in with ICE and deported Feb. 9. ICE said they removed Garcia de Rayos because she had a felony conviction and a deportation order. The Mexican national had used a fake Social Security number for employment and pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal impersonation, a Class 6 felony, according to the Washington Post. A day after Menendez’s claim that recent immigration sweeps "are not business as usual," Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in an MSNBC interview Feb. 14 said he had been told by ICE that there were people arrested who had no other violation besides being in the country unlawfully. "But some of them were caught up wrong place, wrong time. They're going after somebody, somebody else was in the apartment and they got taken up," Garcetti said. On Feb. 15, Reuters reported that a 23-year-old Mexican man, Daniel Ramirez Medina, who had been granted deferred deportation protection during the Obama administration was detained by immigration authorities Feb. 10 in Washington state. ICE told Reuters that Ramirez was arrested "based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety." Ramirez’s lawyers told the news agency he had been pressured by ICE agents "to falsely admit affiliation." Ramirez’s detention was not connected to the recent targeted enforcement actions, ICE said. He was arrested when officers went to a home to take into custody another person, a previously deported convicted felon. Our ruling Menendez said that recent immigration raids "are not business as usual. The raids are being done indiscriminately. They’re not focused simply on criminal aliens." Deportations are being conducted on a broader basis than before. But his statement gives the impression that there are widespread deportations of law-abiding people. For the most part, deportations are still focused on people who committed other crimes. Menendez’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. Overall, we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2bebb6ca-9052-404a-a8b1-fd006c70c1cb	None	Robert Menendez	None	None	None	2017-02-17T15:41:37	2017-02-13	['None']
pomt-03680	"Women in Ohio earn on average 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/24/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-cites-wage-gap-between-ohio-women/	Wedged between April Fools Day and the April 15 tax filing deadline is a lesser- known April milestone that feminist and labor groups, the U.S. Department of Labor and the White House are eager to publicize. By their reckoning, April 9 is the day when female wage earners catch up to the amount of money their higher-earning male counterparts collected during the previous year. They refer to it as Equal Pay Day. Numerous politicians noted the occasion this year by issuing press releases. President Obama issued a presidential proclamation. Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge decried earnings disparities on her Facebook page, where she cited an analysis of the wage gap produced by the National Partnership on Women and Families and a study by the American Association of University Women in saying: "Women in Ohio earn on average 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man." Fudge accurately relayed the data released by those groups, but how accurate was their material? Data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which the groups relied on, show the 77 percent pay gap percent figure they cited, but an October 2012 report on women’s earnings from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated a smaller wage gap for Ohio: 83.6 percent. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the varied pay gap assessments are due to differences in how each agency conducts its measurements. The Census Bureau and women’s groups look at differences in annual earnings, while the BLS examines earnings on a weekly basis. "Analyzing the weekly figures can be more precise in certain ways, like accounting for work hours that vary over the course of the year, and less accurate in others, like certain forms of compensation that don’t get paid as weekly wages," the Labor Department said last year in a blog entry on the pay gap. "No matter which number you start with, the differences in pay for women and men really add up. " The National Partnership for Women and Families decided to use Census Bureau material in examining the annual median earnings for full-time, year-round workers because "it has the longest history and it is the most frequently cited data," according to the group‘s director of workplace fairness, Sarah Crawford. Crawford said BLS’ weekly earnings data includes some workers who work full-time, but not all year, excludes the self-employed, and also underestimates earnings from yearly bonuses. PolitiFact has made several examinations of the claim that women earn 76 to 77 percent as much as men, and found that they lacked context because they failed to account for factors like education, type of job, age of employee and experience level. For example, an October study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equality for women and girls, analyzed men’s and women’s salaries a year after graduation from college. It found a wage gap in almost all occupations, but concluded it was a smaller 6.6 percent when qualifiers like education, training, age, and parental status were taken into account. That gap could be attributed to gender discrimination and women’ ability to negotiate salaries, the report found .An AAAU researcher noted the wage gap can grow as careers progress. Fudge is right that there’s a gap in pay between men and women, though the size of that gap depends on the statistics one consults. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-05579	Says Ohio Treasurer Josh "Mandel first claimed bank fraud in June 2010 but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his (Republican) Senate campaign."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/03/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-josh-mandel-accused-ban/	Ohio Democrats have turned state Treasurer Josh Mandel into their favorite punching bag. They question the GOP Senate candidate’s ambition, his work ethic and his truthfulness. Now the Ohio Democratic Party and Sen. Sherrod Brown’s campaign are questioning Mandel’s integrity. Mandel announced last month that his office was cutting ties with two banks he suspects of fraud. His opponents pounced. Justin Barasky, a spokesman for Brown and former state party press secretary, emailed that Mandel had raised questions about fraud while campaigning for the treasurer’s post nearly two years ago. "Why," Barasky wondered, "did Mandel not lead the way by acting against the banks as soon as he took office?" An email from the state party had similar language but was much more direct. The missive was loaded with pointed accusations that Mandel allowed "alleged fraud" to occur and suggestions that he acted only when it became politically convenient to do so. PolitiFact Ohio decided to home in on the overarching theme of the party’s news release, which was conveyed in the document’s subtitle: "Mandel first claimed bank fraud in June 2010 but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his Senate campaign." Of interest are the two core contentions -- that Mandel claimed bank fraud in June 2010 and did nothing until now. But before we go any further, let’s dispense with some helpful background. The two banks in question are Bank of New York Mellon and State Street Corp. Combined, they hold more than $41 billion in international assets owned by four of Ohio’s five pension funds. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine sued BNY Mellon in March 2012, accusing the bank of overcharging two pension funds on foreign currency transactions. DeWine was still reviewing the foreign currency practices of State Street, his spokeswoman said at the time. Mandel announced his decision to dump both banks on March 19, days after DeWine filed the suit. In a news release, the treasurer’s office noted that BNY Mellon and State Street "have been accused of defrauding pension funds in Ohio and numerous other states." PolitiFact Ohio is not about to referee these court disputes. Instead, we set out to determine whether the Ohio Democratic Party was correct in its criticism of Mandel’s actions. The party’s March 20 news release offered three supporting statements in bullet-point fashion and under the heading "Here’s what we know." The three points, as they appeared: 21 months ago in June 2010, Mandel first alleged fraud by Bank of New York Mellon and State Street Nine months ago in June 2011, he asked Attorney General Mike DeWine to investigate "foreign currency exchange practices of the custodial banks" such as BNY and State Street. Despite turning it into a campaign issue, only yesterday did he actually take action. The state party has cited three news articles as key sources for these claims: a June 2010 Columbus Dispatch story, a September 2010 Cincinnati Enquirer story and a Crain’s Cleveland Business report from 2011. Let’s dig into the party’s timeline. The "21 months ago" claim is based on the Dispatch article. Mandel at the time was running against Boyce, the Democratic incumbent. Other Ohio newspapers first reported issues about State Street around that time. Although the Democrats cite The Dispatch piece as the first utterance of fraud, the story led with Mandel attacking Boyce for "cronyism and corruption." His main beef was that Boyce, his opponent, had awarded work to State Street, which had hired his top deputy’s friend as a lobbyist. A paragraph in The Dispatch story noted that State Street was "under investigation in California for possible fraud involving $56 million in state pension funds there." But nowhere in the article did Mandel directly address that State Street probe. And he did not mention BNY Mellon at all. It would be wrong to say that the State Street accusations were not on his radar screen. Ten days before The Dispatch ran its story, Plain Dealer reporter Joe Guillen wrote a detailed piece on Boyce’s decision to award the contract to State Street despite the issues in California. Mandel is not quoted, but three days later he referenced the story in a letter demanding answers from State Street officials. The letter, a copy of which was provided to Guillen, alluded to the California lawsuit but mainly inquired about State Street’s hiring of Noure Alo, the lobbyist tied to Boyce’s deputy. For his part, Boyce always has maintained he did nothing improper. Between news coverage and the letter, three things are apparent. One, Mandel was mainly concerned about contract-steering, an explicit accusation his spokesman made to the Dayton Daily News on May 23, 2010. Two, the fraud accusation did not originate with Mandel; it originated in California. Three, Mandel never raised concerns about BNY Mellon. PolitiFact Ohio scoured a LexisNexis database of news articles and found the first mention of Mandel and BNY Mellon in an Associated Press story that ran a few days before the Crain’s report, six months after Mandel took office. It also is important to note that Mandel did not accuse State Street of fraud in Ohio. If you’re keeping score at home, so far the Ohio Democratic Party’s timeline is correct on one count. Mandel did ask DeWine to investigate both banks nine months ago, in June 2011. Yet it is that fact that contradicts the remaining half of the state party’s claim -- that Mandel did not "actually take action" until last month. The sentiment here is that Mandel allowed fraud to occur for more than a year after taking office. There is no dispute that Mandel asked for an investigation six months into his term. PolitiFact Ohio asked Mandel’s staff for more background on the process and learned an internal review began even sooner. The findings turned up enough abnormalities involving both BNY Mellon and State Street to warrant DeWine’s outside investigation, officials said. Mandel spokesman Seth Unger told PolitiFact Ohio that pension fund managers were alerted to the treasurer’s suspicions and reminded to be vigilant on matters of foreign currency exchanges. Dumping BNY Mellon and State Street on Day One would have been impossible, Unger said. Mandel wanted to be certain there were grounds for replacing them before pulling the trigger. "We really did our due diligence," Unger said. The Ohio Democratic Party’s claim -- "Mandel first claimed bank fraud in June 2010 but did nothing for more than a year while raising money for his Senate campaign" -- collapses under scrutiny. It is incorrect and misleading to say Mandel "claimed bank fraud" against BNY Mellon and State Street when he focused his public statements solely on State Street and clearly attributed them to the investigation in California. It also is misleading to strip those statements of the full context: that Mandel was mainly concerned about contract-steering and cronyism. Furthermore, it is ridiculous for the Ohio Democratic Party to charge Mandel with more than a year of neglect when it acknowledges the DeWine investigation began last June. That leaves the party without a sturdy leg of truthfulness to stand on. Pants on Fire!

pomt-05890	"Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country, and many of them go uncounted each election."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/07/kathleen-clyde/kathleen-clyde-says-ohio-among-leaders-provisional/	Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted said last month that the state’s legislators should repeal House Bill 194, the controversial overhaul of election laws that Republicans pushed through the General Assembly last spring. Senate Republicans began working on a new voting plan. Democrats, who had led the effort to put HB 194 on next November's ballot as a referendum, said they were prepared to introduce election legislation that would lead to more voter participation and more ballots being counted. State Rep. Kathleen Clyde of Kent said at a news conference that the Democrats' measures would reduce the number of reasons for making voters cast provisional ballots, make election officials and not voters responsible for mistakes with ballots and require provisional ballots to be counted unless there was clear evidence of wrongdoing. "Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country, and many of them go uncounted each election," she said. Provisional ballots are used when there is a question about a voter's eligibility at the polling station. That could include not having the documentation to verify their identity as a registered voter or a question about whether they voted absentee. Poll workers allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until the problem is sorted out, and if the person is an eligible voter, then the ballot is counted. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check to see if Ohio was really among the national leaders. We asked Rep. Clyde for her numbers and source. "Ohio had 204,651 provisional ballots in 2008, the last presidential election year," she responded via email. Of that total, "roughly 40,000 were not counted. Forty-thousand is indeed many." Clyde said her numbers came from the Election Day Survey Report of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. We checked the report. It said that three states — California, New York, and Ohio — reported the highest numbers of provisional ballots cast, accounting for 59.4 percent of the nation’s total. PolitiFact Ohio found that the numbers also coincided with a report on provisional voting by the nonpartisan Pew Center on the States. We also looked at the commission’s report for the 2010 midterm election. That year, too, it said, California and Ohio were the states with the largest number of provisional ballots, accounting for almost two-thirds of all provisional ballots cast nationwide. In Ohio there were 105,015 provisional ballots cast and 11,753 -- or more than 10 percent -- were rejected. Clyde’s claim had two components. The first part was that "Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country." Data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and from the Pew Center on the States backs that claim. Ohio was among the leaders for number of provisional ballots for both the 2008 and 2010 general elections. The second part of her claim was that "many of them go uncounted each election." How many is many? We think tens of thousands of ballots can be classified as "many." In 2008, nearly 40,000 provisional ballots, just under 20 percent, were rejected in Ohio. In the 2010 election, More than 11,000, slightly more than 11 percent, were rejected. Only three states rejected more ballots. Among states larger than Ohio, Texas, New York, Florida and Pennsylvania all had fewer provisional ballots and fewer rejections. On the Truth-O-Meter, Clyde’s statement rates True.

pomt-03864	The Georgia Senate ethics resolution "doesn't define cap."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/11/david-ralston/georgia-ethics-resolution-lacks-key-detail-house-s/	PolitiFact wasn’t created to make elected officials more careful about what they say in public, but we like being on their mind. Georgia House Speaker David Ralston was about to relay a statistic he was told that Georgia is the second-busiest state in terms of movie production. Then he qualified his remarks. "I haven’t checked this yet, but I’m sure PolitiFact, if they’re here, will," Ralston told the Atlanta Press Club, drawing some laughter. Don’t worry, Mr. Speaker. We’re more interested in something else you said about a piece of ethics legislation. In the past year, the Georgia Legislature has debated how it can improve its ethics guidelines to counter criticism that it is too beholden to lobbyists. On the first day of the 2013 legislative session, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a much-publicized resolution aimed at limiting gifts from lobbyists to the Senate. Ralston, though, made an interesting claim about Senate Resolution 1, which passed in January. "It doesn’t define a cap," Ralston, a Republican from Blue Ridge, said during a question-and-answer session with the audience. "I don’t know if it means $100 a day or if it’s $100 a minute." PolitiFact Georgia was in the audience, and we wondered whether the speaker was correct about whether the resolution defines a cap. Going into the current legislative session, Georgia was one of just three states that did not restrict lobbyists’ gifts to legislators. For years, lobbyists could make unlimited gifts to elected officials, provided they disclosed all spending. Lobbyists spent about $1.6 million a year, mostly on food, trips and event tickets for lawmakers, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Georgians were not happy with the rules, or lack thereof. Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly voted in favor of a cap on lobbyist gifts during a nonbinding referendum July 31. Ralston has chided the Senate about its resolution, at one point famously calling it a "visor" instead of a "cap." The speaker introduced his own ethics legislation, House Bill 142, which the House passed Feb. 25. Ralston believes his legislation fits the bill of a cap. Others say break out the sun screen. The Senate is now reviewing the House bill. So back to the Senate resolution. We reviewed the resolution’s language about gifts and here’s what it says: "No senator shall accept any gift, other than those specified in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, with a value in excess of $100.00 from a registered lobbyist or a single gift from a group of registered lobbyists with a value in excess of $100.00." Subparagraph 3 outlined the types of items that could be accepted without regard to the $100 limit. Ralston’s spokesman, Marshall Guest, thought the claim was straightforward. We ran the speaker’s claim by Steve Anthony, who worked 14 years as chief of staff to Tom Murphy, a Democrat who was Georgia’s House speaker for nearly 30 years. "He’s right," said Anthony, who teaches political science at Georgia State University. "It doesn’t give a time period." Anthony added, "I think the assumption is $100 per event." William Perry, the executive director of Common Cause Georgia, has pushed state lawmakers to enact tougher ethics legislation for years. The organization’s goals include working to strengthen public participation and transparency in state and local government. He called the Senate resolution a "great first step" but acknowledged it takes a few reads to understand what it means. Like Anthony, Perry said the bill puts a $100 limit per event from lobbyists and said lobbyists and lawmakers understand the resolution’s intent. Perry is critical of the House bill, saying it allows the bigger lobbying firms to still give large sums of money by giving it to an entire county delegation -- which could be as small as two legislators -- or to the entire Georgia General Assembly. So where does this leave us? We think Ralston has a point. The resolution doesn’t clearly define how often a lobbyist can give up to $100 to a state senator. Lawmakers and lobbyists understand the resolution’s intent, others say. We rate the speaker’s claim Mostly True.	None	David Ralston	None	None	None	2013-03-11T06:00:00	2013-02-26	['None']
pomt-12471	"When I became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/may/05/antonio-villaraigosa/villaraigosas-mostly-true-claim-about-rise-school-/	Early in his campaign for California governor, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has repeatedly touted his accomplishments as an education reformer. At a candidates’ forum in Sacramento in late March, Villaraigosa had this to say about his involvement with the Los Angeles Unified School District: "When I became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72." This wasn’t his first reference to graduation rates. Villaraigosa also cited it in his campaign press release announcing his run for governor in November 2016. It’s safe to say he'll talk a lot about this between now and the 2018 election. We wanted to know whether the district’s graduation rate really had improved that much and whether Villaraigosa was directly involved in these gains. We set out on a fact check. First, some background Villaraigosa is among several prominent Democrats competing to succeed Jerry Brown as governor. Others include California Treasurer John Chiang; Delaine Eastin, the state’s former superintendent for public instruction; and Gavin Newsom, the state’s current lieutenant governor. Republican candidates include John Cox, a venture capitalist from San Diego County and Rosie Grier, a former professional football player. Tracking the Truth: Hear a claim you want fact-checked? Email us at politifactca@capradio.org, tweet us @CAPolitiFact or contact us on Facebook. Villaraigosa was mayor of Los Angeles from July 2005 through July 2013. Soon after taking office, he made a failed bid to take control of the school district. His office did eventually, however, take over the administration of several of the district’s lowest performing schools. Now, the numbers Asked for evidence about the graduation rate numbers, Villaraigosa’s campaign spokeswoman Michelle Jeung cited two studies conducted in the mid 2000s, and detailed in news reports from the time, that found the district’s graduation rate hovering at about 44 percent. As reported by the LA Daily News in June 2006, "Just 44 percent of Los Angeles Unified students receive a high school diploma, making the 727,000-student district's graduation rate among the lowest of large urban school districts," according to a national study by the nonpartisan publication Education Week. The report relied on enrollment data from the 2002-2003 school year, according to a Los Angeles Times article. Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman also cited a March 2005 Harvard University study, Confronting the Graduation Rate Crisis in California. It put the district’s graduation rate at 45.3 percent, based on enrollment data from the early 2000s. At the time, L.A. Unified officials strongly criticized the Education Week report, saying in the Daily News article that the district’s graduation rate, by that time, was "closer to 64 percent." The district’s chief instructional officer called the Education Week study "horrifically flawed" and "unfair" because of the methodology used, according to a Los Angeles Times article from the same year. They questioned the use of the data from 2002-2003 and said the school district had made graduation rate strides. District officials added that the studies did not take into account students who move during the year. "We're making real gains in this. We're keeping kids in longer, but we're also getting more accurate information," LA Unified Superintendent Roy Romer said. Graduation rate as Villaraigosa left There’s less contention over the school district’s graduation rate at the end of Villaraigosa’s time as mayor. For the 2013-2014 school year, which immediately followed Villaraigosa’s final term, the district had a 70.2 percent graduation rate, according to California Department of Education data. The following two school years, the rate increased to 72.2 percent and then 77 percent. Peter Tira, a spokesman for the state Department of Education, noted there’s been a change in how graduation rates are calculated. Before the 2009-2010 school year, the state included students who had transferred to adult schools or been sent to juvenile hall when it calculated graduation rates. Tira said it no longer includes these and other categories of students. Villaraigosa’s role There’s disagreement over just how low the school district’s graduation rates were in the early-to-mid 2000s. But there’s little doubt Villaraigosa charged head-first into education reforms as mayor. Some informed observers of Los Angeles politics and education told us the former mayor does deserve credit for improvements at the school district, though they say it wasn’t his doing alone. One of them is Ben Austin, who served as deputy mayor under former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. He said Villaraigosa endorsed and helped elect a majority of the district’s school board. "He exercised a tremendous amount of influence over the school board to the point of installing his own superintendent" through the board, added Austin, who serves on an advisory board for Students Matter, a nonprofit that promotes access to quality public education. Austin said he supported Villaraigosa in his runs for mayor. Villaraigosa’s spokeswoman cited the former mayor’s creation in 2007 of the nonprofit Partnership for Los Angeles schools as one of his biggest education reforms. Through the Partnership, Villaraigosa took over 16 of the district’s worst-performing schools. Citing data released by the school district, the Partnership reported a 41 percent graduation rate increase at its schools from 2008 to 2015. During his time as mayor, Villaraigosa repeatedly clashed with the city’s teachers union over school reforms. In a statement, United Teachers Los Angeles Alex Caputo-Pearl said it was "a stretch at best" to say Villaraigosa was responsible for the district’s improved graduation rates. Dan Schnur is director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. He is a former Republican consultant. Schnur said he has no reason to dispute the graduation rate numbers cited by Villaraigosa. "The question is: Who deserves the credit for that happening? (Villaraigosa) did prioritize the issue in his campaign and in his administration," Schnur said. "The case can be made that his use of the bully pulpit (as mayor) was a contributing factor." Schnur’s wife, Cecile Ablack, served as Villaraigosa's deputy mayor for communications. Experts told us much of the credit goes to the district’s students and the school board Villaraigosa helped form. "He elected a (school board) majority of pretty bold reformers," Austin noted. Our ruling California gubernatorial candidate and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed about the Los Angeles Unified School District: "When I became mayor of Los Angeles, we had a 44 percent (high school) graduation rate. I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72." A 2006 study by the nonpartisan Education Week placed the district’s graduation rate at 44 percent, while a Harvard study the year before placed the rate at 45.3 percent. They both used enrollment data from the early 2000s. School district officials in 2006 disputed the findings, saying improvements had been made and the rate was closer to 64 percent. District data shows that rate had climbed to 70.2 percent immediately after Villaraigosa’s term ended. It rose to 72.2 percent and then 77 percent in the following two years. Several observers of Los Angeles politics and education said Villaraigosa doesn’t get all the credit but did play an outsized role. He helped elect a reform-minded school board, install a superintendent and created a nonprofit that took control of and helped improve the district’s worst performing schools. The dispute over the district’s view of its graduation rate is missing from Villaraigosa’s statement. As is the fact that the studies used data from the early 2000s, a few years before Villaraigosa took office. But there’s certainly evidence to back up the former mayor’s claim about graduation rate improvements and his influence. In the end, we rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-12381	"Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/are-nicaragua-and-syria-only-countries-not-sign-pa/	Just a few hours before President Donald Trump was set to announce whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change, Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz questioned the president’s reported intent to walk away from the accord. "Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough. What's Trump's excuse?" the representative from Florida tweeted June 1. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s promise to "cancel" the Paris Agreement is one of more than 100 promises we are tracking on the Trump-O-Meter. News outlets reported that Trump was leaning toward exiting the global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep global average temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius. Wasserman Schultz tweet left us wondering if she was right about only two nations — Syria and Nicaragua — not signing the agreement, and that the Central American nation refused to sign because the agreement "wasn’t tough enough." Information from the United Nations and statements by Nicaraguan representatives support her statement. The Paris Agreement The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. It consists of 197 Parties (196 States and 1 regional economic integration organization). Among them are the United States, Syria and Nicaragua. The UNFCCC’s ultimate goal is "preventing ‘dangerous’ human interference with the climate system," that includes greenhouse gas concentrations, according to the UNFCCC’s website. Parties to the UNFCCC during a December 2015 session in Paris adopted the Paris Agreement, seeking "to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change." One of the objectives is to hold the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. A total of 175 parties signed the agreement on April 22, 2016, according to information from the UN. The agreement remained opened for signatures from April 22, 2016, to April 21, 2017. The latest nation to sign was Uzbekistan, on April 19. Overall total signatories: 195. The only countries in the world that did not sign: Syria and Nicaragua. The Paris Agreement came into effect in November 2016 after 55 countries accounting for at least 55 percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions formally ratified the agreement. So far, 147 parties have ratified the agreement. Wasserman Schultz office referred us to several news reports indicating that if the United States abandons the Paris agreement, it would join Syria and Nicaragua as nonparticipants. Reuters in December 2015 reported that Nicaragua objected to the climate agreement "saying it did not do enough to protect ‘Mother Earth,’ in a symbolic protest after the deal had been formally adopted." The news agency noted that Paul Oquist, head of the Nicaraguan delegation at the December 2015 session, said wealthy nations should do more to reduce their emissions. Nicaragua also had said developed nations were "not doing enough to reduce their use of carbon and are not providing sufficient funding to help the developed world adapt to the impact of climate change," Reuters reported. "We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure," Oquist told Climate Home in 2015, a media organization covering climate news. He added: "It’s a not a matter of being troublemakers, it’s a matter of the developing countries surviving." In September 2016, a Spanish-language post by the United Nations also said that the Nicaraguan vice president, Moisés Omar Halleslevens Acevedo, had reiterated his nation’s concerns on global warming but did not believe the Paris Agreement would prevent the worsening of the global issue. "Many of us concur that what was agreed in Paris is not sufficient," and more ambitious actions are urgent, Halleslevens Acevedo told the UN General Assembly in September 2016. Nicaraguan media have also reported that Nicaragua’s absence from the agreement is due to its concerns over the agreement, not out of lack of concern for climate change. Amid a civil war since 2011, Syria’s participation in the agreement has been difficult because members of the Syrian government are subject to European and American sanctions. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz tweeted, "Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough." A total 195 of the 197 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change signed the Paris Agreement. That includes all the countries in the world, except Syria and Nicaragua. Nicaraguan representatives have said the Paris Agreement is "not sufficient" and believe rich nations should do more to reduce their emissions. We rate Wasserman Schultz’ claim True.

pomt-09581	U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison “has voted nine separate times to raise the national debt ceiling.”	true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/27/rick-perry/us-sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-us-sen-kay-bailey-hutc/	Gov. Rick Perry casts his leading Republican challenger, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, as a fiscally irresponsible lawmaker who’d bring a free-spending approach to state government. Amplifying that theme, Perry’s campaign said Nov. 30: “Hutchison has voted nine separate times to raise the national debt ceiling.” We wondered if that was so. Perry’s camp compiled votes — undisputed by Hutchison — showing that since joining the Senate in 1993, Hutchison has voted nine times to raise the ceiling. But she’s also voted five times against raising the ceiling. Our request for an explanation of Hutchison’s votes didn’t generate an immediate reply from her. If she does pipe up, we’ll update this item. UPDATE: Hutchison spokesman Jeff Sadosky offered a statement Jan. 28 suggesting that Hutchison's "aye" votes while George W. Bush was president reflected her support for his across-the-board tax cuts and spending initiatives including commitments to fight terrorism, provide prescription drugs to senior citizens and rebuild after 9/11 and Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike. Sadosky said: "She has voted against efforts to increase the debt ceiling when it is necessitated by wasteful spending like that seen in the stimulus bill and in the annual discretionary appropriations bills proposed by the Democratic-led Congress and presidency." We wondered anyway what any vote on the debt ceiling really means. Josh Gordon of The Concord Coalition, which was founded by the late Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass) to advocate for long-term fiscal responsibility, advised that votes to raise the ceiling might be portrayed as big deals to score political points. In reality, they’re not, he said, though they are necessary. “If they didn’t do it, the (U.S.) Treasury would no longer be able to borrow money,” Gordon said. “Everything from savings bonds to Treasury bills to very short-term financial instruments of the Federal Reserve would cease to be worth anything. It would basically destroy the economy.” Unlike congressional votes on taxes or spending, Gordon said, lawmakers' votes to increase the debt limit aren't necessarily indicators of members' fiscal philosophies. Gordon said the fact all but two of Hutchison’s votes to raise the ceiling occurred with Republicans in charge of the Senate was probably not a coincidence. Typically in Congress, the majority party bears responsibility for attending to essential business, including hikes in the debt ceiling if necessary. When the ceiling issue comes up, members of the minority party can vote "no" knowing the other side will muster the votes to do it. Hutchison’s five “no” votes occurred when Democrats controlled the Senate. With Democrats holding the Senate majority, she voted for raising the ceiling as part of the Wall Street rescue plan approved in October 2008 and earlier voted for raising the ceiling in June 2002. Perry got all of Hutchison’s “yes” votes right. We rate his claim as True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-01-27T06:22:32	2009-11-30	['United_States']
pomt-11748	"In a 2014 case involving a man convicted of abusing two underage girls, Judge Roy Moore disagreed and wrote the dissenting opinion."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/06/doug-jones/jones-ad-wrongly-attacks-moore-sex-crime-case/	In the Alabama Senate race, Democrat Doug Jones launched an ad to suggest Republican Roy Moore goes easy on sex offenders. Moore called on stations airing the ad to pull it, saying it "blatantly misrepresents the facts and my judicial record." The ad speaks of three cases from Moore’s days on the Alabama State Supreme Court. Here’s the full text from the ad, although this fact-check focuses only on the first case from 2014. "Alabama, there's a pattern. In a 2014 case involving a man convicted of abusing two underage girls, Judge Roy Moore disagreed and wrote the dissenting opinion. In a 2015 case involving a man who pleaded guilty to raping an underage girl, Roy Moore dissented again. And Roy Moore was the only Supreme Court justice who sided with a felon convicted of sexual abuse of a child at a daycare center. Court documents, real facts. Roy Moore's disturbing conduct." On television, the visuals are important. Here’s what viewers saw. In one of the most reliably Republican states, Moore has been fighting headwinds after multiple reports that he made sexual advances on young women under 18 when he was in his 30s. The Jones attack ad plays to that issue. In the 2014 case, Jones misappropriated technical elements of the legal saga to leave voters with the wrong idea. The 2014 case In 2010, Sherman Fitzgerald Tate, then in his mid 30s, worked as a mentor with the Youth Advocate Program at Pointe Academy in Mobile, Ala. The court-funded program aimed to help troubled teens. A security camera recorded Tate bringing two 15-year-old girls into a conference room. He was not their assigned mentor. There was no tape of what took place inside the room. The two girls accused him of coercing them to touch him and each other sexually. Tate was convicted on two counts of second-degree sodomy. His lawyer wanted to bring in testimony that the two girls had a romantic relationship with each other and that Tate had told one of the girls’ mother about it. That information would, the lawyer said, give the girls a reason to invent a charge against Tate. But under Alabama law, victims of sexual assault are shielded from any exploration of their past sexual activity, because it could bias a jury against them. This is a fundamental principle that holds in many states. The trial judge blocked the testimony and an appeals court agreed. Tate’s lawyer brought the issue to the state supreme court. The majority of the justices, five, declined to hear the case. Moore and two other justices disagreed. In his dissent, Moore basically argued that courts in Massachusetts, Mississippi, Colorado and elsewhere had allowed similar evidence in certain cases and there was a reasonable argument that the facts in Tate’s case "would make the proposed cross-examination relevant to show that the victims had possibly fabricated the charges against Tate." The key line in Moore’s dissent, however, is the last one: "I believe that we should resolve this material question of first impression." In other words, Moore's dissent was about resolving the legal question for future cases. A matter of law We reached several experts in appellate law and all of them agreed that Moore was only arguing that the court should hear the case. "He was saying there’s a decent legal issue in the case that the court ought to resolve," David Moran at the University of Michigan Law School. "It read like a perfectly reasonable dissent, and it would be grossly unfair to attribute anything to him based on a dissent from a denial of review." Peter Smith at George Washington University Law School agreed, saying that at that point in the process, Moore was not challenging the case itself against Tate, but the legal issue of what testimony was admissible. "In theory, if the court had heard the case, he could have ruled against the guy," Smith said. Smith said Moore was telegraphing some sympathy for Tate’s position, but again, this dissent alone did not amount to disagreeing with Tate’s conviction. The other two cases The ad raises two other cases to show Moore’s "disturbing conduct." The 2015 case involved second-degree rape and like the charges against Tate, the issue was whether the sexual activity of the victim should have been presented at the trial. Moore and two other justices joined in saying the court should decide the matter. In the ad’s final example, Moore was the lone dissenter. The case involved a 17-year-old boy who performed a sexual act on a 4-year-old boy at a daycare center. The teen was convicted on two counts -- first-degree sodomy of a child under 12 and first-degree sodomy by forcible compulsion. Moore took issue with the second count, arguing that there was no evidence of an implied threat of serious physical injury or death in the case. The matter was made more complicated because the offender was under 18, which put him in a gray zone under state law. Moore argued that the court was going beyond what lawmakers had written. Our ruling An ad from the Jones campaign said that Moore disagreed and dissented in a case involving the abuse of two underage girls. There is no question that Moore dissented, but the ad provides no context for what Moore disagreed with. The glaring lack of detail leaves reasonable viewers with the impression that Moore disagreed with the conviction. That’s not what he said.

pomt-07943	"The White House promised us that all the spending would keep unemployment under 8 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/26/michele-bachmann/rep-michele-bachmann-says-white-house-promised-sti/	In her Tea Party Express-sponsored rebuttal to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., repeated an oft-used attack on the economic stimulus -- that the White House promised it would keep unemployment under 8 percent (and failed). "Unfortunately, the president's strategy for recovery was to spend a trillion dollars on a failed stimulus program, fueled by borrowed money," Bachmann said. "The White House promised us that all the spending would keep unemployment under 8 percent. Not only did that plan fail to deliver, but within three months, the national jobless rate spiked to 9.4 percent. It hasn't been lower for 20 straight months. While the government grew, we lost more than 2 million jobs." The claim that the White House "promised" the stimulus would keep unemployment under 8 percent has been a popular attack line, cited repeatedly by Fox's Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck and other conservative pundits. And we have fact-checked it twice, first in July 2009 when then House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said, "We were promised. The president said we would keep unemployment under 8.5 percent (if the stimulus passed)" and again when columnist George Will said something similar in July 2010. On several occasions as the stimulus was being considered, President Obama warned that if "dramatic action" were not taken, the recession could linger for years, and "the unemployment rate could reach double digits." But we could find no instance of anyone in the administration making a public pledge along the lines of "if we pass the stimulus, we promise unemployment will stay below 8 percent." Rather, the claim has its roots in a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. As we all know now, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and was at 9.4 percent in December. But what we saw from the administration in January 2009 was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." The administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong. In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated." Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. So, is the fact that unemployment rose, even as the stimulus unfolded, proof that it has failed? White House officials have steadfastly maintained that the stimulus is working, that even though the unemployment rate has risen higher than projected in January 2009, it would be even worse if not for the stimulus. In a blog posting for the New York Times, economist Paul Krugman explained, "There’s a baseline, which is the prediction of what the economy would have done without the stimulus, and there’s the predicted change from that baseline that is the effect of the stimulus. Clearly, the baseline was way too optimistic. But the question under discussion was how much effect relative to the baseline the stimulus was supposed to have had by now." That was the gist of Obama's claim in a town hall meeting on the economy in Racine, Wis., on June 30, 2010. "Now, every economist who has looked at it has said that the recovery did its job," Obama said. "It put a brake on the collapse of the economy. We avoided a Great Depression. We are now growing again. The problem is, No. 1, it’s hard to argue sometimes, things would have been a lot worse. Right? So people kind of say, yeah, but unemployment is still at 9.6. Yes, but it’s not 12 or 13, or 15." Obama is correct that many independent economists agree that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has (though in fairness, not every economist agrees with that). But there is an inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. And how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The implication of Bachmann's comment is that rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus didn't work. Most economists don't agree -- and argue that without the stimulus, unemployment would have been worse -- but it's difficult to empirically prove one way or the other. The White House claimed the stimulus would improve the employment picture and applied that to the baseline for projected unemployment going forward. As Krugman said, the baseline projection turned out to be way off (most economists at the time underestimated the severity of rising unemployment). Bachmann's claim suggests Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment. So we find Bachmann's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03481	Says "Having organizations parading as being social welfare organizations and then being involved in the political combat harkens back to why the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/13/earl-blumenauer/did-1913-revenue-act-prohibit-political-organizati/	Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., finds himself in the crosshairs of the web-o-sphere after he condemned political organizations "parading" as social welfare groups, which don’t have to disclose donors. Here’s what the congressman said at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing into allegations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups for scrutiny, including the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage. We offer the relevant portion it in its entirety. "It's everybody's right to participate in politics, and well you should. But I think having organizations parading as being social welfare organizations and then being involved in the political combat harkens back to why the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited and why I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague, Mr. Doggett, saying that we ought to stop this regulation interpretation from 1959 that invites people to raise vast sums of money and keep it secret and to engage in political activity -- and some of it, I think, not necessarily promoting the social welfare of our country." (our emphasis) Our question was a simple one: Was there a tax statute 100 years ago that specifically prohibited political groups from claiming tax exempt status under a social welfare provision? We checked with the Internal Revenue Service, thinking this was a pretty straightforward question. Alas, the spokesman was of no help. "I must decline to comment since an IRS opinion would appear to be a statement on the accuracy (of) what the Member of Congress said. The language of the 1913 act can be researched," wrote Richard Panick, in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. So away we went. Thanks, federal government. (Not.) We learned that in 1862, President Lincoln approved a revenue-raising measure to help pay for Civil War expenses, creating the office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. In 1913, states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, giving Congress the ability to levy and collect income taxes. The Revenue Act of 1913, also called the Underwood Tariff Act, established what we consider the modern income tax system. Much of it dealt with lowering tariffs on goods. It included a tax exemption for organizations devoted to social welfare, the precursor to today’s Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(4). (And the Form 1040 was born.) The language of Section II, G(a)states that the tax shall not apply to: "labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations, or to mutual savings banks ... nor to cemetery companies, organized and operated exclusively for the mutual benefit of their members, nor to any corporation or association organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, or educational purposes … nor to business leagues, nor to chambers of commerce or boards of trade, not organized for profit or no part of the net income of which inures to the benefit of the private stockholder or individual; nor to any civic league or organization not organized for profit, but operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare:" (our emphasis) We’re truncating here, but you get the picture: Groups dedicated to civic benevolence did not have to pay federal tax, so long as private individuals did not profit. There is no mention of political activity, whether it’s prohibited or not. There is little explanation for why this exemption existed. Patrick Malone, spokesman for Rep. Blumenauer, said that the 1913 Act placed a prohibition on political organizations by not including such activity as being eligible for exemption as social welfare. "We think it is extremely accurate to say that there is a distinction between social welfare groups and political groups, since the former is included and the latter is not, and to say that there is clearly no exemption for political groups," Malone wrote in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. But is not including the same as prohibiting? We turned to Richard Schmalbeck, a law professor at Duke University and an expert on nonprofit tax issues. He understands what Blumenauer is getting at -- groups that engage in political activity should claim tax exemption under another part of the tax code rather than hide out under "social welfare" -- but figuring out legislative intent from 100 years ago isn’t so clear-cut. "I can’t entirely endorse what he’s said, because we just don’t know," Schmalbeck said. "They didn’t bother to explain. They just didn’t have staff to do it, and it wasn’t the habit." Roberta Mann, a law professor at the University of Oregon, agreed with Schmalbeck that the law was silent on the issue, but clarified that the law implicitly prohibited political activity. "The tax-exempt rules were developed when election laws prohibited corporations (including tax-exempt corporations) from using their funds for political contributions," she wrote in an email. In any case, the Treasury Department has since tweaked the definition to say that "an organization is operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare if it is primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good and general welfare of the people of the community." (our emphasis) Specifically, the Treasury interpreted the code so that political activity did not count as "social welfare" but also did not disqualify a group from claiming a social welfare exemption. In other words, political activity must not be the group’s primary activity. We went back to Malone. He said two things signal to him that political groups are prohibited. One, Congress meant the list to be inclusive, because they were so detailed in the organizations included. Two, had Congress meant to include other unlisted activities, they could have used the phrase "include, but are not limited to." Congress has moved in recent years toward separating political activity from social welfare activity. Political groups and parties can claim tax-exempt status under the 527 section of the tax code. Since 2000, parties and political organizations have had to register as such, and disclose donors, Schmalbeck said. Of course, there are political groups on both the right and the left that probably should be categorized as a 527 but claim 501(c)(4) status. Why? "Social welfare" groups do not have to disclose donors -- a bonus for people keen to keep their political work private. PolitiFact Oregon is impressed by the lawyerly analysis from Blumenauer’s office. However, we have two professors who say the law is silent on political activity -- even if one of them sees an implicit prohibition -- and a plain reading of the law that states no explicit ban. Blumenauer said that "the statute a hundred years ago said that they were prohibited." There was no prohibition in the 1913 Act. The 1913 Act was silent on political activity, for whatever reasons. We rate his statement False.	None	Earl Blumenauer	None	None	None	2013-06-13T04:00:00	2013-06-04	['None']
pomt-11413	"California is 49th out of 50 in the United States in per capita housing units. Only Utah can lay claim to being lowest in per capita production."	true	/california/statements/2018/mar/21/gavin-newsom/true-california-ranks-49th-capita-housing-supply/	Runaway rents and out-of-reach home prices typify California’s housing landscape. To ease extreme costs, there are politicians who say they’re increasingly focused on boosting supply. Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is one. At a forum on March 8, 2018 in Sacramento, Newsom said California must break down barriers to building because it ranks "49th out of 50 in the United States in per capita housing units. Only Utah can lay claim to being lowest in per capita production." We know building homes in California can be a long, expensive process. But does the state really have the second lowest per capita housing supply in the nation? We opened the door on a fact check. Our research Newsom is the frontrunner in a crowded race for California governor. His campaign spokesman told us the statement is supported by an October 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute: "A Tool Kit to Close California’s Housing Gap: 3.5 Million Homes by 2025." We found the report — which Newsom cited later in his discussion at the forum — confirms the lieutenant governor’s claim. "California ranks 49th among the 50 US states for housing units per capita," the report said. "Benchmarked against other states on a housing units per capita basis, California is short about two million units. To satisfy pent-up demand and meet the needs of a growing population, California needs to build 3.5 million homes by 2025." Johnathan Woetzel, a director at the McKinsey Global Institute, said researchers used 2014 data from the U.S. Census Bureau in their analysis. He said the ranking cited by Newsom compares the ratio of people to housing units in each state. That specific ranking does not measure the pace of housing production over time, as the second part of Newsom’s statement might imply. Woetzel noted, however, that California’s pace of home building has significantly lagged behind other states. The institute is the business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, a worldwide consulting firm. Its report found California had 358 housing units per 1,000 people, much lower than the U.S. average of 419 but slightly ahead of Utah’s 347. SOURCE: McKinsey Global Institute, "A Tool Kit to Close California’s Housing Gap: 3.5 Million Homes by 2025" Not a new phenomenon California has long failed to meet its housing needs, according to the report. "Since the 1970s, the state has added 6.7 million households and 19 million people, but only 6.2 million homes. This means that over a 40-year period, the state added only 325 homes for every 1,000 additional people." Two outside experts told us the McKinsey report is credible. Carol Galante, professor of affordable housing and urban policy at UC Berkeley, said California’s low ranking "doesn’t surprise me." She said California’s housing production is stymied by the state’s complex regulatory system, including the land-use discretion of local governments, combined with the high fees developers must pay and then pass on to buyers. "The cost of building new housing in California is very expensive," Galante said. "New development has to pay for all of its new infrastructure. That didn’t use to be the case. In the 50s and the 60s and even through the 70s, we had a state system and a federal system that paid for the suburbs to be built through a public infrastructure." There’s also a problem on the demand side, Galante said, noting that wages aren’t keeping up with the ability to buy new homes. Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, added that Newsom’s statement "sounds accurate," and that the McKinsey report is credible. Michael cited California’s regulatory climate as the biggest factor is slowing housing production. More recent data? The McKinsey report examined figures from 2014. We couldn’t find more recent data comparing per capita housing units by state. But we did find the total number of housing units produced in California in each year from 2014 through 2016. And based on the totals, it appears California’s rank near the bottom of per capita housing supply is accurate given the relatively slow building pace, at least compared with pre-Great Recession levels. For example, California added 69,000 units in 2014; 68,000 in 2015; and 89,000 in 2016, according to the most recent data available from the California Department of Finance, all while the state’s population increased by roughly 300,000 per year. Those numbers are far less than California’s home building peak of 2005, when 205,000 units were added. "Before the housing bust, the lowest year on record was 1995, during which just shy of 75,000 units were built," notes a report from the California State Association of Counties. Our ruling Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed California ranks "49th out of 50 in the United States in per capita housing units. Only Utah can lay claim to being lowest in per capita production." Findings from an October 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute, using census data from 2014, support Newsom’s statement. Two independent policy experts affirmed the report and its findings showing the wide gap between California’s housing demand and supply. There’s nothing significant missing from Newsom’s statement.

pomt-09962	"Our government has now 'spent, lent, or committed' $12.8 trillion in its attempt to blunt the recession."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/15/mark-sanford/gov-sanford-cites-bloomberg-statistic-us-has-spent/	South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford has been highly critical of the Obama administration for spending too much on the economic stimulus. Recently, Sanford cited a statistic compiled by the Bloomberg news service that "our government has now 'spent, lent, or committed' $12.8 trillion in its attempt to blunt the recession." It's a figure Sanford used in a commentary for Human Events , a conservative publication, and again in a letter to the editor of the State Journal-Register in Springfield, Ill. It is taken from a March 31, 2009, Bloomberg story that begins, "The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve have spent, lent or committed $12.8 trillion, an amount that approaches the value of everything produced in the country last year, to stem the longest recession since the 1930s." At the bottom of the story is a chart breaking down how the number was derived. The lion's share — $7.7 trillion — comes from money lent or committed by the Federal Reserve for such things as credit discounts, debt purchases and bailouts of several financial institutions. Another $2 trillion relates to the FDIC, including liquidity guarantees and the purchase of risky bank assets. And lastly is the money the federal government is spending through the two stimulus packages (the $168 billion stimulus under President George W. Bush and the $787 billion stimulus under President Barack Obama), as well as the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, used to buy toxic assets, the mortgage-backed investments that triggered the nation's financial crisis. Economists caution that the government is not necessarily "out" all of that money. In the case of TARP money, for example, "the estimates are that we will get most of the money back," said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And in the case of collateral extended to the Federal Reserve and FDIC, "that's basically pledging to back up the operations of those organizations. We're pledging this money as collateral for that organization." It doesn't mean the money will ever be spent. And in the case of things like auto company bailouts, for example, the federal government got company stock and it's too early to know how much the government will get back on that. But presumably some. "At the end of the day, a large portion of that won't end up getting spent," Horney said. We had initially set out to fact-check Sanford for comment he made in a May 13, 2009, Fox Business Network interview when he said, "This stimulus package, this federal effort ... at some point you know we spent about 20 percent of world GDP on this thing. You look at about $13 trillion last year and it's almost like you know Soviet-era grain quotas are saying you will produce this amount of grain in Kazakhstan, never mind the realities of what is going on, on the ground." He's right that $13 trillion represents about 20 percent of the world GDP, but he left out the all-important qualifiers for the $13 trillion number, that it is money "spent, lent or committed," instead characterizing all of it as money the federal government "spent." Economists hopped all over him for that one. "If you are talking about an FDIC line of credit, there's a huge difference between that and spending X amount of dollars," Horney said. "Calling it spending is just wrong." The comment even drew rebuke from the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Saying $13 trillion has been spent is definitely misleading," said Alan Viard, a resident scholar at AEI. "It's not fair to combine all that with the word 'spent.'" The actual amount spent by the federal government to slow the recession is closer to $2 trillion, he said. Sanford spokesman Joel Sawyer acknowledged that Sanford left out the "spent, lent or committed" qualifiers in the Fox interview. In TV interviews, he said via e-mail, "questions come fast and furious and it's easy to leave out some words." But, he said, it'd be unfair to judge Sanford on that lone response when he had twice cited the statistic correctly, in writing. We agree, although we'll be watching carefully to make sure Sanford includes the proper caveats. Economists may disagree with this $13 trillion figure. There are many ways to calculate the amount the United States has pledged to stem the recession. But we think the Bloomberg calculation is one legitimate way. And we think it was certainly fair for Sanford to cite it, so long as he includes those all-important qualifiers. And on two occasions at least, he did. So we rate his comment True.

pomt-01241	"China has made enormous progress in its human rights. That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/17/xi-jinping/chinese-president-world-agrees-china-had-made-enor/	During a trip to Beijing this week, President Barack Obama announced major agreements with China, one to reduce carbon emissions and another to increase travel between the two countries. But the visit was not without controversy. During a press conference on Wednesday with Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Mark Landler, a White House correspondent for the New York Times, questioned China’s record on human rights and noted that some American media outlets, including his own organization, have experienced difficulty getting residency permits in China. "I’m wondering in the spirit of these reciprocal visa arrangements that you’ve agreed to this week with business people and students, isn’t it time to extend that sort of right to foreign correspondents who seek to cover your country?" Landler asked. Xi replied with a rare, unscripted response, telling foreign reporters they need to "obey China's laws and regulations." He went on to defend the country’s human rights record. "Ever since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and especially over the last three decades and more of China's reform and opening era, China has made enormous progress in its human rights," Xi said, according to a translation provided by the White House. "That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world." When we put the Chinese leader’s statement to the Truth-O-Meter, we found that human rights organizations were not as glowing in their assessments of China’s record on this issue. "It’s very standard Chinese political rhetoric," said Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch in an interview with PolitiFact. "It may be very nice that President Xi wishes his statement is true, but to suggest among other things people in China and around the world uniformly agree is ludicrous." Attempts to reach a spokesperson with the Chinese embassy were unsuccessful. Some improvements There is some good news. Experts and human rights advocates we spoke with say that improving economic conditions have indeed produced better living conditions for many Chinese citizens. As it is, when Chinese leaders claim progress in human rights, they are mostly referring to "human welfare," said Patrick Keenan, an expert in human rights and international law at the University of Illinois. "They're thinking about China's incredible economic growth and the ways that that economic growth has improved the lives of poor people in China," Keenan said. "China's growth hasn't helped everyone, of course, but it is true that poor people, on average, are better off than they were a generation ago." The reform era of the 1970s that opened China’s doors to a degree to the rest of the world resulted in a vast economic expansion, especially in the urban centers. Some social freedoms followed, such as the ability to move or take different jobs. However, such gains only accrued to certain sectors of the population. For example, according to Human Rights Watch, millions of farmers and herders who are Tibetan — an ethnic minority in China — have been subjected to a mass rehousing-and-relocation policy that forced them into socialist villages. And more generally, outside China’s rapidly growing cities, the economic gains have been less significant. There are two other notable areas of progress, each with limits. First, China has signed several international conventions and treaties pertaining to human rights. While there are clear examples of these agreements being ignored, the simple fact that China has agreed to them "is important because it creates an opportunity to make claims against the state," said Richardson of Human Rights Watch. All told, China has signed 10 of the 16 United Nations agreements pertaining to human rights. However, in most cases, China has attached a stated "reservation" that says they won’t abide by parts of the agreement that interfere with state laws. For example, while China agreed to an anti-torture convention, it added that it would not recognize a clause that allows the United Nations to investigate suspected torture, thus eliminating the enforcement mechanism. Second, Human Rights Watch notes some growth in civil society within China, such as new legal-aid services to victims of domestic violence, disabled children and other at-risk groups. These services often do not enjoy recognition from the state, though, and their leaders face imprisonment. Still, they represent seeds of change. "That degree of organization, participation and serving as a counter to the state is incredibly important," Richardson said. A long way to go Any acknowledgement that China has made gains on some issues comes with the caveat that the country is "starting off a much lower base than most," said Joshua Castellino, a law professor at Middlesex University in London and at the Irish Center for Human Rights. "Against (progress), there remain major issues on political participation, freedom of religion, and the use of the death penalty," Castellino said. On the death penalty, Human Rights Watch says China "leads the world in executions." While the exact number isn’t known, it’s estimated at about 4,000 a year. Additionally, Amnesty International estimates 500,000 people are "currently enduring punitive detention without charge or trial, and millions are unable to access the legal system to seek redress for their grievances." Many detained people are activists and political dissidents. China retains a one-party system, meaning citizens have no real choice or say in their government, and the Chinese Communist Party has authority over all judicial and legal proceedings in the country. The Internet has created opportunities for activists to engage, communicate and inform. However, China has aggressively moved to rein in these efforts through widespread censorship and blocking outside content from reaching Internet users in China. (This is known as the "Great Firewall.") Additionally, the Chinese Communist Party has recently moved to make it easier to charge activists and Internet critics as part of a crackdown on free expression. "Use of torture to extract confessions is prevalent, and miscarriages of justice are frequent due to weak courts and tight limits on the right to defense," according to Human Rights Watch. Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo is serving an 11-year sentence for non-violent protest against the state, while his wife remains under house arrest. Liu’s trial lasted 20 minutes, according to Amnesty International. These types of human rights abuses are deemed necessary by the state to preserve "social stability," Human Rights Watch says. Historically, China has used "re-education through labor" — forced labor camps — as a means of punishment. Officials have said they plan to abolish these camps, but so far it appears they have been replaced with other types of detention without trial. In addition, the disabled face discrimination in employment and education opportunities, workplace safety is a major concern, migrant workers cannot get residence permits that allow them access to education and other social services, and women can be punished, including being forced to have abortions, for violating government family planning laws. "In the U.S., Europe, and many other parts of the world, the idea of human ‘rights’ means things like freedom of religion, assembly, voting rights, anti-discrimination provisions to protect minorities and people with disabilities, and the like. On these measures, China is not doing well," Keenan said. "There is endemic local corruption, abuses of political opponents, restrictions on free expression and assembly, abuses of property rights, discrimination against people who are out of favor with the government, no real voting rights as that idea is understood in the West, and so on." Our ruling Chinese President Xi Jinping said, "China has made enormous progress in its human rights. That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world." There is a grain of truth here: China’s rapid economic growth has lifted millions of its residents, though hardly all of them, out of extreme poverty. Still, China remains an authoritarian state without truly free expression and democratic choice, and where political dissidents and those who practice civil disobedience face harsh penalties. Meanwhile, China executes thousands of people a year and imprisons or forces labor on hundreds of thousands of others with scant due process. Finally, many groups — ethnic minorities, the disabled, and migrant workers, to name a few — remain marginalized by the state.

pomt-13121	Says Chris Koster "opposes right-to-work efforts because he has taken $8 million from ‘union bosses.’"	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/nov/03/eric-greitens/greitens-connects-unrelated-facts-koster-right-wor/	Missouri is the scene of the most expensive governor’s race in the nation. On Sept. 30, Democrat Chris Koster and Republican Eric Greitens faced off in a debate in Branson. Greitens challenged Koster on several of his policies and political history, claiming that Koster is a "career politician" who opposes right-to-work efforts because he has taken "$8 million from union bosses." This number seemed high, so we decided to check out the claim. We also wondered if Koster, as Greitens said, opposed right-to-work efforts because of union campaign donations. Following the money The Greitens campaign directed us to the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s "Money Trail" page. According to this page, as of Oct. 30, Koster had received $12.2 million from what the Chamber says falls under the "unions" category. Koster's top three union contributors each gave his campaign more than $1 million. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a public services employees union, was Koster's top contributor, topping out at $1,250,000. AFSCME was followed closely by the Eastern Missouri Laborers' Educational & Benevolent Fund at $1,091,739 and Jobs and Opportunity, a democratic leadership PAC, coming in at $1,001,432. By far, Koster has received more contributions from unions over all other candidates running for any Missouri offices this year. The next highest total of union donations for any Missouri candidate is Democratic candidate for attorney general Teresa Hensley, with $692,849.00. Greitens doesn't even appear on the union donations list. On right-to-work Greitens also claimed Koster opposes right-to-work legislation. Right-to-work has been a hot-button topic for Missouri. Right-to-work laws essentially make it illegal to require employees to pay annual dues to a union. The decision to pass right-to-work laws are made on a state-by-state basis. So far, 26 states have passed right-to-work legislation. Missouri's Republican-majority legislature has passed right-to-work laws in the past, only to see them vetoed by Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, who leaves office in January. Greitens supports right-to-work legislation. His website states, "I believe we must have 'right-to-work' legislation to improve Missouri’s job climate." Opposing right-to-work legislation is an important part of Koster's campaign. Koster and other Democrats have used the term "right-to-work for less" to support their argument that a right-to-work law in Missouri would lead to lower pay for workers due to weakened collective bargaining efforts — efforts they say are made possible by those required fees. On the other hand, it's Greitens' belief that "right to work laws help the economy as a whole and union workers." The Greitens campaign directed us toward some statistics from the Labor Bureau of Statistics and pointed us specifically to Indiana. According to our email correspondence with the Greitens campaign, "Since Indiana passed Right to Work, it has gained 37,000 union jobs, while Missouri gained only 6,000." Taking a look at this information alone would suggest a correlation between right-to-work and increased union employment. As of 2015, 10 percent of Indiana's employed workers were members of unions, and 11.3 percent of workers were represented by unions. In Missouri, those numbers were 8.8 percent and 9.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, statistics for the median income growth from 2014-2015 comparing Missouri versus right-to-work states suggests support for Koster’s claim that right-to-work laws lead to lower salaries. According to the U.S. Census, growth in Missouri was 3.8 percent, while the average growth in right-to-work states was 3.2 percent. Because jobless rates vary so much from state to state, the role of right-to-work legislation in these numbers is difficult to assess. So Koster has received millions of dollars from unions, and he opposes right-to-work legislation. But Greitens' claim goes further and claims that Koster opposes that legislation because of the union donations. So is there any evidence that the donations affected Koster’s position on right-to-work? When we reached out to the Koster campaign, we received this response from David Turner, his campaign's communications director: "I reject the premise of the question and the assertion that the Attorney General's policy positions are at all influenced by campaign donations. Going back to the start of his career, Attorney General Koster has long record of advocating for working people, even when he was a Republican." Turner provided us with examples of Koster's advocacy "for working people" dating back to 2004. Included was a link to a Springfield News-Leader story published after Koster broke with the GOP and became a Democrat. The story states: "The Republican Party's disregard of workers rights, Koster said, is one reason he left the party." Our ruling Greitens said Koster received $8 million from unions and opposes right-to-work legislation. There is no doubt Koster opposes right-to-work laws. And Greitens actually understates the total amount of Koster’s labor donations. He has received more than $12 million from unions, according to the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. But there is no evidence his position against right-to-work is influenced by these donations. Greitens is taking two accurate talking points and putting them together in a misleading way.

pomt-11566	"Trump’s tax reform plan was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase."	false	/california/statements/2018/feb/05/phil-ting/false-claim-gop-tax-plan-nothing-more-middle-class/	Like many California Democrats, Assemblyman Phil Ting is no fan of the Republican tax plan signed by President Donald Trump. He has likened it to a tax giveaway for big corporations. The San Francisco lawmaker has proposed a surcharge on large companies in California, to claw back some of the billions of tax dollars that would be lost to the state under the plan. Such a bill, Ting said, would "help blunt the impact of the federal tax plan on everyday Californians." We wondered, however, whether Ting accurately described the GOP tax plan in the statement he provided to the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 21, 2018. "Trump’s tax reform plan was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase," Ting, who formerly served as San Francisco's Assessor-Recorder, said in the statement. "It is unconscionable to force working families to pay the price for tax breaks and loopholes benefiting corporations and wealthy individuals." We decided to check the facts, with a focus on the first part of Ting’s claim that the tax plan "was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase." His words could be considered a burst of political rhetoric, but they also make an assertion about how millions of Americans would be impacted by the GOP plan. Our research We spoke with experts at the centrist Tax Policy Center and conservative-leaning Tax Foundation to assess Ting’s claim. Both said it was off the mark. "What we found is most taxpayers would be getting a tax cut," Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us. That includes most middle-income taxpayers, at least in the short-run, he said. The Tax Policy Center center estimates 91 percent of those who earn between $50,000 and $85,000 would receive a tax cut averaging about $900 in 2018, Sammartino said. Seven percent in this group would see their taxes go up, he said, while the rest would see their taxes remain the same. Additionally, 93 percent of Americans who earn between $85,000 and $150,000 would experience a tax cut in 2018, an amount averaging $1,800. "We’re just not seeing that in the data," Sammartino said of Ting’s statement that the plan results in "nothing more" than middle class tax increase. "We’re not seeing that it’s a tax increase for most people." "A fairly substantial tax cut for the middle class" Scott Greenberg is a senior analyst at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation. He described the GOP tax plan as "a fairly substantial tax cut for the middle class in the short term. And in the long-term, after many of the provisions in the bill expire (at the end of 2025), the net effect of the tax bill on middle income households will be more or less zero." The Tax Foundation concluded it will amount to tax cut of about 1.7 percent of one’s after-tax income, on average, for the middle quintile of taxpayers, Greenberg said. Meanwhile, the Tax Policy Center found it will amount to nearly the same amount, a tax cut of about 1.6 percent of one’s after-tax income for middle income earners. Greenberg said the plan accomplishes this by lowering rates for several tax brackets, expanding the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Assemblyman Phil Ting / Capital Public Radio file photo Response from Ting When asked about the statement, Ting’s spokeswoman Jessica Duong pointed to news articles that show some in the middle class will see higher taxes under the GOP bill. She did not counter the estimate that most would see a tax cut. "The quote was intended to counter Trump’s claim that "this is going to be one of the great gifts to the middle income people of this country that they’ve ever gotten for Christmas" – it is being sold as a middle-class tax cut but the benefits for such families will expire in 2025 while the corporate tax cuts are permanent," the spokeswoman told us in an email. "Assemblymember Ting’s use of "nothing more" is intended to counter that misleading billing and highlight the fact that the plan currently and purposefully relies on the middle class paying for future tax cut deficits," she added. "Little if anything" We also examined the California Budget and Policy Center’s assessment of the tax plan. The group, considered more liberal leaning, painted a dire picture of the plan’s impact on most taxpayers. It warned in a recent post the plan "would do little if anything for middle- and low-income families across the nation, and especially in California." By scaling back the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, known as the SALT deduction, the plan would "harm many middle-income families." It added that the plan is "clearly tilted to wealthy households and major corporations, while providing very little if any benefit for most middle- and low-income families." National tax experts don’t dispute the wealthy would see larger tax cuts. The top one percent of households by income, for example, would see a tax cut of 3.4 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center. That’s about twice the rate of savings compared with middle class households. The plan cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. California hardships? In California, which has high state and local taxes, the GOP plan is expected to create more financial hardships compared with lower-tax states because it caps state and local income tax deductions. Here’s how Forbes.com explained the changes: "Under the old tax law all property taxes paid to state and local governments could be claimed as an itemized deduction. It was also possible to deduct state and local income or sales taxes. The new law bundles all these so-called "SALT" taxes together and limits the deduction, in total, to $10,000 for both individuals and married couples." "For some homeowners in high-tax areas such as California, $10,000 does not come close to covering their combined property and income tax bills." There’s also a change that affects mortgage interest deductions for homeowners. Under the previous law, homeowners could write off any interest they pay on mortgages up to $1 million. The new law will limit these deductions to mortgages of $750,000 or less. Given the Golden State’s high housing costs, some Californians will be impacted by the new cap. The change, however, impacts new mortgages, not existing ones. Sammartino of the Tax Policy Center told us those factors will would hurt some Californians. Even so, he said, the vast majority of middle class taxpayers in the state will still see a tax cut. "The overall tax cuts might be a little bit less," Sammartino said. "But in general, probably upwards of 85 percent of the middle class or so should see a tax cut in California," for 2018. What happens when the tax cuts expire? While the plan’s corporate tax cuts are permanent, the individual reductions are temporary. The national PolitiFact took a closer look at who would be paying more once the individual tax cuts expire. It found all filers who make $75,000 or less annually will see a tax increase. Some of those are middle-class households. "Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027," according to the PolitiFact analysis. "That’s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average." Republicans hope a future Congress will extend the individual provisions. Experts believe that’s likely, though it’s not guaranteed. Our ruling Democratic Assemblyman Phil Ting recently claimed the GOP tax plan is "nothing more than a middle class tax increase." That doesn’t match up with estimates from the centrist Tax Policy Center and conservative leaning Tax Foundation. They project the plan will result in a tax cut for about 90 percent of middle-income households nationwide in 2018. Those cuts would range from about $900 to $1,800. The remaining middle-income households would see their taxes stay the same or go up. The California Budget and Policy Center, a liberal leaning group, warns the plan will provide little if any help to middle- and low-income earners in high-tax California, given new limits placed on state and local tax deductions. But even with those new caps, plus a change to the mortgage interest deduction, national tax experts told us the vast majority of middle-class Californians -- up to 85 percent -- will still experience a tax cut in the plan’s first year. That could change by 2027 after the individual tax cuts expire, when households who make $75,000 or less are expected to see a tax hike. Congress could extend those cuts, though nothing is guaranteed. There might have been some truth to Ting’s statement had he said the plan was "nothing more than a middle class tax increase" — by 2027, after the cuts expire. But his statement ignores the fact that the vast majority in America’s, and California’s, middle class are expected to get a tax break between now and then. We rate Ting’s claim False.

pomt-14469	Says "Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/02/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-wrongly-says-senate-democratic-leader-har/	In an urgent quest to keep his presidential hopes alive, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, attacked GOP frontrunner Donald Trump from several directions in the run-up to Super Tuesday primary balloting. ABC News This Week host George Stephanopoulos prodded Cruz about his charge that Trump has forsaken conservative principles by expressing a willingness to work with congressional Democrats. "You've been making that point about Donald Trump supporting Democrats for several weeks right now," Stephanopoulos asked Cruz on Feb. 28. "It doesn't seem to be sticking. Why not?" Cruz responded that he’s seen positive movement in the polls during that time, and he charged that Trump would be too quick to compromise on such issues as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Supreme Court nominations and religious liberty. Then he added, "There's a reason (Senate Democratic Leader) Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals. We've had too many deals in Washington." We wondered: Did Reid, one of the fiercest Democratic partisans in Congress, really give his blessing to Trump? The short answer is that he did, but only jokingly. Help PolitiFact raise $15,000 to hire a fact-checker to cover the immigration debate. On Jan. 27 — one day after Trump said he got along well with Reid and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on MSNBC’s Morning Joe — Reid told reporters at an impromptu media availability, "Look, we've gotten along fine," referring to Trump. "With that bunch of people running, I'm kind of pulling for him," Reid said. Reid also said, "Oh, I remember the good old days when he did a fundraiser or two for me." Apparently realizing that his words could be misconstrued, Reid took to the Senate floor in short order, seeking to clarify that he had only been joking about "pulling for" Trump in the presidential race. "There are some things I shouldn’t joke about," Reid said on the floor. "I tried to be funny an hour ago at my weekly stakeout and I guess it wasn’t very funny, at least I don’t think so. The danger Donald Trump’s candidacy poses to our country is not a joke. Since he launched his bid for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump has proven over and over again that he is a hateful demagogue who would do immeasurable damage to our country if elected. I have come to the Senate floor many times to decry his hateful comments. Donald Trump threatens to diminish the integrity of our democracy around the whole world. If he wins the nomination of the Republican Party to run for president of the United States, the Republican Party will never recover from the damage he will inflict on conservatism." This public clarification of Reid’s position isn’t something that Cruz reflected when he made his comments on This Week. (We viewed the video of Cruz’s remarks here and conclude that he seems to be making a serious point about what Reid said, not saying it in a tongue-in-cheek manner.) Cruz also glossed over the fact that Reid said he is "pulling for him," which is not exactly the same as Reid saying Trump is the Republican he "likes best." And Cruz amplified these inaccuracies by saying that the reason for Reid’s seeming warmth to Trump was that Reid felt he could cut deals with him. None of the news accounts we found said that Reid cited a willingness to strike deals as the reason for his purported support of Trump. Deal-making was brought up by Trump, not by Reid. When we checked with Reid’s office, spokesman Adam Jentleson reiterated that the comments Cruz cited on This Week were just a joke. Reid, Jentleson said, "has repeatedly denounced Trump for stoking the fires of racism and resentment and spoken out repeatedly on the floor, including before he said the quote" that Cruz referenced. Indeed, there is ample evidence from both before and after Reid’s comments that the Democratic leader is strongly opposed to Trump’s candidacy. For instance, during a Dec. 8, 2015, floor speech, Reid said, "Donald Trump is standing on the platform of hate," and on Jan. 20, 2016, Reid tweeted that by advancing a bill on refugees, the GOP "is catering to (the) hateful agenda of Donald Trump." Reid added in that tweet that Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim travel to the United States is "reprehensible." Then, in late February, Reid tweeted that "Republicans should think about this: If they follow (Senate Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell's lead, they'll be as responsible as Trump/Cruz for debasement of their Party." When we contacted Cruz’s campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said, "I'll leave it to Sen. Reid to speak the sincerity of his comment, but the takeaway still stands — the Washington establishment recognizes Trump will cut deals with them to further their agenda. That is the very thing Americans are fed up with." Our ruling Cruz said, "Harry Reid, when asked about the Republican field, said the Republican he likes the best is Donald Trump, and he said, because I can work with him. He'll cut deals." Reid did tell reporters that "with that bunch of people running, I'm kind of pulling for" Trump, but he quickly went to the Senate floor to clarify that he had been joking. Indeed, Reid has spoken out forcefully and repeatedly against Trump’s candidacy, both before and after the comments Cruz referenced. And importantly, Reid said nothing about Trump’s willingness to cut deals. We rate Cruz’s statement False.

pomt-00316	"Kavanaugh accuser’s brother’s firm linked to Fusion GPS."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/21/blog-posting/no-christine-blasey-fords-brother-isnt-linked-russ/	Christine Blasey Ford’s brother’s job history from 14 years ago has been pulled into widespread internet speculation about Ford’s accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Ford, a California professor, went public with her accusations against Kavanaugh earlier this week, saying he sexually assaulted her at a party while the two were in high school in the early 1980s. "I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation," Kavanaugh said in a statement. "I did not do this back in high school or at any time." YourNewsWire.com points to Ralph Blasey’s time at the law firm BakerHostetler from 1989 to 2004 as evidence that Ford is somehow linked to the Russia investigation. The blog post was cited in a news release from the conservative legal group Liberty Counsel as a "disturbing fact" that "undermine(s) her story." "Ford has a brother, Ralph Blasey, who worked for BakerHostetler, a law firm that retained Fusion GPS, the infamous DC company that produced the unverified Steele dossier on President Donald Trump and Russia, sparking the Russia investigation," the release states, linking to YourNewsWire.com. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This theory that somehow Ford is linked to the Russia investigation through her brother’s old job comes from the fact that in 2013, nine years after Blasey left BakerHostetler, the firm hired Fusion GPS, a consulting firm, to assist with a Russian money-laundering investigation. In 2015, Fusion GPS subcontracted with Christopher Steele, a British intelligence officer to produce the Russian dossier. Fusion GPS has said the two cases were unrelated. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Ford’s lawyers said she had "been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats." They said as a result of those threats, her family relocated out of their home. The letter also said Ford’s email had been hacked and she had been impersonated online. Our ruling Ford’s brother, Ralph Blasey, worked for a law firm that worked with Fusion GPS nine years after he left the company. Fusion GPS’s work on the Russian dossier began more than a decade after Blasey left BakerHostetler. While it’s accurate to say Blasey worked for BakerHostetler — he says that clearly on his LinkedIn — it is ridiculously wrong to somehow link her brother’s past employment to Fusion GPS’s work in investigating Donald Trump’s ties to Russia.

"Trump warns Russia over Jehovah’s Witnesses ban and urges members to seek asylum in the U.S.," reads the headline on an undated story on States-TV.com. The post first appeared on or around April 24, 2017, on States-TV.com, HoustonChronicle-TV.com and Fox-News24.com. Facebook users flagged it as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to clear fake news from users’ news feeds. The post is keyed to a real event: Russia’s Supreme Court banned the religious organization on April 20, labeling the group as a danger for "extremist activities." The assets of the St. Petersburg headquarters and almost 400 chapters were designated state property. Its literature and website have also been banned. From there, the story devolved into fairytale, claiming Trump warned that the move "is contrary to the constitution of the land of the Russian Federation." "I request you to reverse the decision immediately before I use your own constitution against you," Trump is quoted. He also is credited as saying Jehovah’s Witness could find freedom in this country. "As this is an infringement of your fundamental human right, I therefore urge you to seek asylum in the United States until your rights are fully reinstated," he said, according to the post. The problem is, there is no record Trump said any of these things. Aside from a few examples of this same post being on multiple websites, we couldn’t find any official record of him personally addressing the subject at all. We reached out to a White House spokesman to confirm this but didn’t receive a response. State Department spokesman Mark Toner did release a statement on April 20 saying that the United States was "extremely concerned by the Russian government's actions targeting and repressing members of religious minorities, including Jehovah's Witnesses, under the pretense of combating extremism." Toner also noted that religious freedom was critical to society. "All religious minorities should be able to enjoy freedom of religion and assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Russian Federation's constitution," he said. But there’s no mention of Trump making any statement, and we couldn’t find one elsewhere. Reposts have circulated of the country’s 175,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses being harassed by Russian police since the ruling. Fox-News24.com is a url that attempts to mimic Fox News, but has no connection to the cable news network. The same goes for HoustonChronicle-TV.com, which mimics the real newspaper’s name but doesn’t look to have affiliation. All three of the sites are filled with the same kind of sponsored content ads endemic to fake news sites. But even though this story appears to be bogus, it’s difficult to fully determine the point of the websites, because they do contain some legitimate news articles. Fox-News24.com, for example, features one article about Education Secretary Betsy DeVos saying she wouldn’t mind shutting down the Education Department. It’s copied practically word-for-word from a Feb. 17 story from U.S. News & World Report. Fox-News24.com administrators have hidden the registration of the website, which was only registered on March 20. There is no contact information available. The same goes for the other two websites we’ve noted. The story said that Trump warned Russia for banning Jehovah’s Witnesses, and offered a safe haven for Russians who wanted to come to America. The State Department did decry Russia’s ruling, but there’s no evidence Trump weighed in. We rate the statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-08310	Says four Democratic state senators voted to "raise taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month so freeloaders can get free state-run health care."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/30/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/group-says-four-wisconsin-senators-voted-raise-tax/	Before the federal law derided by critics as "ObamaCare" overshadowed earlier attempts at health care reform, a proposal for universal health care in Wisconsin gained national attention. "Perhaps the boldest move on health care reform ever in a state," declared the Progressive States Network, a left-leaning public policy organization, after the state Senate approved "Healthy Wisconsin" in 2007. "Wow, is ‘free’ health care expensive," countered a Wall Street Journal editorial headlined "Cheese Headcases." "Healthy Wisconsin" did not become law, but it has returned to the spotlight in the 2010 elections for the state Senate in TV ads produced by Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. The state’s largest business group is targeting four Democratic senators in key districts: Jim Sullivan of Wauwatosa, John Lehman of Racine, Pat Kreitlow of Chippewa Falls and Robert Jauch of Poplar. The ads vary a bit, sometimes doubling up the targets, but all follow the same theme. "Do you refuse to get a job? Looking for a free ride?" a narrator asks in one of the ads. "Well, Jim Sullivan says, Come to Wisconsin. No job? No problem! Don’t pay taxes? Don’t worry about it!" Then comes the punch line: "Jim Sullivan’s been working hard to raise taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month so freeloaders can get free state-run health care." Whoa. For some workers, that’s a car payment or two worth of higher taxes every month. And "freeloaders" is, well, a pretty loaded word. So, let’s see what Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is talking about. The ads cite votes by the four Democrats for Senate Bill 40, which was the Senate version of the 2007-’09 state budget and included "Healthy Wisconsin." The proposal would have provided health coverage to nearly all state residents. Senate Bill 40 died after being approved by the Senate. It faced opposition from Assembly Republicans and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who said at the time he had to live in the "real world" of ideas that could become law. Let’s examine the two parts of the major claim in the ads: The Senate Democrat’s plan would have raised "taxes on Wisconsin workers by another $510 a month ..." The proposal was to be funded through a payroll tax. The average monthly cost would have been $370 for employers and $140 for employees, or a total of $510, according to the Senate Democrats’ summary of the plan. When asked why the ads claim the full tax would have been picked up by workers, WMC policy analyst R.J. Pirlot told PolitiFact Wisconsin: "It ultimately comes out of the worker’s pocket." That’s one view of it. But clearly $510 per month would not have been deducted from paychecks, as the ads suggest. Now the second part. " ... so freeloaders can get free state-run health care." "Freeloaders" means people who don’t work, said WMC spokesman Jim Pugh. Indeed, WMC’s ad against Jauch -- unlike the ones against Sullivan, Lehman and Kreitlow -- is explicit on that point. That ad says "Healthy Wisconsin" was "like ObamaCare, only worse. It would cost us $510 a month, but it’s free for people who move here and refuse to work." Is that right? Only to a point. "Healthy Wisconsin" would have covered state residents and out-of-state residents working in Wisconsin, except those already covered by plans such as Medicare, Medicaid and BadgerCare, according to the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Unemployed people would have been eligible for health care under the proposal. So would new unemployed residents, after living in Wisconsin for one year -- although that waiting period would have been waived for pregnant women. Let’s punch the clock on this item. With a focus on key state Senate seats, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is airing ads against four Democrats for their votes on a failed universal health care plan. Citing a $510 a month cost, the ads overstate how much the plan would have raised payroll taxes on workers. As for the second half of the charge -- that "freeloaders" would get free care -- unemployed Wisconsin residents would have qualified, as long as they’d been state residents for at least a year.

This was a variation on a few memes we’ve checked previously -- that nine out of the 10 poorest states are red states (we rated this Mostly True) and that Republican-leaning states get more in federal dollars than they pay in taxes (also Mostly True). While the meme’s suggestion that "Republican policies" are causing poverty is too subjective a question to be fact-checked, we decided to take a closer look at the set-up to the claim -- that "97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states." First, we’ll explain our methodology. To determine the nation’s 100 poorest counties, we downloaded data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. This data covers five years ending in 2012, and includes more than 3,000 counties and county equivalents (such as Louisiana parishes). This data enabled us to rank-order these jurisdictions based on two commonly used measurements -- median income, and percentage of the population in poverty. As for determining whether a state is "red" or "blue," we decided to define it by whether the state voted for President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. This means we counted North Carolina and Indiana as red states, since Obama lost them in 2012 after winning them in 2008. (Though either way, the differences would have been marginal.) So how did the data turn out? For median income, we found that 95 of the 100 poorest counties were located in red states. Here are the 10 poorest, all of them in red states: 1. Owsley County, Ky. 2. Jefferson County, Miss. 3. Wolfe County, Ky. 4. Brooks County, Texas 5. McCreary County, Ky. 6. Hudspeth County, Texas 7. Hancock County, Tenn. 8. Jackson County, Ky. 9. Clay County, Ky. 10. Holmes County, Miss. For percentage of residents in poverty, we found that 93 of the 100 poorest counties were in red states. Here are the 10 with the highest poverty rates, all of them in red states: 1. Shannon County, S.D. 2. Clay County, Ga. 3. East Carroll Parish, La. 4. Sioux County, N.D. 5. Todd County, S.D. 6. Hudspeth County, Texas 7. Holmes County, Miss. 8. Corson County, S.D. 9. Wolfe County, Ky. 10. Humphreys County, Miss. So there are some differences between the most recent Census data and what the meme said, but they are pretty small. Numerically, we don’t have much to quibble with. Our bigger question concerns whether it’s significant that a lot of poor counties are located in red states. There’s reason for at least a bit of skepticism. For starters, the list is dominated by rural areas. Generally speaking, rural areas have a lower cost of living, so the small income you make in a poor, rural Texas county is going to go further than it would if you lived in a poor, urban area like Detroit or Camden, N.J. This raises questions about how comparatively disadvantaged poor Americans are in rural and urban areas. Also, rural areas are areas where Republicans tend to do well electorally. By contrast, impoverished areas of big cities are big enough population-wise to be balanced by more affluent neighborhoods, and these poor urban areas are often (though not always) in blue states. It’s also worth pointing out that many of the counties on the list are located in Appalachia, particularly in such states as Kentucky, West Virginia, Mississippi and Georgia. That’s a region that has suffered economically for generations -- long predating the time when Republicans took over from Democrats in most elected offices. In Appalachia, "it’s clear there’s a regional problem, born of isolation, geographic and political; exploitation, of timber and coal; and poor education," said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky. Finally, there’s an eccentricity that shaped both of the top-100 lists. Each is dominated by three states: Texas, Georgia and Kentucky. What ties together these three states? They have a lot of counties. In fact, these three states rank first, second and third on the list of states that have the most counties. Texas has 254, Georgia 159 and Kentucky 120. This means that these three states have lots of rural, small-population counties, so they take up a disproportionate share of the spots on these lists. On each list, these three states collectively account for more than 40 percent of the counties listed. Importantly, each of these three states are red states. If some of the bigger blue states had been sliced into as many counties as Texas, Georgia and Kentucky were, some of those blue-state counties might have been poor and rural, and that could have changed the complexion of the list. As it is, blue states tend to have smaller numbers of counties. New York has 62, California has 57, Washington state has 39, Oregon has 36, New Jersey has 21 and Massachusetts has just 14. Our ruling The meme said that "97 percent of the 100 poorest counties in America are in red states." According to the most recent data, that’s a few percentage points high, but not by much. However, measuring a county’s lack of affluence this way skews the map of poorest places toward rural states (which tend to be red) and away from big cities (which tend to be blue). This undercuts the simplicity of the meme’s political message. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06339	"The problem with invasive species today in the Great Lakes isn’t ballast water."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/09/steve-latourette/ballast-water-no-longer-key-invasive-species-great/	For the past several months, GOP Rep. Steve LaTourette has been weighted down in a congressional dispute over ballast water on the Great Lakes. Invasive species, like zebra mussels, round gobies and bloody red shrimp, have hitchhiked in ballast water that ships take on for stability in one body of water, and discharge elsewhere. The stowaways crowd out native species, cause structural damage, and spread disease. Everyone wants to crack down on invasive species, but LaTourette says the state of New York has gone too far by imposing new ballast water regulations on shippers that are so strict they can’t be met by current technology. "The problem with invasive species today in the Great Lakes isn’t ballast water," LaTourette said. He said he has talked with many people about the issue, including longshoremen, Canadian officials and others on the St. Lawrence Seaway, and noted that the U.S., Canadian and state governments have worked hard to improve ballast water treatment practices. At the moment, he said the Asian Carp is the lakes’ biggest invasive species threat. An electric barrier has been built to keep them from spreading into the lakes from the Mississippi River system. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out LaTourette’s claim. LaTourette, from Bainbridge Township in Northeast Ohio, and other foes of the new rules argue the scheduled imposition of the New York regulations in 2013 will effectively shut down the St. Lawrence Seaway, which allows ships from the Atlantic Ocean to reach the Great Lakes, costing thousands of shipping jobs. This summer, LaTourette tried to pressure New York to change its rules by securing language in a spending bill that would block the state from getting any Environmental Protection Agency money until its ballast water policy is altered. He and GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs, a fellow Ohioan from Holmes County, also co-sponsored a measure, which is now part of a Coast Guard funding bill, that would set a nationwide ballast water policy instead of letting states do it themselves. "Vessels involved in interstate and foreign commerce are mobile and cannot be expected to comply with potentially scores of inconsistent state requirements as they navigate from one jurisdiction to the next," Gibbs argued on the House of Representatives floor. "These inconsistent state requirements will impose serious economic burdens on interstate and foreign commerce." Not everyone shares the views of LaTourette and Gibbs. Several legislators stuck up for New York, arguing that states should be permitted to establish more stringent standards in their own waters. The amendments they suggested were defeated when the House voted. PolitiFact Ohio checked with LaTourette’s staff about his claim. They referred us to a study produced by the Canadian government’s fisheries and oceans division, which says that since current ballast water regulations were introduced in 2006, "no new invasive species attributed to ballast water release and transoceanic shipping in general have been recorded in the Great Lakes." Because invasive plants and animals from foreign freshwater ports are most likely to thrive in the Great Lakes, ships that from abroad that travel to the Great Lakes must exchange fresh water in their ballast tanks with salt water while they are still in the ocean. That kills off any freshwater species that sneak into the ballast tanks. Marine organisms that enter the ballast tanks in the ocean don’t survive when they’re released into the Great Lakes’ fresh water. Canadian regulations also require ships to rinse out their empty ballast tanks with salt water in the middle of the ocean to kill any lingering freshwater organisms. Jordan Lubetkin, a spokesman for the National Wildlife Federation, is fighting LaTourette’s efforts to relax New York’s ballast water rules, contending the bill is a sop to the shipping industry that would leave the Great Lakes vulnerable to future invasions. But he does not dispute the study’s findings. While progress has been made to prevent ballast water from spreading invasive species between water bodies, Lubetkin says more should be done. He noted that more than 65 percent of the aquatic invasive species which got into the Great Lakes since the St. Lawrence Seaway’s 1959 opening arrived in ballast water. "One must only look at how one single invader—the zebra mussel—entered the Great Lakes through ballast water and disrupted the Lakes from top to bottom to understand that we need a zero tolerance policy toward new invaders," Lubetkin said. "The people, communities and businesses that have picked up the tab for the biological pollution dumped into the Great Lakes deserve a solution that offers the strongest water quality protections to protect our Lakes, jobs, health and quality of life." Although invasive species are a serious problem in the Great Lakes, LaTourette does have research to back his assertion that they haven’t been spreading through ballast water. On the Truth-O-Meter, LaTourette’s claim rates True.	None	Steve LaTourette	None	None	None	2011-11-09T06:00:00	2011-11-04	['None']
pomt-03985	Says, "Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/feb/11/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-says-domestic-abuse-against-women-has/	Violence - or the potential for violence - is everywhere. It’s the reason we have police and laws, jails and federal programs to study the causes and suggest responses. It’s the reason, too, that Congress passes laws to address crime in all its facets. One of those is the Violence Against Women Act, which is intended to protect women from domestic abuse and violence. It provides federal dollars for an array of programs to achieve that goal. Oregon, for example, collected $9.4 million in 2012 for programs to protect women from violence. The law was first passed in 1994 and easily renewed in 2000 and 2005 by lopsided majorities. But it was allowed to lapse in 2011 after a partisan Congress couldn’t reach agreement. (Partisanship in Congress? Shocking, we know.) Now it’s back and in an effort to build momentum and the votes to renew it, supporters like Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., have been talking about the law’s benefits. Here’s what Merkley said Feb. 7 during a conference call with reporters: "Since 1994 when VAWA was first passed, incidents of domestic violence have dropped more than 50 percent." That seems to be a pretty strong selling point and as the bill moves toward a final vote in the Senate it’s something that will be repeated and emphasized during debate. But is it true? First, we need a quick fly-by of the law and what it provides. The law, known by the shorthand VAWA, first passed in 1994 and was written by then senator and now Vice President Joe Biden. It acknowledged domestic violence and sexual assault as crimes, and provided federal resources to encourage community-coordinated responses to combating violence. When it was re-authorized in 2000 lawmakers expanded the definition of crime to include dating violence and stalking. Its subsequent reauthorization in 2005 created new programs to meet the emerging needs of communities working to prevent violence. Until it expired in 2011, the law was expansive and reached into every corner of the country. (Some funding continued into 2012.) Among other things, it provided grants to states and local law enforcement to beef up enforcement as well as money to prosecutors to focus on gender-based crime. Included in the array of programs and assistance, VAWA provided money for direct services for victims of sexual assault and for things like transitional housing and legal assistance. According to Merkley, all those programs made a difference. Which brings us back to his claim that since it was first enacted domestic violence has fallen 50 percent. Another fortunate development when it comes to crime is that governments at all levels but especially the federal government go to great lengths to quantify, parse and sub-total crime. Data abounds. It’s also unambiguous. "From 1994 to 2010, the overall rate of intimate partner violence in the United States declined by 64 percent, from 9.8 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older to 3.6 per 1,000," the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in November 2012. The report notes that over that same period "4 in 5 victims of intimate partner violence were female." A report by the National Network to End Domestic Violence, an interest group focusing on the issue, comes to a similar conclusion. "The rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence against women has decreased by 63 percent and the number of women killed by an intimate partner has decreased 24 percent," between 1994 and 2010. The group connects the numbers directly to the VAWA, saying the law "has changed the way federal, tribal, state and local entities respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking." Surveys by the American Bar Association and other independent groups had similar findings. That’s a lot of scholarship and paper, sponsored, collected and analyzed by federal and independent researchers. And while the results don’t perfectly align, all agree that the incidence of domestic abuse has dropped by more than 50 percent since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994. You can quibble about the minor differences but not the accuracy of Merkley’s statement. We rate this claim: True.	None	Jeff Merkley	None	None	None	2013-02-11T16:06:42	2013-02-07	['None']
pomt-12701	"And this would be the first year, if everything holds true, we will spend over $10 billion of our state budget on Medicaid out of the $28 billion budget."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/mar/12/caleb-rowden/rowden-mostly-right-about-medicaid-costs/	A hot-button topic in Missouri this year has been the state budget, a large part of which goes to social services, primarily Medicaid. With more budget cuts looming, funding these services may be hard to maintain. That’s what state Sen. Caleb Rowden suggested in mid-January before Gov. Eric Greitens unveiled his proposed state budget. At a legislative breakfast Jan. 20, Rowden said, "This would be the first year, if everything holds true, we will spend over $10 billion of our state budget on Medicaid out of the $28 billion budget." Rowden then said maintaining this current level of spending for social services is not an option given the revenue shortfalls officials expect. Ten billion dollars is a massive amount of money, and the figure piqued our interest. We wanted to know if this level of Medicaid spending could be correct. Where does the state gets its money for Medicaid? Before diving deeper into Rowden’s claim, it’s important to get some background on the Medicaid program. Medicaid is designed to provide health coverage for lower-income families, people with disabilities, senior citizens, pregnant women and newborns, blind and visually impaired, uninsured women, families, kids, and women with breast or cervical cancer. As of November 2016, 69 million people nationwide were covered through Medicaid. Missouri disperses Medicaid to participating residents through its MO HealthNet program under the Department of Social Services. A document by the Missouri Budget Project explains how Missouri funds Medicaid. The majority of funding for Medicaid — 83 percent — comes from the federal government through two programs. One program called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP, matches federal government dollars to state dollars spent on health care services based on a percentage rate. Missouri's FMAP rate for fiscal year 2018 is 63.21 percent, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. This means that for every dollar Missouri spends on health care — not just Medicaid — the federal government gives $1.72. Of the total money Missouri receives from the FMAP program, only a certain amount goes to Medicaid. The rest goes toward other health care services the state provides. Fifty-one percent of Missouri's Medicaid spending is funded through FMAP. The other program — Federal Reimbursement Allowance — along with other capital reserves, covers another 32 percent of Missouri’s spending on Medicaid. Missouri has been participating in this program for 25 years. So this leaves Missouri picking up only 17 percent of its own Medicaid bill. This money comes from collected state revenue. Dan Haug, acting budget director for the state, told us in a phone call that he expects Medicaid to cost the state $10.21 billion in the coming fiscal year. This would make Rowden’s statement true, but we wanted to check the budget to see where all the Medicaid money went. Figuring out Medicaid Finding Medicaid spending in the state budget is complicated. The bulk of Medicaid spending falls under the Department of Social Services. In the last fiscal year, the state approved $9.2 billion for the DSS, $7.7 billion of which went toward Medicaid. At first glance, this seems like this is the total budget for Medicaid in the state. There are really no other places in the budget where Medicaid is clearly defined as an expense. So Rowden’s claim about the Medicaid budget is false, right? Not so fast. In fact, Medicaid money is spent by more agencies than just the DSS. It is used for other services spread throughout the state budget, most notably in the Department of Mental Health. Traci Gleason, the director of communications and public engagement at the Missouri Budget Project, confirmed that nearly 20 percent, or $2 billion, of the Medicaid budget goes toward mental health services, driving the total budget of Medicaid closer to that $10 billion figure. Where does the rest of Medicaid spending go? Even an expert such as Gleason said that’s very tricky to determine. Part of the reason for this is because portions of the Medicaid budget are listed as MO HealthNet, which is the health care system Missouri switched to in 2007. Through the MO HealthNet name, a series of supplemental appropriations sections are added at the bottom of the state budget document. Some of the services funded through supplemental appropriations, such as pharmacies, physicians and premium services, fall under the Medicaid budget. When you add all the supplemental appropriations together for services that fall under Medicaid, it comes out to $10,023,904,918. While this falls short of Haug’s estimate, it does make Rowden’s statement about the Medicaid budget correct. "It’s really hard to drill down (the Medicaid spending) because it’s spread over all sorts of different departments and programs," Gleason said. "Overall, though, Sen. Rowden is correct with his totals." Nevertheless, because the state is responsible for funding only 17 percent of the total on Medicaid, the total amount Missouri will spend is $1.7 billion from state revenue. Our ruling Rowden was trying to illustrate that Medicaid spending has reached out-of-control levels. According to Greitens' budget recommendations for fiscal year 2018, the budget for Medicaid has gone up over $1 billion in the last three years and now takes up approximately 37 percent of the state budget. Despite the growing concern from Republicans on the cost of Medicaid spending, Greitens has recommended $10.7 billion for the service for fiscal year 2018, an increase of over $500 million from fiscal year 2017. However, it’s important to note that "we" — as in the state of Missouri — don’t directly fund the entire $10 billion. Because of the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage and the Federal Reimbursement Allowance programs, the state only has to spend approximately $1.7 billion of state revenue on Medicaid. So while Medicaid spending will exceed $10 billion of the nearly $28 billion budget, not all of the money is coming directly from the state. Rowden’s statement is accurate but needs clarification.

pomt-07280	"Unions don’t have to comply with Obamacare."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/23/crossroads-gps/unions-dont-have-comply-obamacare-says-crossroads-/	An ad from the Republican controlled campaign group Crossroads GPS asserts that unions are exempt from the new health care law as a political favor from President Barack Obama. The ad shows union leaders and Obama speaking in favor of health care reform, then shows a Fox News anchor asking, "Is the Obama administration exempting some from complying with the new health care law as a political favor?" Video shows Obama at a political rally, shouting, "Because we fought together, we had worked together, they walked doors (door-to-door) for me, they made phone calls for me, they turned out the vote for me." Text on the screen then says, "Over 185 union waivers. All exempt from Obamacare mandate. If unions don’t have to comply with Obamacare, why should we?" We spent a good bit of time looking into this claim, because it’s based on some very wonky details of the new health care law, things like annual benefit limits, phase-ins to 2014 and rules advertised in the Federal Register. We’re going to explain all those details momentarily, but we’ll start by giving you the bottom line: Unions do have to obey the mandates of the health care law like any other organization. And if there’s concrete evidence that they’re getting special treatment, we didn’t find it. For simplicity’s sake, we’re going to start at the very beginning, before the passage of the health care law. Insurance limits and the new law Prior to passage of the health care law, insurance companies could place limits on what they would be willing to pay for a person’s health care per year. A typical annual limit for someone with pretty good insurance might be $1 million, but it could be lower, sometimes much lower. If you were never sick, you might not be aware that the limit existed. But it would be a different story if you were sick, particularly if you suffered from something that was expensive to treat, like cancer. One in 10 cancer patients, for example, exhaust benefit limits and have to find more insurance or pay for treatment themselves, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Low-wage workers were particularly vulnerable to plans with low annual limits. In some cases, annual payouts would be as low as $2,000. Those types of plans are often called "mini-meds," and consumer advocates say they’re almost always a bad deal. The health care law phases out annual benefit limits so that people wouldn’t be caught without coverage, according to the HHS. The phase-out started this year, with new rules saying that all insurance plans must offer at least $750,000 in payouts per year. The number goes up every year so that by 2014 no caps at all will be allowed. Last year, though, companies started complaining, saying that if they had to meet the new requirements, they would either have to increase premiums paid by their employees or end coverage altogether. The Obama administration didn’t want that to happen, so they started granting waivers to the new rule. The waivers would be granted to health plans annually until 2014, according to the HHS, when people will be able to buy standard health insurance policies using new state-based "exchanges." That same year, low-wage workers will be eligible for tax credits to help them buy insurance. "It is essential that we make sure that Americans who have insurance today – even if that insurance is highly limited – can keep that coverage until reforms take effect that will increase their ability to choose among comprehensive, affordable insurance options in 2014," said Steven Larsen, who oversees the waiver process, in testimony before Congress in March. So far, employers like McDonald’s, Jack in the Box, Cracker Barrel and O’Reilly Auto Parts have successfully applied for waivers for their health plans. Other approved applicants include Sunview Vineyards of California, Securitas Security Services USA, Mesa Air Group and Dish Network. (See all the approved applications here.) There are also several union health plans, which are the basis for the claims in the Crossroads ad. We contacted the HHS and asked for the number of waivers they’ve granted so far. A spokeswoman told us that they have approved 1,372 applications and denied 92. Of the approved applications, 27 represent unions and another 315 represent plans jointly managed by unions and employers. Even if you took the broadest definition possible, counting all the joint plans as union plans, only 25 percent of the waivers have gone to unions. The rest have gone to plans offered by employers, insurance companies and other non-union groups. To be clear, though, the waivers do not exempt these groups from the health care law. They only allow them to continue offering their current health plans with annual limits until 2014. We should note that some Republicans are firm in their opposition to the waivers. Two congressional hearings have been held on why waivers are being offered and if the process is transparent. A law firm for Crossroads GPS has filed a federal lawsuit against HHS, claiming that the agency has not responded quickly enough to its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for information about how the waivers are being awarded. The lawsuit says it's seeking "the criteria to be applied by HHS in deciding whether to grant or deny applications for waiver of the annual limit requirements." On its website, though, HHS said it approves waivers if "a premium increase is large or if a significant number of enrollees would lose access to their current plan because the coverage would not be offered in the absence of a waiver." Special treatment? Consumer advocates, we should note, have mixed feelings about the waivers. "Our concern with the waiver process in general is that they’re targeted at the very type of health policy that health care reform was meant to get rid of -- extremely low-benefit policies that cost consumers more than they’re worth," said Carmen Balber, the Washington director of the nonprofit group Consumer Watchdog. In fact, we wondered why unions would need waivers, because unions have a reputation for offering good health care benefits. The experts we spoke with said it could be one of two scenarios. In some cases, unions, like companies, may offer policies that come in just under the $750,000 limit. In other cases, union workers get limited benefits while their private counterparts get none. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) offered the example of janitors in Houston who are covered by a health plan with an exemption. "It’s important to remember that the coverage we are talking about are low-cost plans that cover low-wage workers, some of whom have never had health care coverage in their lives," said the union in a statement, after we asked about the matter. But we can’t say for sure which plans might fit which category, because HHS hasn’t released every detail about the plans that are getting these waivers. The agency releases information about the company offering the plan, how many workers are covered, and the dates of application and approval. But it doesn’t list what the annual limits are or other details of the health plans. When we asked Crossroads GPS about the ad, a spokesman cited a lack of transparency in the approval process and claimed that a disproportionate number of waivers were going to unions, because only 11.9 percent of the country is unionized. The Obama administration "is in the very least giving the appearance that waivers are going to those with political connections," said spokesman Jonathan Collegio. But Balber said she saw no evidence that unions were receiving special treatment. "Pretty much anyone who applied, received them," she said. "The claim that this was special treatment falls a little flat. As a consumer organization, we think the waivers were granted too broadly, but HHS was being consistent." We also reviewed the most recent congressional testimony on how the waivers were granted. None of the witnesses provided evidence that there was special treatment. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., questioned the administrator of the waivers on the point, specifically asking about complaints from Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Cummings: "Now some critics have suggested that the process by which annual limit waivers have been issued is biased and favors certain groups such as unions. For example, the February 10th, 2010, letter to the secretary, Chairman Issa made this statement, and I quote, ‘The current process gives credence to the perception that bureaucrats are picking winners and losers in a politicized environment where the winners are favored constituencies of the administration.’ Is that accurate?" Larsen: "That's not true. We do not favor any particular type of applicant, or any applicant from a particular sector, and we've applied the standards that we set out fairly across all the applicants." Cummings: "Is political support for the Obama administration or health care reform a factor your office uses in evaluating applications for annual limit waivers?" Larsen: "It is not." Cummings: "And you understand you're under oath?" Larsen: "I do, sir." Our ruling In ruling on this statement, we understand that the Obama administration would hardly admit to it if it were giving unions special treatment. But looking at the numbers of waivers that have been given to both union and non-union groups, we don’t see any pattern that would support a case for special treatment. The number of waivers are a small sample of all health plans, and many more waivers were given to big companies and corporations. We looked for additional information or evidence on this point and didn’t find it. But there are additional problems with the ad. The ad doesn’t mention that the waivers only apply to annual coverage limits, that they’re intended to be in place only until 2014 and that many for-profit companies have received the same waivers. It gives the impression that unions are entirely exempt from the health care law, which they are not. Because the ad gives the impression that unions are exempt from the entire law, and because it’s evidence for special treatment is so thin, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06805	Says Democratic state Sen. Jim Holperin "voted against a property tax freeze" in 2009 and then voted for a "$1.5 billion property tax hike."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/12/kim-simac/recall-challenger-kim-simac-says-state-sen-jim-hol/	When Democrats controlled the Wisconsin Legislature in 2009, state Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) joined a one-vote majority in favor of the two-year state budget. Now that vote is providing fodder for Republican challenger Kim Simac as she tries to knock off Holperin in the Aug. 16, 2011, recall election. Holperin was among the Democrats who faced recalls over their quorum-blocking flight to Illinois to protest Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed changes to collective bargaining. Simac and conservatives in the other recalls have sought to contrast Walker’s austere increases in taxes and fees ($88 million) with then-Gov. Jim Doyle’s bill two years earlier ($1.9 billion in net tax and fee increases). Simac put her own twist on it, going beyond those tax and fee increases when she criticized Holperin for raising local property taxes as part of the same budget vote in 2009. "In 2009, (Holperin) voted against a property tax freeze. That same year he also voted for a $1.5 billion property tax hike," Simac said in a July letter on her website. "The consequences of Jim Holperin’s reckless votes have been devastating to our economy and our seniors." Did Holperin really vote to kill a freeze and raise the burden on property taxpayers by that hefty figure? It’s an interesting claim, because politicians at the state level take credit when they have an impact on holding down local taxes, and they get some blame for increases. In reality, state lawmakers don’t set local property taxes; they’re voted on at the local level. But state budget decisions -- in part through limits or "freezes" on local taxes -- can greatly influence to what extent local schools and governments have to rely on local taxes. The first blow in the one-two punch from Simac said Holperin opposed a tax freeze. Her campaign, though, could not provide any evidence of a bill or budget amendment related to a tax freeze. Nor could we turn up any evidence after checking news stories and Senate amendments. Holperin did, of course, vote against the Walker budget in 2011 that included a property tax freeze. So that gets her off to a false start. Now let’s look at the number. Simac spokesman Matt Capristo pointed us to an April 2009 Legislative Fiscal Bureau report as backup for the $1.5 billion figure. Every two years after lawmakers pass a budget, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates how much local governments might raise property taxes given the changes lawmakers made to state aid, limits on local taxes and tax credits. Property-value growth and many other variables factor in as well. But we couldn’t find the $1.5 billion figure in the report. The section cited by the campaign estimates an increase of $478 million for 2010 over 2009 and another $528 million on top of that in 2011 over 2010. The report offers no sum for the two-year total increase. Adding the two yearly increases means taxes in 2011 would be about $1 billion higher than in 2009. That’s not $1.5 billion. Simac argues it’s more accurate to compare each year’s tax total to the base year of 2009. Here’s the math: The first year is a $478 million boost, and the second-year increase is more than $1 billion if you compare taxes in 2011 to what they were two years earlier ($478 million plus $528 million). Add the $1 billion-plus to the $478 million and that would reach $1.5 billion. Who’s right? It depends on what question you want to answer. Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the average taxpayer looks at it year-to-year and would probably say it’s up $1 billion in two years. But it’s true, he added, that compared to the base year, $1.5 billion more was to be collected. So in making the claim, Simac picked a way to look at it that generated the highest possible number. There are other issues to consider -- with either number. The number from two years ago was a prediction. So we now know how much local governments and schools actually raised property taxes. The figure, according to the fiscal bureau, is about 40 percent lower than the initial projections. That calculation comes from numbers that were publicly available in June 2011 -- a month before Simac made her statement. Of course when Holperin voted on the budget, the estimate was much higher. So, we think it’s fair to use the original estimate as a benchmark for what Holperin was willing to support. Let’s see what we have: Simac said Holperin voted against a property tax freeze and voted for "a $1.5 billion property tax hike." She offers no evidence there was any vote on a freeze. And we could find none ourselves. On the second part of her claim, Simac cites a report that on its face does not back up the $1.5 billion figure. She uses math that an average taxpayer probably would not, but officials say it’s one way to tally up the impact. We think it’s somewhat misleading, but not totally out of bounds, to say Holperin "voted" for a property tax increase. After all, state actions have a big factor in local tax levies and lawmakers know the estimated impact on local levies when they approve a budget. And Holperin voted for the 2009-11 budget, the one in question. We rate Simac’s claim Mostly False.	None	Kim Simac	None	None	None	2011-08-12T14:56:57	2011-07-21	['Jim_Holperin']
pomt-03638	The U.S. Army had a training program that put "evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons in the same category of religious extremism as we do al-Qaida."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/may/03/randy-forbes/forbes-says-army-training-program-listed-evangelic/	During a recent budget hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, accused the Obama administration of waging war against religious expression in the military. "I believe the impact of this administration’s fiscal cuts to our national security are unwise and will have long-lasting repercussions," he told U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel on April 11. "But I also believe this administration’s attacks on faith, religious freedom and religious liberty in the military are also unwise and will have long-lasting repercussions," the congressman said. Forbes, who is founder and chairman of the 94-member Congressional Prayer Caucus, cited several examples that have convinced him religious expression by service members is being suppressed. One, in particular, stood out. "We’ve had a training program, which I have given you a copy of, where we list evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons in the same category of religious extremism as we do al-Qaida," Forbes told Hagel. The statement gained Forbes interviews on WAVY-TV10 in Norfolk and on Fox News, which put up a screen headline saying, "Military calls evangelicals ‘terrorists.’" So we decided to check whether the armed forces had such a training program. Sergio Gor, Forbes’ spokesman, sent us news stories that ran around April 5 in The Washington Times, The Daily Mail in London, The Navy News and the Catholic News Agency. They concerned an offensive computer slide on Page 24 of a U.S. Army Reserve training presentation titled "Extremism and Extremist Organizations." Gor also sent us a picture of the slide, which in blue capital letters at the top, is titled "Religious Extremism." Seventeen groups are listed underneath. Evangelical Christianity topped the list, followed by Muslim Brotherhood, the most powerful political group in Egypt. Beside each listing, the slide notes the nation and the religion that spawns the supposedly extremist group. The list includes Catholicism, ultra-orthodox Judaism and Sunni Islam in addition to the Ku Klux Klan and several groups that are recognized as terrorist organizations by the U.S. State Department: al-Qaida, Hamas in Palestine, Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines and the Kahane movement in Israel. Contrary to Forbes’ statement, mainstream Mormons are not cited for extremism. But a split-off polygamist sect, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, is. Forbes, at the hearing and in TV interviews, gave the impression that the training materials were widely used and sanctioned by the Army. He told Fox News, "They’re training troops before the go to Afghanistan, and they were training them that evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons were in the same category with Hamas, al-Qaida and the Ku Klux Klan, and that’s just appalling." But there’s another side to this story that Forbes didn’t mention, a part that was well-documented in the news stories his office sent to us. The offending slide was used a year ago at a briefing held for an Army Reserves Unit in Pennsylvania. An Army spokesman said the person who created and presented the slideshow, whom the service will not identify by name, was not a "subject matter expert." The Army said the presenter, upon receiving a single complaint, apologized and deleted the slide. "The slide was not produced by the Army and certainly does not reflect our policy or doctrine," the Army said in a statement. "It was produced without anyone in the chain of command’s knowledge or permission." The Archdiocese for the Military Services released a statement April 4 saying it was "astounded that Catholics were listed alongside groups that are, by their very mission and nature, violent and extremist." The Archdiocese also said the training "appears to be an isolated incident not condoned by the Department of the Army." It called on the Defense Department to "ensure that taxpayer funds are never again used to present blatantly anti-religious material to the men and women in uniform." Our ruling Forbes, at a military budget hearing, said "We’ve had a training program ... where we list evangelical Christians, Catholics and Mormons in the same category of religious extremism as we do al-Qaida." This did happen in at least one briefing at a reserve center in Pennsylvania. The Army says it was a mistake -- made by an individual, not the command -- that was corrected upon the first complaint. Forbes, while offering no contrary information, made sweeping statements that suggest the training program was widespread and officially sanctioned. He also misread one entry on the list as Mormons, when, in fact, it named a small sect that practices polygamy. Forbes’ statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That makes it Mostly False.

pomt-05933	"Martin Luther King was a Republican."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/29/travis-rowley/republican-travis-rowley-says-martin-luther-king-j/	When you're famous and admired, everyone wants to claim you as their own. Take the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In a column that appeared on GoLocalProv.com the week of the slain civil rights leader's birthday, Travis Rowley, chairman of the Rhode Island Young Republicans, complained that liberals and Democrats consistently try to paint conservatives, Republicans and, in fact, all of America, as racist. Rowley said the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Dick Harpootlian, criticized Republicans for holding a presidential debate in the state on King's birthday, even though Democrats and the Congressional Black Caucus held a debate among the Democratic presidential candidates on King's birthday in 2008. "It seems like a fitting moment to remind everyone that Martin Luther King was a Republican and, if alive, would probably have come to his own party's defense by telling Harpootlian to stop being such a whiny, hyper-sensitive, little weasel," wrote Rowley. In recent history, blacks have overwhelmingly voted Democratic. So was King, who was assassinated in 1968 at the age of 39, really a Republican? Some historical context might be illuminating. The parties of King's era are not necessarily the parties we have today. King's father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., was a longtime Republican, not surprising at a time when most Southern Democrats supported segregation. And when the landmark Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, it was approved on the basis of geography, not party. It became law only after Republicans and Democrats outside the South joined forces to overturn a filibuster by Southern senators. Of the 22 Southern senators, 21 voted against it. All but one of the opponents were Democrats. Outside the South, only 1 of the 46 Democrats and 5 of the 32 Republicans in the U.S. Senate opposed it. But here we're focusing on the very narrow question of whether it's accurate to call the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. a Republican. Rowley's claim has been made before by other Republicans. When our PolitiFact colleagues in Tennessee and Texas checked the claim, both ruled it to be False. We'll repeat some of their points. Perhaps the best argument in Rowley's favor comes from King's niece, Alveda C. King, who said in 2008 that "during his lifetime, [King] was a Republican." But in 2008, King's son, Martin Luther King III, said it was "disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican. It is even more outrageous to suggest he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African American votes in Florida and many other states." PolitiFact found that King scholars agree with King's son. "I've not seen any evidence that MLK Jr. was a Republican but if he registered to vote it would have been as a Republican in Alabama simply because the Dems. would not allow black voters. Throughout the [Civil Rights] movement he worked with the northern Dem. Party," said Dr. Kenneth W. Goings, professor and past chairman of the Department of African American and African Studies at Ohio State University, in an e-mail to PolitiFact Tennessee. Thomas Jackson, a history professor at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, told PolitiFact that blacks began turning toward the Democratic party during the New Deal. He called King a " 'tax and spend' democratic socialist." "He wanted the nation to spend billions of dollars directly to employ the unemployed when the private sector failed, and a vigorous mixture of affirmative action and anti-poverty programs championed by the liberal-left, and targeted federal spending in impoverished areas, especially the nation's slums," said Jackson. (His proposal to spend $50 billion over 10 years -- $357 billion at today's prices -- to help the disadvantaged of all races was outlined in a 1965 Playboy interview.) And King reported in his autobiography that he wrote to one supporter in 1956 saying, "In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket." King's refusal to endorse one particular party also suggests that he had more important matters to deal with than partisan politics -- he wanted an end to racial discrimination, no matter which party delivered it. In an e-mail response, Rowley highlighted the comments of Alveda King and King's father's Republican roots. And he cited other sources who suggested why King should have been a Republican. But they didn’t prove that he was. When we asked Rowley whether he thought King's plan to spend billions to help minorities would be embraced by today's Republican party or attacked as socialism, he said it would depend on how the money would be spent. "There are 'spending' methods that don't result in socialist practices," he said, citing two examples: urban law enforcement to provide "the safety needed for a prosperous community" and school vouchers to "give parents the option to rescue their children from failing public school systems that have been destroyed by the Democrat-Teachers Union alliance." "The argument over which party MLK would affiliate with today is another story. And admittedly debatable," he added in a subsequent e-mail. Our ruling We can certainly envision King being willing to vote against the Southern Democrats who furiously promoted segregation and voting for Northern Republicans who worked to make equal rights a reality. But neither automatically make King a Republican, especially when, as a civil rights leader, he apparently wouldn't let himself be pigeon-holed into either political party. In short, Rowley and other advocates for the King-was-really-a-Republican theory haven't proven their case. So we will follow the lead of the two previous PolitiFact analyses and rule that Rowley's claim is False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-15051	The racial and ethnic makeup of the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office mirrors the community it serves.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/29/butch-conway/conways-claim-diverse-department-true/	Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway recently said publicly that the racial and ethnic makeup of his department mirrors the large and diverse north metro county it serves. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. But first a little context. The shooting of black teen Michael Brown by white police officer Darren Wilson in August 2014 prompted protests that roiled the Ferguson-St. Louis area for weeks. Anti-police rhetoric has been on the rise since Brown’s death and other highly publicized police-involved shootings. Conway, who has been Gwinnett’s sheriff for 19 years, weighed in on what some have labeled a "war on police" earlier this month, penning an op-ed piece for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that denounced senseless violence against police officers. It also described those making allegations of police racism as ‘hate groups’ and "domestic terrorists with an agenda." At a press conference on Sept. 16, Conway responded to critics of the piece and said he planned to meet with some who disagreed with his viewpoint or accused him of "burying his head in the sand" to racism in policing today. It was at that time that Conway also said that the racial and ethnic makeup of his department mirrors Gwinnett, the state’s second largest county. So what do the numbers show? We contacted Shannon Volkodav, a spokeswoman for the Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office, to request supporting data on all department staff, as well as its leadership. She provided a racial/ethnic breakdown of the department’s current staff, which we compared with estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau on the population of Gwinnett County in 2014, the latest year for which information is available. The Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office, with a 706-member staff, is 55.81 percent white, 35.55 percent African-American, 5.95 percent Hispanic, 2.27 percent Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.42 percent Native American/Alaskan. And the department serves an estimated 877,922 Gwinnett County residents, 58.1 percent of whom are white, 27 percent of whom are African-American, 20.5 percent of whom are Hispanic, 11.6 percent of whom are Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.8 percent of whom are Native American/Alaskan, according to the data we reviewed. Conway said in a telephone interview that a diverse department has been something he’s worked to achieve since first being elected sheriff in 1996. He said the administration is not as racially and ethnically diverse as he would like. But he said that’s a byproduct of the department and county having been predominately white well into the 1990s and senior administrators, most of whom have 20 to 25 years of experience, having risen through the ranks. (Whites make up 74 percent of front-line supervisors -- lieutenants, sergeants and corporals, according to department data.) Ronald Weitzer, a professor of sociology at George Washington University who specializes in police and minority relations, said the situation is not unusual. "It takes time for minority officers to move up through the hierarchy," Weitzer said. "It is also important that -- from the perspective of citizens who have contact with officers -- what matters is how diverse the department is on the ground." "Average residents may never encounter the top leadership or know what their demographics are," he said. The exception would be the chief of police, whose racial background would be known to the public, Weitzer said. We wondered how the Sheriff’s Office compared with Gwinnett County government as a whole. Joe Sorenson, the communications director for the county, provided data showing that 73.96 percent of the county’s workforce is white, 18.69 percent is black; 4.6 percent is Hispanic and 2.43 percent is Asian or Pacific Islander. The county is working to increase its diversity, but it’s not a quick process, Sorenson said. Some of its efforts include recruiting police officers at historically black colleges and universities, including Florida A&M University, Bethune-Cookman and Albany State, Sorenson said. Our ruling. Conway said his department mirrors the community it serves in racial and ethnic diversity. Data we reviewed show the department is more diverse than Gwinnett County government as a whole. African-Americans and other major ethnic and racial groups are represented in the department -- some groups are more proportionally represented in the department than others. But Conway’s overarching point stands up. We rate his statement as True.	None	Butch Conway	None	None	None	2015-09-29T00:00:00	2015-09-16	['None']
pomt-01334	Jason Carter never passed a bill in his tenure in the state Senate.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/24/nathan-deal/deal-correct-carter-hasnt-passed-bill/	Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has accused Democratic challenger Jason Carter of lacking the political chops for the job. During two recent debates, Deal asked Carter why he never assumed even minor leadership roles as a state senator or sponsored a successful bill in his tenure under the Gold Dome. "You’ve been in the (state) Senate since I’ve been governor, and you’ve never passed a bill," Deal said in the Oct. 7 debate at the Georgia National Fair. "Why would anybody decide you have the leadership skills needed to lead this state?" PolitiFact decided to delve deeper into Deal’s claim that Carter never passed a bill. Carter, an attorney and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, was elected in May 2010 to replace state Sen. David Adelman of Atlanta, who resigned to become the U.S. ambassador to Singapore. A few months later, Deal, a longtime congressman, was elected to succeed Sonny Perdue, Georgia’s first Republican governor since Reconstruction. Now, Carter, 39, is hoping to unseat Deal, 72, in the Nov. 4 general election. A loss for Deal would be a major upset for Republicans who have been solidly in control at the Capitol for about a decade. But what about the governor’s claim? A search of the Georgia General Assembly’s records shows Deal is correct. In four years in the state Senate, Carter was primary sponsor of 11 bills, more than half dealing with the popular HOPE scholarship or other education issues. None of the bills became law and only one cleared the state Senate. But is it a sign that he was an ineffective lawmaker? There’s no proof of that. Democrats are in the minority in the General Assembly and so are rarely able to pass legislation. (The same was true for Republicans until, starting with Perdue, the state took a 180-degree turn politically.) Steve Anthony, a lecturer in the political science department at Georgia State University, said it’s "common" that the party with an absolute majority banishes the minority to near irrelevance. He should know. He was the longtime chief of staff to Tom Murphy, a Democrat who at the time was the nation’s longest-serving state House speaker. "Many Republicans would say they are doing just what Tom Murphy used to do to them," Anthony said. "It’s a game. It’s what’s done in politics, at least on the state level." There’s one more point to consider: getting a bill passed and signed is not all that easy, regardless of party. In the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions, members of the House and Senate introduced 2,514 bills. Of those, only 774 passed, and 757 became law. Most of the successful bills emerge from the leadership, Anthony said. That leaves the bulk of rank-and-file lawmakers, including Carter, to end up as co-sponsors to legislation. Co-sponsoring is the act of a lawmaker attaching his or her name to a pending proposal to show support or backing. And in that capacity, Carter found some success. The Atlanta Democrat co-sponsored 21 bills that became law, records show. In some cases, members of the minority party co-sponsor bills that are their idea but require a member from the party in charge to be the official sponsor to get the measure passed. Whether a lawmaker has been a bill’s co-sponsor can be a serious question for voters. But, to Deal’s point, snagging co-sponsors often has little to no impact on whether a bill gets passed. Case in point: State Rep. Mark Hatfield got 93 of the 180 members in the House to co-sponsor his 2011 proposal that would force presidential and vice presidential candidates to prove their citizenship before landing on the Georgia ballot. The bill, inspired by the "birther" movement, which believes President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, ultimately lost more than 25 of those backers and failed to move to a floor vote. There have recently been high-profile exceptions to the significance of co-sponsors, such as Deal’s effort to revamp the HOPE scholarship program with House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat. Few Democrats are able to earn that sort of recognition. More common, Anthony said, would be a tactic long used when a good idea surfaces. If the proposal is from the opposition, the majority hijacks the idea and makes some changes to qualify it as a new bill – and takes the credit. Carter, a staunch critic of changes Deal made to the HOPE scholarship program, says that happened to him in 2013. He was concerned that tech school students were being hurt by a decision to raise the GPA requirement for HOPE recipients from a 2.0 to a 3.0. He and a House Democrat introduced separate bills to return to the lower GPA requirement. Their bills went nowhere. But their idea caught on and emerged in an almost identical and successful bill with a Republican as chief sponsor. "It's definitely harder to pass a bill in the minority. It takes time and it takes working with the opposition -- something that younger legislators probably haven't accomplished yet," said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. Deal, he said, is trying to say something about Carter’s relative youth and inexperience."You just got here, and already you want to be governor?" Our conclusion: Deal is right. Jason Carter hasn’t been the chief author of a bill that’s made it through the General Assembly. But that’s a fate most out-of-power Democrats face, as did Republicans in the decades they were in the same boat. That’s context the reader needs. We rate the statement as Mostly True.

pomt-15254	Under President Barack Obama, income levels and unemployment numbers "are worse now than just about ever" for African-Americans.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-black-income-unemployment-worse-now-j/	Just days before the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 campaign, billionaire real-estate developer and current polling leader Donald Trump criticized President Barack Obama’s record on ABC’s This Week. At one point, Trump zeroed in on Obama’s status as the country’s first black president, arguing that he had failed his black constituents. The topic came up when ABC’s Jonathan Karl referred to a tweet by Trump that said, "Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!" Karl asked Trump why he thought the country wouldn’t see another black president for "generations." Trump replied: "I think that he has set a very low bar, and I think it's a shame for the African-American people. And by the way, he has done nothing for African-Americans. You look at what's gone on with their income levels. You look at what's gone on with their youth. I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. I thought he'd do a fabulous job for the African-American citizens of this country. He has done nothing. They are worse now than just about ever. ... They have problems now in terms of unemployment numbers. Look at their unemployment numbers. … Here you have a black president who's done very poorly for the African-Americans of this country." We wondered whether Trump was right that under Obama, income levels and unemployment numbers "are worse now than just about ever" for African Americans. We looked at historical data trends for four specific measurements for African-Americans: Overall unemployment rates, youth unemployment rates (since Trump mentioned "youth"), poverty rates, and median income. We’ll take these one by one. Overall unemployment rates for African Americans The African-American unemployment rate when Obama entered office was 12.7 percent. By June 2015, it had fallen to 9.5 percent, a drop of about one-quarter. And compared to its Obama-era peak of 16.8 percent in March 2010, the unemployment rate has fallen by about 43 percent. But what about a longer historical look? The black unemployment rate was higher than its current rate between May 1974 and June 1997, and between November 2001 and June 2005. In all, since May 1974, black unemployment was higher than today’s rate in 328 months, and lower than today’s rate in 87 months. So it’s been higher than today 79 percent of the time since May 1974. So Trump's point here is wrong. Youth unemployment rates for African Americans For this category, we looked at the historical unemployment rate data for African-Americans age 16 to 24. Because this data is not seasonally adjusted (which makes a month-to-month comparison imprecise), we looked at the most recent month of June 2015 and all previous June data going back to the oldest, which is from 1972. In June 2015, the unemployment rate for black youth was 23.4 percent. That was down from 31 percent in June 2009. That’s a drop of about one-quarter. More important, in the previous 43 Junes, the rate has been lower than that in only seven of those months, and higher than that in 36 of those months. So it’s been higher than its current rate 84 percent of the time, meaning Trump isn’t correct by this statistic, either. African-American poverty rate The black poverty rate is one of Obama’s weaker statistics. The poverty rate rose from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 27.2 percent in 2013, the most recent year available. That’s about 5 percent higher than it was when Obama took office. It’s also higher than at any time prior to the Obama presidency going back to 1996. Still, even today’s higher black poverty rate is hardly unprecedented: It was higher than it is now between 1959 and 1996 -- a 38-year period. So Trump isn’t correct by this measurement, either. African-American median income We looked at household median income for African-Americans and found a similar pattern to the poverty rate: Inflation-adjusted incomes have worsened during Obama’s tenure, but they are hardly the worst rates in history. In 2013, the median income for black households was $34,598. That’s lower than 2009 in inflation-adjusted dollars, though it’s up slightly compared to 2010. This could certainly be considered stagnation, if not shrinkage. Median income in 2013 was also lower than it was between 1996 and 2009 -- not a stellar accomplishment. On the other hand, inflation-adjusted median household income was below today’s level between 1967 and 1995. So it was worse than today two-thirds of the time between 1967 and the year Obama became president. So Trump’s wrong using this measurement as well. Our ruling Trump said that under Obama, income levels and unemployment numbers "are worse now than just about ever" for African-Americans. Some key statistics for African-Americans, such as unemployment, improved significantly during Obama’s tenure. The ones that stagnated or worsened under Obama are still relatively positive compared to recent history. Trump is wrong by several important measures. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12681	"2009-2010, let's remember, hundreds of Republican amendments were adopted in the ACA."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/16/luis-gutierrez/rep-gutierrez-says-hundreds-republican-amendments-/	Republicans continue to sell their health care plan in an effort to deliver on a party-wide campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Yet during a roundtable discussion on State of the Union, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., pushed back on charges of Democratic obstructionism regarding health care legislation. Anchor Jake Tapper asked if Gutierrez was involved, or if Democrats were "just sitting by the sidelines opposing everything." "Very different process," Gutierrez replied. "2009-2010, let's remember, hundreds of Republican amendments were adopted in the ACA." We decided to look into Gutierrez’s claim that the final version of the Affordable Care Act incorporated hundreds of Republican amendments. When the ACA was making its way through Congress, former President Barack Obama made a similar statement in September 2009. During a joint address to Congress, he said that his plan incorporated the ideas of both Republicans and Democrats. We rated that claim Mostly False, because many of the amendments Republicans introduced were technical in nature. Republicans had several opportunities to introduce amendments to the Affordable Care Act, in both the Senate and House bills. Ultimately, for procedural reasons tied to the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., the Senate version was the only one that moved forward. But Republicans offered changes in the committees that considered the bills before the whole chambers voted on them. For example, 788 amendments were submitted during the ACA’s markup in the Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee (HELP). Three quarters of them were filed by the committee’s Republican members, according to John McDonough in his book Inside National Health Reform. Of those, 161 were adopted in whole or revised form. Yet as we reported at the time, those amendments were mostly technical. Only two of those Republican amendments were passed via roll-call vote. One of these amendments required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option and the other involved biologics medication. The Senate Finance Committee took up another version of the bill. Senators initially offered 564 amendments. During that markup, about six Republican amendments were adopted via roll call vote, and others were adopted by unanimous consent, without objection, and via voice vote, according to coverage by Congressional Quarterly. Parts of this bill merged with the bill the HELP committee marked up to become the final law. Gutierrez’s office pointed us toward a fact sheet from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s, D-Calif., office that said 147 Republican amendments were incorporated in the final Senate bill, though the sheet did not expand on the nature of those amendments. On the House side, some Republican amendments to the Affordable Care Act were accepted in committee; 24 Republican amendments were incorporated in the Energy and Commerce Committee, and six were incorporated in the Education and Workforce committee. Republicans sponsored 38 amendments in the Ways and Means committee, and each one was rejected. Timothy Jost, emeritus professor of law at Washington and Lee University School of Law, told us that "the basic statement that hundreds were adopted is wrong." But Jost added that "there was very significant Republican participation early on on the Senate side. There were dozens of hours of debate, and Republicans like Sen. Chuck Grassley on the Senate Finance Committee were very engaged." Jost said by September 2009 that period was over and from then on, the bill was strictly a Democratic piece of legislation. It’s worth noting that many facets of the Republican’s health care agenda at the time made it into the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act was a private market plan, and it dropped a long-held Democratic priority to include a public option. In the end, no Senate or House Republicans voted for the Affordable Care Act in its final version. Our ruling Gutierrez said that "hundreds of Republican amendments were adopted" during the drafting of the 2010 health care law. His statement has some basis, because Republican amendments were adopted in both the House and the Senate during the legislative process. Most of these amendments were not particularly meaningful, though, so calling it a bipartisan enactment effort remains a stretch. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11074	On separating families at the border.	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/20/leah-vukmir/has-trump-backer-and-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-/	Amid a growing uproar, has Republican U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir -- a consistently hardline supporter of President Donald Trump -- changed her position on separating children from their parents at the border? Read our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race We turn to the Flip-O-Meter, which examines an official's consistency on an issue. It does not pass a judgment on a politician who changes positions, or determine if any shift is good policy or good politics. Vukmir is running against Kevin Nicholson in the August 2018 GOP primary. The winner takes on first-term Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin in the November 2018 general election. News reports indicated a change on Vukmir’s part. So, let’s take a closer look. What’s been happening As PolitiFact National has reported: U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April 2018 announced a "zero-tolerance" policy, meaning every person caught crossing the border illegally would be referred for federal prosecution. A good number of these people are adult migrants traveling with children. By law, when adults are detained and criminally prosecuted, their children cannot be housed with them in jail. Instead, kids are placed in a Department of Health and Human Services shelter until they can be released to a legal guardian. Some 2,000 children have been separated from the adults they were traveling with across the U.S. border, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The children were separated from 1,940 adults from April 19 through May 31, 2018, as a result of border-crossing prosecutions. Now to what Vukmir has said. ‘Process has to be upheld’ Vukmir had this exchange with Milwaukee-based TV show host Mike Gousha during a June 8, 2018 interview (broadcast June 10, 2018): Gousha: "Do you have any concerns about some of the reports coming from along the border that say that people who are either seeking asylum or are trying to cross into the country illegally -- that parents and children are being separated? Do you have concerns about that?" Vukmir: "Obviously, and I am going to have to watch that very closely. But people are taking advantage of our generosity in this country and I believe we are a nation of laws, and we have to stand up and uphold those laws ….There is a process that has to be upheld." Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc So, Vukmir states concern about separating children from their parents at the border. But she does not express opposition to the practice and says laws must be upheld. Vukmir had a different take 11 days later. ‘Shouldn’t be separated’ Vukmir made this statement to the Associated Press on June 19, 2018: "Of course families shouldn’t be separated. I was discussing this with" U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., "and he told me they’d be having a hearing as soon as next week to move on a fix to address this problem right away." This is a shift. Vukmir is saying the practice of separating children from their parents should not happen. The next day, Trump himself changed positions. As USA Today reported: "President Trump, facing a national outcry, said Wednesday he would sign an executive order to keep migrant families together at the border, abandoning his earlier claim that the crisis was caused by an iron-clad law and not a policy that he could reverse." On that, Vukmir’s campaign told us Vukmir is "glad" about Trump’s decision and "now we need to focus on fixing our broken immigration system, and that begins with securing our borders." Our rating Our ratings on the Flip-O-Meter are: No Flip – No significant change in position. Half Flip – A partial change in position. Full Flop – A complete change in position. Vukmir never explicitly declared support for separating children from their parents at the border. But she went from stating no opposition to the practice, and saying laws must be upheld, to saying it shouldn’t happen. For a partial change in position, we give Vukmir a Half Flip.

pomt-00880	"The Iranian parliament will get to say yes or no on this deal, and I think the United States Congress should have the exact same input into the process."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/10/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-irans-parliament-gets-vote-nuclear-dea/	Republican Sen. Ron Johnson wants President Barack Obama to seek Congress’ approval before finalizing a deal with Iran, an agreement that would halt the country’s nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanction relief. Obama has argued that since the agreement is not a treaty, Congress’ approval isn’t needed. But Johnson, R-Wis., one of 47 GOP senators who signed a controversial letter to Iran critical of the negotiations, isn’t buying it. "The Iranian parliament will get to say yes or no on this deal," Johnson said March 8, "and I think the United States Congress should have the exact same input into the process." It’s a curious comparison, but is it accurate? We decided to check. You can look at this through two lenses: What does Iran’s Constitution literally say about the duties of the parliament, called the Islamic Consultative Assembly or the Majles? And in practice, what responsibilities does the parliament actually have in an authoritarian regime heavily controlled by the Supreme Leader and the unelected 12-member Guardian Council? The Iran Constitution The Iranian parliament is made up of 290 elected officials. Their duties are outlined in the country’s Constitution. There are some strict limitations on the body’s power. For example, it "cannot enact laws contrary to the usual and ahkam (the Islamic commandments) of the official religion of the country or to the Constitution." The Guardian Council determines if a law is in violation and it often overturns legislation in the name of Islam or the constitution. But the Constitution does bestow some broad powers on the assembly. Article 77 says, "International treaties, protocols, contracts, and agreements must be approved by the Islamic Consultative Assembly." That would seem to be a point for Johnson, right? Not necessarily. Just as the White House contends that the agreement is not a treaty and therefore not subject to congressional approval, Obama’s National Security Council says the deal would not fall under "international treaties, protocols, contracts and agreements" in the Iranian Constitution. Experts agreed. "The Iranian parliament has the authority to ratify treaties, but a possible nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 will be a political agreement, not a treaty," said Alireza Nader, a senior policy analyst at RAND Corporation. "The Majles can debate the agreement, but it is unlikely to vote yes or no on it. The political establishment, including the Supreme Leader, president, etc., will have the critical voice." There is one aspect of the agreement that may need approval from Iran’s parliament. The Joint Plan of Action for reaching an agreement says that the final step to a comprehensive solution is contingent on Iran ratifying and implementing the "additional protocol." What’s that? Under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which Iran signed, member countries must abide to standards set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 2003, the agency approved additional protocols for Iran so the agency could monitor Iran’s nuclear sites. While Iran temporarily abided by the additional protocol, it has since stopped, and it never ratified the agreement. If Iran wants the United States to lift its economic sanctions, it must ratify that agreement, which would require action by Iran’s parliament. A 'dead letter'? Johnson’s staff pointed us to a report on Iran’s parliament from the United States Institute of Peace. It noted that the Islamic Consultative Assembly has "forced a degree of accountability on the executive branch through its powers over the budget, confirmation or impeachment of ministers, and interpellation," and that "has long served as the one public outlet for political differences." "By Middle East standards, the persistence and vitality of Iran’s Majles has been somewhat remarkable," the report said, especially as a vehicle for local cultural and economic debate. But the same report also noted how toothless the body is, particularly on foreign policy. Every candidate that runs for parliament is vetted by the Guardian Council. As it is, turnover is constant, and dissenters don’t last long. And unelected leaders often get around the body’s legislative role or strong arm the assembly, particularly on nuclear issues, the report said. Put bluntly, any power the Constitution grants the parliament is a "dead letter," said Matthew Kroenig, co-author of The Handbook of National Legislatures: A Global Survey. "It is inconceivable that the Iranian parliament would stand in the way of an agreement that had the support of the government and the Supreme Leader," said Kroenig, professor of international relations at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. Johnson’s office noted that already Iran’s parliament voted on the nuclear negotiations. That came on Jan. 6, when the Islamic Consultative Assembly held a vote on the government’s handling of the nuclear negotiations. But the assembly ultimately sided with the regime and the vote had no repercussions tied to it anyway. The parliament is under "heavy influence of the Supreme Leader, and in recent years has not acted against his interests," Nader said. Our ruling Johnson said, "The Iranian parliament will get to say yes or no" on the nuclear deal. This is incorrect on two accounts. Experts said the nuclear agreement between the United States and Iran won’t require ratification by Iran’s parliament, the Islamic Consultative Assembly. It’s possible the deal will be contingent on Iran’s ratification of a previous international nuclear agreement, which might require the assembly’s approval, but the body won’t weigh in on the deal currently being worked on. And even if it did, it would be entirely symbolic, as the assembly is heavily influenced by the Supreme Leader on foreign policy matters. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06645	"170,000 of the jobs" created in Texas under Gov. Rick Perry "were government jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/14/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-under-rick-perry-government-jobs-gre/	With the polls now showing Rick Perry ahead for the Republican nomination, his opponents are trying to undercut his claims of soaring job growth while he's been governor of Texas. During the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, sought to put some blemishes on Perry’s record by noting that many of the new jobs were in the government. CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, the debate moderator, began the exchange by asking Paul about Perry’s claims of economic success in the Lone Star State. "You’re from Texas," Blitzer said. "Does your governor deserve all that credit?" Paul answered, "Not quite. I’m a taxpayer there. My taxes have gone up. Our taxes have doubled since he’s been in office. Our spending has gone up double. Our debt has gone up nearly triple. So, no. And 170,000 of the jobs were government jobs. So I would put a little damper on this, but I don’t want to offend the governor, because he might raise my taxes or something." For this item, we’re looking exclusively at Paul’s claim that "170,000 of the jobs" created in Texas under Perry "were government jobs." We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal source of employment data for the nation, states and localities. We looked at government job growth during Perry’s tenure, from January 2001 to July 2011: State government jobs: Increase of 49,100, or about 4,600 per year of Perry’s tenure Local government jobs: Increase of 217,600, or about 20,700 per year Federal government jobs: Increase of 19,700, or about 1,900 per year Total government jobs: Increase of 286,400, or about 27,300 per year Meanwhile, Texas employment overall increased over this period by 1,078,600, or about 102,700 per year. Looking at it a different way, the number of local government jobs has increased by 21 percent during Perry’s tenure, while state government jobs have expanded at a 15 percent clip. Let's put all of this in perspective. The increase in state government jobs represented about 4 percent of Texas’ total jobs increase; for local government jobs, it was 20 percent; for federal jobs, it was less than 2 percent. We see a few different ways to analyze these numbers. First, in critiquing Perry, not all government jobs are created equal. Perry has the most direct influence over the growth in state jobs. His influence on local government jobs is weaker. And he has relatively little influence in securing federal job increases. (Indeed, given his theme that the feds are overreaching, he might very well want fewer federal employees.) How big is Perry’s sway over local government jobs? We checked with representatives of cities and counties, and they agreed that it is pretty limited. Cities get about 36 percent of their funds from property taxes, 29 percent from sales taxes and much of the rest from items such as fines, right-of-way rentals and user fees, said Bennett Sandlin, executive director of the Texas Municipal League, which represents 1,100 Texas cities. Those sorts of income streams are not affected by the governor to any significant degree. Counties, similarly, are "highly reliant on the property tax," said Elna Christopher, a spokeswoman for the Texas Association of Counties. She said that state mandates can affect county employment numbers, particularly because a jail standards commission sets required ratios between prison inmates and correctional-officers. But while the governor appoints the commissioners, he doesn’t directly influence their deliberations. This leaves one major area: the public schools. The state government does have significant influence over education budgets -- and most recently, this impact has been to shrink rather than increase. Earlier this year, Perry and the legislature decided to fund school districts by $4 billion less in 2012-13 than existing formulas would have provided. And during Perry’s tenure, local education jobs -- which Perry would have the most influence over -- have increased at a slower rate than local government jobs as a whole. Local education jobs have risen at about 11 percent, while non-educational local government jobs have risen by 37 percent. So with the government jobs Perry can affect the most -- state jobs -- the raw-number increase was well below what Paul claimed. Only if you use a more expansive definition of government jobs -- including jobs Perry doesn’t have much of an impact on -- is the increase bigger than what Paul claimed. Having said that, the increase in total government jobs under Perry is not trivial. State government jobs represented 4 percent of the overall increase for all types of jobs, but the combination of all government jobs accounted for nearly 27 percent. And if you look at government jobs as a percentage of all jobs in Texas, the share has risen from 16.4 percent at the start of Perry’s tenure to 17.5 percent today. And here’s one more factor to consider: As state and local government jobs were increasing, so was the state's population -- more rapidly than anywhere in the nation. Between mid 2001 and mid 2010, Texas’ population increased by a whopping 20 percent. The growth in local government jobs -- 21 percent -- roughly kept pace with that growth, while state government jobs increased at a somewhat slower pace, 15 percent. Both growth rates were faster than the national average. Nationally, local and state government jobs both grew by slightly under 6 percent during the same period. Our ruling We can’t find an exact match for Paul’s 170,000 figure in the official statistics, and getting to that number requires not just state jobs, but also local government jobs that Perry would have had difficulty influencing. Still, there's some truth in Paul’s underlying claim that a notable share of the job growth Perry touts on the campaign trail came from government jobs. Even leaving out federal jobs, about one out of every four new jobs in Texas during Perry’s tenure has been a new state or local government job. So while Paul is wrong on the specific numbers, he makes a larger point with some merit. We’ll call it Half True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-09-14T15:53:46	2011-09-12	['Texas', 'Rick_Perry']
pomt-09516	During "the recent global warming summit in Copenhagen, Nancy Pelosi and others stayed at a five-star hotel on a trip costing nearly $10,000 per person."	true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/17/david-dewhurst/lt-gov-david-dewhurst-says-pelosi-and-others-cost-/	In an e-mail blast, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican, told supporters that spending in Washington is out of control. Dewhurst spiced his Tuesday e-mail with a reference to the Democratic House speaker, stating that "during the recent global warming summit in Copenhagen, Nancy Pelosi and others stayed at a five-star hotel on a trip costing nearly $10,000 per person." The House speaker living large in Denmark? We checked into that. Dewhurst’s campaign pointed us to a USA Today post online reflecting on a report by CBS News, which reviewed travel vouchers filed by Pelosi’s office after the international climate summit in December. A summary of the travel vouchers filed by Pelosi’s office states that air fare, food and lodging costs for 57 people including Pelosi added up to $553,564. That works out to $9,711 per person. CBS found that a factor in the travel costs was that the host hotel, a five-star Marriott, required guests to pay for six nights’ stay even if they were staying two nights, as Pelosi did. CBS also said that in fairness, "many attendees told us they did a lot of hard work, and laid the groundwork for a future global treaty." Pelosi's food and lodging expenses totaled $4,406 (she, like many, took a military jet to the summit). She declined to discuss the trip costs, CBS said. Pelosi personally accounted for less than 10 percent of the costs reported by her office for dozens of individuals. Still, Dewhurst correctly summarized the overall per-person travel costs.

pomt-00830	Says Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed reduction in university spending is "about the size of the one" under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, but Democrats didn’t treat Doyle’s cut as so dire.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/25/robin-vos/robin-vos-says-walker-cut-uw-budget-similar-doyles/	When Gov. Scott Walker proposed a $300 million cut to the state’s university system over two years, Democrats called it a "massive" and "destructive" blow. That stuck in the craw Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, even though he thought Walker’s plan cut too much. "Let’s remember that the cut that’s happening under Gov. Walker is about the size of the one that happened under (Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle)," Vos said March 12, 2015 in an interview on Wisconsin Eye. Vos added: "I didn’t hear Democrats then complaining about the loss of the university and how the world was going to come to an end." Vos was responding to a prediction from Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, that the university system would fall from the top ranks nationally for a generation under Walker’s plan. (We rated Mostly True a Barca claim from the interview that "the average faculty member at UW-Madison brings in close to a quarter million dollars a year" in grant money). The largest cut to higher education during Doyle’s eight-year tenure came in his 2003-’05 budget, his first. That’s the budget Vos was referring to said aide Kit Beyer. First, the numbers. Walker’s cut in state support, depending on how you tally it up, amounts to between $278 million and $297 million in the 2015-’17 budget. The Doyle cut, approved by Republican lawmakers, was $250 million from 2003 to 2005. The best comparison is the percentage view: Walker’s cut amounts to between 12 percent and 13 percent of state general-fund aid to the university system; Doyle’s was 12 percent. So, as Vos said, the reductions were quite comparable. But Vos’ analysis skips past an important point. In 2003, Doyle and legislative Republicans allowed tuition to rise by 18 percent, or $150 million. That took a lot of the sting out of the budget cuts. In contrast, Walker has again proposed a tuition freeze, blocking the university from turning to students or their families to backfill the budget. Now to the second part of Vos’ claim, that Democrats didn’t see the 2003 cut in the apocalyptic way they describe Walker’s. We reviewed news releases posted on WisPolitics.com and looked at news stories from that time. Democrats did appear to lay off of Doyle’s UW cuts, at least publicly. One Milwaukee-area Democrat, state Rep. Sheldon Wasserman said: "We're in a fiscal crisis. The truth is, I think the whole situation is not fair. At this point, although the university is being hit, when you're dealing with life and death (matters), it's a basic triage." The same can’t be said of UW administrators and student groups, both of whom pushed back pretty hard on the cuts and the tuition increase. "We don't have too many friends in the Legislature, and I'd like to know why because we're not bad people doing bad things to the state," Linda Weimer, the UW System's vice president for university relations, was quoted as saying in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story. Vos focused on Democratic Party legislators in his claim, though, not on students or UW officials. And lawmakers and Doyle defended the cut, in part, by pointing out UW tuition rates were among the lowest in the Big 10 at the time. There’s one other piece of context worth noting when comparing Democratic reaction in 2003 and 2015. Doyle’s 2003 cut was the first significant reduction in state support in years. The previous budget, under Gov. Scott McCallum, cut $12 million; the one before that actually increased state support. The fact that UW had been spared deep cuts in the years leading up to 2003 seemed to mute reaction from both parties to the big Doyle cut. By contrast, under Walker, his proposed 2015-’17 reduction comes four years after cuts of $250 million to universities in his first budget (2011-’13). Our rating Vos said Walker’s proposed reduction in university spending is "about the size of the one that happened" under Doyle, but Democrats didn’t treat that cut as so dire. The one cut Vos referred to, in 2003 under Doyle and legislators, was very similar in size to Walker’s current proposal. It’s worth pointing out though that Doyle, unlike Walker, allowed big tuition hikes to ease the 2003 budget cuts, and that Walker has proposed deeper cuts in the UW System than Doyle in less time. We rate the Vos claim Mostly True.	None	Robin Vos	None	None	None	2015-03-25T13:58:11	2015-03-12	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Jim_Doyle']
pomt-13609	"In Washington, Congressman Joe Heck supports privatizing (Social Security), turning our savings over to Wall Street and risking it on the stock market."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/aug/15/afscme/union-backed-ad-repeats-inaccurate-claim-joe-heck-/	A well-worn Democratic attack line is being repeated in Nevada’s Senate race, with a major union dropping seven figures on a new television ad attacking Republican candidate Joe Heck. The political arm of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is running several ads warning viewers that Heck would be a "threat" to the future of the entitlement program. "In Washington, Congressman Joe Heck supports privatizing it, turning our savings over to Wall Street and risking it on the stock market." the ad says. "Heck's plan means billions more for Wall Street, and they've donated over half a million dollars to his campaign." The donations aspect of the ad is relatively straightforward, as the securities and investment industry has donated $525,569 to Heck throughout his congressional career, according to an OpenSecrets.com tally (roughly 73 percent of that sum coming during his current Senate run). But the main claim of the ad, that Heck would "privatize" Social Security and subsequently jeopardize the program’s fiscal stability, is one that PolitiFact and other Nevada journalists have called inaccurate on multiple occasions. Democrats have used the specter of Republican-led efforts to privatize Social Security as a political boogeyman since at least 2005, when then-President George W. Bush unsuccessfully proposed a plan to quasi-privatize the entitlement program for younger workers. Many Republicans (not just Heck and Bush) have supported adding optional private accounts for younger workers as a way to extend the life of the entitlement program, which is scheduled to run out of reserve funds in 2034 and be unable to pay out full benefits to future beneficiaries. Here’s what Heck has actually proposed or has mentioned as a potential change for the entitlement program: Indexing the retirement age from 67 to 69 by one month per year for the next 24 years; Allowing younger workers to voluntarily invest retirement funds directed toward Social Security into other private markets; Possibly raising the cap on earnings to which the Social Security tax applies ($118,500 in 2015). It’s that second point that AFSCME says backs up the claim that Heck wants to "privatize" Social Security. (Heck calls it a "diversified investment.") This is somewhat of an argument over semantics: Is Heck’s proposal privatization or not? PolitiFact has generally found that support for voluntary private Social Security accounts for younger workers doesn’t merit the sort of concerns or consequences implied by a "full privatization" of the program. The vast majority of Republicans, including Heck, say they’re adamantly opposed to making any changes that would affect those already receiving benefits or about to enter the program. It’s misleading of the ad to suggest that Nevada senior citizens could lose "our savings" given that Heck has never called for changes to be made for current beneficiaries. AFSCME did point to several reports on the potential fiscal cost of a quasi-privatized option, most of which were published nearly a decade ago when the Bush administration was pushing for changes to the entitlement program. Heck was elected to Congress in 2010. As the ad points out, Bush’s plan to shift to a partially privatized version of Social Security would likely lead to billions of dollars in fees for the brokerages and mutual fund businesses who would oversee the new individual accounts. Heck has previously said he’s more concerned about securing retirement for individuals than ensuring the future solvency of the program. "It’s not about making Social Security solvent," Heck said to the Las Vegas Sun in 2010. "It’s about securing people’s retirement." In 2011, Heck did join House Republicans in a vote against an amendment that would have prohibited the use of appropriated funds to cut or "privatize" Social Security and other entitlements. Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baluta said in an email that private investments could potentially entail anything from U.S. Treasury securities, annuities, CDs, money market funds, interest-bearing savings accounts or employer-matched retirement savings account. "But all this is moot, because it’s a theoretical discussion about how to address the long-range insolvency of (Social Security)," Baluta said in an email. "There is no Joe Heck plan to privatize Social Security." This isn’t the first time AFSCME has gone after Heck on this particular issue — the union was sharply criticized over a similar ad in 2010 by journalists including Jon Ralston, who accused the union of "blatant fear mongering." Our ruling A new AFSCME ad claims that Heck "supports privatizing (Social Security), turning our savings over to Wall Street, and risking it on the stock market." Heck has stated an openness to supporting optional, private retirement accounts for people under a certain age as an alternative to the existing Social Security program, but AFSCME is bending the truth. Despite what the ad implies, Heck has never suggested a mandatory privatization of the entitlement system that would forcibly "turn our savings over to Wall Street." Because this ad is partially accurate but takes things way out of context, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e5621fe-e15c-4d76-97bf-10e670c5c320	None	AFSCME	None	None	None	2016-08-15T12:02:25	2016-08-10	['Washington,_D.C.', 'Joe_Heck', 'New_York_Stock_Exchange']
pomt-06094	Says the National Labor Relations Board told Boeing that it couldn’t build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-ad-says-labor-board-tried-block-boeing/	With the South Carolina presidential primary fast approaching, Mitt Romney’s campaign released an ad blasting President Barack Obama over a union dispute involving an airplane factory in North Charleston, S.C. In the ad, Romney stands in front of workers on a factory floor and says that "the National Labor Relations Board, now stacked with union stooges selected by the president, says to a free enterprise like Boeing, ‘you can’t build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state.’ "That is simply un-American. It’s political payback of the worst kind. It is wrong for America, and it is something that will stop under my administration." Romney made this same basic claim during an October 2011 debate. Its stems from a complaint filed by the NLRB against Boeing over its decision to build a jet factory in South Carolina, instead of ramping up production at its existing union facility in Washington state. PolitiFact looked into it then and found that Romney distorted the facts. The background The Romney campaign told us previously that the source of his October statement was an April New York Times story about the NLRB complaint, which sought "to force Boeing to bring an airplane production line back to its unionized facilities in Washington state instead of moving the work to a non-union plant in South Carolina." About six years ago, Boeing was making plans for production of its newest passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner. The company explored making all the planes at its factories in Washington state, but in 2009, it decided to start a second production line in South Carolina. The union plants in Puget Sound would make seven planes a month; the non-union facility in North Charleston, S.C., would produce three a month. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers complained. The NLRB’s general counsel, Lafe Solomon, tried to bring the parties together but failed. In April 2011, Solomon formally issued a complaint on the grounds that Boeing built its factory in South Carolina in order to punish the union. Top Boeing officials had been open about the connection between the machinists union and the new factory. According to the filing, one executive told a newspaper that "the overriding factor (in transferring the line) was not the business climate. And it was not the wages we’re paying today. It was that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years." Solomon considered this retaliation against the union for having conducted strikes in the past. As such, he argued Boeing violated the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits employers from interfering with the right of workers to organize and to strike. Problems with Romney’s portrayal Solomon’s complaint initiated a process that sent the case to an administrative law judge. The judge’s ruling would then go to the NLRB to be voted up or down or changed. In short, the law provides a process with checks and balances -- an important point Romney ignored. (As it turned out, the case ended without a hearing. The NLRB dropped its complaint in December 2011, at the urging of the machinists union after it reached a deal on wages with Boeing.) In addition, the complaint against Boeing is not based on the fact that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. We spoke to lawyers who think the complaint is well-founded and lawyers who think it’s misguided, but they agree on this point. Stanford law professor William Gould, a former chair of the NLRB, thinks the general counsel was wrong to move this complaint forward. By his reading of federal law, employers have the legal right to minimize exposure to strikes, and deciding to locate a plant in a place where unions are weak can be a strategy that passes legal muster. But Gould said Romney did "make an error of fact." "He’s wrong in suggesting that the general counsel’s reasoning applies … to union or non-union states," Gould said. Another labor lawyer, Jeffrey Hirsch at the University of North Carolina Law School, concurred. "This has nothing to do with geography," Hirsch said. "You could switch the states, and the case would be identical." Both lawyers also said that if Romney is suggesting that the NLRB has done anything unusual, he’s completely wrong. "The NLRB has held in countless cases that employers can’t move to another facility for prohibited reasons," Gould said. A prohibited reason would be to punish the union. Even the spokesman for the National Right to Work Committee, Patrick Semmens, said the issue isn’t that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. "The more fundamental point is that it was a non-union facility," said Semmens, who maintained that Romney’s claim has merit. Our ruling The Romney ad claimed that the NLRB told Boeing that it "can’t build a factory in South Carolina because South Carolina is a right-to-work state." The NLRB’s complaint started a legal process that could ultimately have resulted in a factory closure, but the NLRB as a whole didn’t tell Boeing anything. What’s more, the legal basis for the action centered on whether Boeing was punishing the union for staging strikes, not that Boeing had opened a factory in a right-to-work state. We rate the statement False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-05T15:59:00	2012-01-05	['South_Carolina', 'Boeing']
pomt-12422	Says there are thousands of registered voters over 110 years old in North Carolina, including one who is 219 years old.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/18/chain-email/no-thousands-dead-people-are-not-registered-vote-n/	A chain email has begun circulating in North Carolina that claims widespread irregularities in the state’s voter rolls. The email caught our attention with its subject line, "PROOF !! North Carolina has the world's oldest voters !" It says there are thousands of registered voters in North Carolina who are 110 or more years old, including one person who is a whopping 219 years old. Though tongue-in-cheek, the implication is clear – that many dead people are still actively registered, perhaps allowing others to commit voter fraud by casting ballots in their names. "Perhaps it is something in the (North) Carolina water," the email begins. "I doubt there is another state in the Union who could claim, as NC does, to have 5,376 voters 110 years old, or older. One current voter was born in 1798, making him a rather hefty 219 years old, thereby nearly doubling the age of the oldest person on earth." If all this is true, it would clearly indicate some concerning irregularities. The Gerontology Research Group, which tracks the oldest living people, has been able to verify only 43 people in the entire world age 110 or older as of May 3. The email concludes that this is "more evidence that when you think of questionable elections, (North) Carolina should be the FIRST state that comes to mind." So we wanted to get to the bottom of which is fraudulent – this email, or the state’s voter rolls. Following the president’s lead? The chain email began making the rounds, it appears, shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new committee on May 11 to look into voter fraud around the country. Trump has consistently spread false claims about voter fraud, both during his presidential campaign and after winning the election. He said "millions" of people voted illegally for Hillary Clinton and that he should’ve won the popular vote, which PolitiFact ruled Pants On Fire. In reality, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is incredibly rare. Trump has also made unfounded accusations of widespread voter fraud against several individual states – all of which have been rated Pants On Fire – including North Carolina, California, New Hampshire and Virginia. Those claims are either vague about the type of fraud or refer specifically to immigrants voting illegally. None have claimed what this new chain email alleges, that dead people are somehow voting. In years past, versions of this claim have been popular on conservative and right-wing websites, internet forums and blogs – including Breitbart and the North Carolina-based Civitas Institute. Why so many ancient voters? The chain email’s most eye-popping claim is about that 219-year-old voter. It’s also the first mistake the email makes. It refers to that person as a male, but a list of voters included in the email clearly shows he is really a she. There’s more intrigue: In 2012, when Breitbart wrote about super-old voters in North Carolina, it didn’t mention anyone over 200. We wondered if this woman only recently decided – nearly a century since being eligible to vote – that now was the time to finally register. So we asked Pat Gannon, the spokesman for the North Carolina State Board of Elections. He said the state database does appear to show 5,391 people over 110 – a few more than the email mentioned, even – but that there are several honest explanations. For the 219-year-old, he said, it amounts to just plain human error when a clerk was entering the person’s information. "The ‘219-year-old’ voter was inadvertently given a birth date of 1797 instead of 1979, according to our research," Gannon wrote in an email. "We’ve also determined that the voters that show up as 118, 120 and 154 years old do so because of data entry errors. Their dates of birth will soon be corrected in our database." But that only covers four out of 5,391. What about the rest? Nearly all of them – 97.5 percent – are what the state calls "legacy voters." Until the 1990s, people who registered to vote in North Carolina didn't have to list their date of birth. They only had to promise they were at least 18. Then, in the late 2000s, the state digitized its voter records. Gannon said anyone who was in the system with no date of birth was automatically listed as being born Jan. 1 in either 1900 or 1901. Of the 5,391 voters who appear over 110 in the database, he said, 5,257 fall into that category. As for the other 130 questionable voters (2.4 percent of the total), Gannon said, some could still be alive, could be dead, or could be listed due to clerical errors like the four they’ve already identified. Most North Carolina voters who die are automatically removed from voter rolls, since they die in North Carolina or another state that shares its records with North Carolina. But Gannon said some states don’t share their records, including South Carolina and Virginia, the two states with the longest borders with North Carolina. Any North Carolina voters who die in one of those states won’t have their registrations revoked until either a family member notifies the state or eight years go by without that person voting. And while it’s possible there are dead people on the voter rolls, people committing fraud by voting in their names is almost unheard of. In the 2016 general election, two people in North Carolina were caught voting for dead family members, out of 4.8 million voters statewide who cast a ballot, according to a previous audit by the elections board. Our ruling After President Donald Trump announced a new commission on voter fraud, a chain email has been making the rounds in North Carolina suggesting voter fraud and "questionable elections." It cites thousands of people registered to vote who couldn’t possibly be alive. However, nearly 98 percent of those people are actually voters who the state lists as being born in 1900 or 1901 since they didn’t have to give their date of birth when registering to vote. Others are on the list simply due to clerical errors. Of these nearly 5,400 voters who appear 110 or older, no more than 130 are dead. And it could be less. A 2016 audit found only two cases of people voting in the name of a dead person, out of more than 4.8 million votes cast. The email reaches a faulty conclusion based on a dishonest premise, and we rate its claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Correction: An earlier version of this article said inactive voters have their registrations automatically revoked after 16 years. It's actually after eight years. This did not affect our ruling.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2017-05-18T16:17:38	2017-05-11	['North_Carolina']
pomt-06692	"(U.S. Reps.) Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are … shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/06/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-republican-represe/	For members of Congress, the "town hall" meeting with constituents has taken on a new dynamic. The once-routine chats with the folks back home have, at times, become highly charged sessions with large crowds. They’ve become a barometer of sorts of public sentiment -- or the ability of opponents to organize. Democrats faced hostile crowds during the summer of 2009 when the hot topic was the federal health care reform bill. Some of the meetings drew hundreds and saw shouting, pushing and shoving. President Barack Obama decried what he called "scare tactics" from opponents. And one left leaning blog ran a list of dozens of town hall meetings believed to be targeted for disruption. Congressional Republicans got a similar reception in the spring and summer of 2011. The frequent topic: Proposals by House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to alter Medicare. Tempers flared and meetings were disrupted, including one in April in Racine where Ryan asked police to remove a protester. So as Congress settled into its August break, the Wisconsin Democratic Party took a shot at some of the state’s GOP members of Congress -- Ryan, and freshmen Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble. In an Aug. 17, 2011 email to supporters, state Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate said: "Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records that they are shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them." Buried amid the heated, and opinionated, rhetoric -- "so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records" -- there’s a powerful factual claim: Are the three "shutting down" town hall meetings or "making constituents pay" to see them? A Democratic Party spokesman did not respond to an email request for evidence backing up the statement. So we were left to search the public record and to make our own calls. The genesis of the claim appears to be a Politico article from the day before the party’s release that began this way: "The House Budget Committee chairman isn’t holding any face-to-face open-to-the-public town hall meetings during the recess, but like several of his colleagues he will speak only for residents willing to open their wallets." Now, what about the party’s claim? The claim starts off on a wrong track: Ribble participated in a forum in Appleton on Aug. 8, 2011, and Duffy held a town hall meeting in Wausau on Aug. 15, 2011. Ryan, meanwhile, held an Aug. 8, 2011 "telephone town hall meeting" with residents of Rock County. So, all three had meetings of some variety -- in person or the newfangled phone-in approach -- before the party’s claim was even made. Indeed, members of Congress don’t always have town hall meetings during a recess. And by at least one measure, Republicans were more likely to do so this time than Democrats. A nonpartisan group called No Labels released a survey Aug. 22, 2011 that found "67.9% of Democrats and 50.8% of Republicans stating they had no town hall meetings scheduled for the recess period." So what about the second thrust of the Democratic claim: Are the Republicans hiding behind a pay wall? We found three events where money was involved. The events were not fund-raisers for the congressmen, but lunch meetings open to the public that carried a cost. The most highly publicized -- and politicized -- one is an appearance by Ryan on Sept. 6, 2011 sponsored by the Whitnall Park Rotary Club. The club’s website says: "This is NOT a town hall meeting format, and the $15 fee covers only the lunch and other costs incurred in enabling an open public invitation." Club officer Gilbert Freen told us the group routinely charges guests to cover the cost of the lunch served at its meetings. The Democrats, some union groups and others view this as outrageous. Citizen Action of Wisconsin says it is organizing buses to bring people to protest Ryan’s appearance. But politicians of all stripes regularly appear at such luncheons. For instance, on Aug. 23, 2011, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis) spoke to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee. That event was not open to the public -- just to members and their guests, who paid $17.50 each. Numerous other politicians (including Ryan and Moore together in 2009) have appeared at Newsmaker Luncheons sponsored by the Milwaukee Press Club. At those events, which are open to the public, a fee is charged -- for the lunch. Ryan’s office said the Whitnall club meeting was the only event the congressman had scheduled during the August break that involved a charge. We found two other paid events, one each from Ribble and Duffy. Ribble’s office said he participated in the Aug. 8 forum addressing regulation with two other local civic groups. "I believe it was at lunchtime and there was a cost for the lunch," said Ribble spokeswoman Ashley Olson. Duffy participated in one event -- an Aug. 18, 2011 small business forum at the University of Wisconsin-Superior -- where participants were charged $15 for lunch and materials. So, each of the three GOP congressmen singled out had at least one event where a fee was charged. But such appearances are routine tor politicians of both parties, the fee covered lunch and did not go to the congressman. The thrust of the statement, though, was broader still -- that the three were "shutting down" town hall meetings and thus the ability to talk to the elected official. Here’s what we found about the summer recess schedule for each when we asked aides, checked public schedules and looked at news accounts: Ryan: Toured various local businesses, held "multiple hour-long meetings" with small business owners, Realtors and home builders. In addition to the "telephone town hall meeting," attended the Walworth County Fair, a Boy Scout lunch and a 75th anniversary lunch for Kenosha Beef. Constituents could contact Ryan’s office for an appointment to meet with him in his office, said spokesman Conor Sweeney. Ryan was on vacation in Colorado for part of the month. Ribble: Held a three-hour "Conversations with your Congressman" on Aug. 13, 2011 -- 10 minute one-on-one meetings; attended an Aug. 12, 2011 forum on transportation; an Alzheimers Association public input session, and a forum with seniors about Medicare. Duffy: Like many House members with large districts, Duffy maintains a mobile office, and its schedule is listed prominently on the congressman’s web page. Duffy himself is on the bus some, but not all, of the time, said Brandon Moody, chief of staff. Moody said Duffy has spent the entire August break in his northern Wisconsin district. Including the town meeting in Wausau, he held a half dozen coffees and, yes, community town hall meetings. He also visited county fairs and toured area businesses. No fee was charged for any of these events, or for access to the congressman. Our conclusion: The state Democrats say that three Republican congressmen from Wisconsin are shutting down town hall meetings or making constituents pay to attend them. Yet all three had town hall meetings or participated in a forum -- in person, or by phone -- before the statement was made. And one, Duffy, participated in several town hall meetings. In fact, one review showed many members of Congress did not have any town hall meetings -- and Democrats were less likely than Republicans to hold them. What’s more, the party provided no evidence Ryan or the others were not available to constituents during the break. Finally, the assertion that appearing at a Rotary lunch that is open to the public is "charging constituents" for access is far off the mark. The party’s claim is not only false, but ridiculously so. It’s Pants on Fire.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2011-09-06T09:00:00	2011-08-17	['Sean_Duffy', 'United_States']
pomt-10810	"When I was mayor of New York City, I encouraged adoptions. Adoptions went up 65-70 percent. Abortions went down 16 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/28/rudy-giuliani/thats-one-way-to-slice-the-numbers-there-are-other/	In early August, 2007, Rudy Giuliani announced he was making "12 Commitments to the American People," including a pledge to "increase adoptions, decrease abortions and protect the quality of life for our children." It's a point he has made before. During the May 3, 2007, Republican debate, he said this: "When I was mayor of New York City, I encouraged adoptions. Adoptions went up 65-70 percent; abortions went down 16 percent." Indeed, abortions in Gotham declined 16.8 percent during Giuliani's eight-year tenure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But his claims about adoptions are far less clear-cut. The campaign didn't offer any research showing that rising adoption rates cause lower abortion rates, and we couldn't find any, either. Two years into his first term, Giuliani created the Administration for Children's Services with a mission to improve the lives of the city's children. The agency aims to help kids in foster care, and it measures its success in large part by how many adoptions it facilitates each year. We focus on page 14 of the ACS 2003 Year End Review, which shows a bar chart of adoptions conducted through the city's child welfare system from 1989 to 2003. Giuliani was mayor from Jan. 1, 1994, to Dec. 31, 2001. His new agency came on line in January 1996. The chart shows a gradual increase in adoptions from 1989 through 1994, then a steeper increase through 1997 — the middle years of Giuliani's tenure. After that year, the numbers decline through 2002. Giuliani arrives at his 65 to 70 percent increase by taking adoption rates for the six years before ACS was created and comparing them to the six years after. That's one way to look at it, but it conceals some things. For instance, the chart shows that if you simply compare adoption rates in the first year of his tenure and in the last year, the rate increased by only 17 percent, a point made by our friends at FactCheck.org. Averaging the rates over two six-year blocks helps smooth out peaks and valleys in individual years caused by social, economic and other forces, campaign aides said. The first two years after ACS came on line, there was a spike in adoptions that Giuliani's campaign said was because of a backlog of foster kids waiting to connect with families. Then, the numbers leveled off. It's true, the aides say, the numbers go down significantly in Giuliani's final two years. But they're still higher than those of his predecessor, David Dinkins. More recently, Giuliani has used a much more flattering number than the one he started with. His staff compared adoptions in all eight of his fiscal years against all eight of his predecessors'. This works out to a whopping 133 percent increase in adoptions. So which number is it? Something's wrong if voters have to ask. When a statistic seems to go in so many directions, the best approach is an apples to apples one. For its abortion statistic, the Guiliani campaign looked at two points in time (the beginning and end of his tenure) and compared the two. Doing that for adoptions yields an increase of 17 percent. So, he's got his numbers right on abortion rates, but he has inflated the adoption figures by getting too fancy with his math. We find his overall claim half-true. UPDATE: We've corrected the launch date for the Administration for Children's Services. We mistakenly said 2006 when we should have said 1996.

pomt-01052	"America is No. 1 in wind power."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/america-no-1-wind-power-obama-says/	President Barack Obama devoted a portion of his State of the Union address to talking up America’s energy trends, including being a leader in our own energy production. "We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet," he said. "And today, America is No. 1 in oil and gas. America is No. 1 in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008." We’ve covered oil and gas and solar power before, but the wind energy claim was new to us. Is the United States the global leader in producing that, as well, or is Obama just being a blowhard? Let’s get on the grid and find out. Clearing the air Obama has made renewable power sources a focus of his administration, and has effectively doubled the use of many "clean energy" methods, a large portion of which has been from wind. The U.S. Energy Department says that the nation’s capacity for generating energy from wind, in which wind moves a turbine to generate electricity to be used on the power grid, has increased from 25,410 megawatts in 2008 to 62,300 megawatts as of September 2014. This capacity growth was fueled in part to a federal production tax credit that expired at the end of 2014. There are still projects being built using the tax credit, so capacity is expected to keep growing. Many energy reports, however, generally say the United States trails China in its total wind energy capacity. The Global Wind Energy Council said in 2013 that China has the capacity to generate 91,412 megawatts. China also has outpaced the United States for wind-driven power installations. But that’s where we run into a headwind on the stats, because there’s a difference between capacity (what can be produced) and generation (what actually is produced). A Jan. 15, 2015, report by the American Wind Energy Association said the electrical energy actually being produced was currently greater in the United States than it was in China, and has been since 2008. The report said in 2013 the United States generated 167 billion kilowatt hours (a measure utility companies use to bill companies; a megawatt equals 1,000 kilowatts), while China generated 138 billion kilowatt hours. Simon Mahan, renewable energy manager for the pro-renewable Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said there a many factors in determining the two different measurements, leading to discrepancies depending on how they’re recorded. A wind farm in America may be more efficient than one in China because the wind is better, for example, making more power even if the one in China has more turbines. The focus on installations is due in part to the fixed capital costs of building a wind farm, and full-year generation data isn’t available if, say, an installation opens in April, Mahan said. He compared capacity and generation to how a hybrid car’s gasoline tank is smaller than a truck’s, but both can go about the same distance because the hybrid is more efficient. Whether this difference lasts is up in the air. China has plans to build 150 gigawatts (that’s 150,000 megawatts) of capacity by 2017. in the third quarter of 2014, the U.S. had an additional 13,600 megawatts of capacity under construction, which would bump the States up to around 75,000 megawatts of capacity next year, with potential projects in the future. Determining if either country maxes out that capacity depends on factors that can only be predicted and not confirmed, Mahan said, although China has issues with how much its power grid can safely hold at one time. The International Energy Agency has predicted the demand for wind power in China is slowing, while the United States faces "policy uncertainty" that may affect wind power’s future here. Our ruling Obama said "America is No. 1 in wind power." China is actually the leader in the overall capacity for generating wind power. But the United States has overtaken China in terms of the actual amount of electricity wind power it generates. Both countries plan to continue to expand wind capacity -- China more than the United States -- but they also both face challenges to expanding capacity and generation. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12795	"The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville."	mostly false	/california/statements/2017/feb/16/travis-allen/examining-claim-about-oroville-dam-spillway/	Republican state Assemblyman Travis Allen recently claimed the Oroville Dam emergency in Northern California "was entirely avoidable." The Orange County lawmaker also blamed Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown for the crisis. "The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville," Allen said in a press release on Feb. 13, 2017. Allen posted similar claims on Twitter and Facebook the same day. The problems at the Oroville dam are complex. And so is Allen’s claim. We’ll break his statement into parts and assess its overall accuracy. 1) The Oroville dam failure was "entirely avoidable." Let’s be clear: The dam itself hasn’t failed. But its main concrete spillway developed a gaping hole in early February 2017 that led officials to dial back water flows to avoid further damage. As stormwater and runoff continued to flow in, however, the reservoir overtopped its emergency spillway for the first time in its 48-year history. The emergency spillway includes a concrete lip at the top and wooded hillside below without concrete fortification. Rapid erosion took place on Feb. 12, 2017 as water rushed down that unprotected hillside, leading to fears of a major dam breach and forcing the evacuation of nearly 200,000 residents downriver. Authorities lifted the mandatory evacuation orders two days later, though concerns over the dam’s safety are expected to continue for months. Environmental groups warned in October 2005, when the dam was up for a federal license renewal before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, that the emergency spillway needed to be armored with concrete to avoid a crisis such as the one that played out this week. And a November 2005 Sacramento Bee article quoted state water officials as saying "Our facilities, including the (emergency) spillway, are safe during any conceivable flood event." The issue of fortifying that hillside "was brought up in the FERC proceeding," Lester Snow, who was director of the state Department of Water Resources from 2004 through 2009, told PolitiFact California this week. "And I believe FERC, as well as DWR engineers, looked at that and did not consider it to be the kind of threat that it has turned out to be." "I guess (there’s) some credence," to the idea that the crisis was avoidable, Snow said. "(But) again, we would not have gotten there had it not had the surprising and dramatic failure of the (main) concrete gated spillway." The main spillway had passed federal and state inspections and those who manage it "saw nothing that would have predicted such a failure in the concrete chute," said Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the Brown Administration’s Natural Resources Agency. 2) "California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014" California voters did, indeed, pass a $7.5 billion water bond known as Proposition 1 in 2014. It was approved at the height of the state’s severe drought with the goal of expanding California’s water storage capacity and improving water quality. It included $2.7 billion for new surface and groundwater storage projects. 3) "But Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 (from the bond) on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville." Again, there’s some truth in this part of Allen’s statement. But there’s also a lot of context missing. State officials said Oroville and other existing State Water Projects are not eligible for Proposition 1 money. Upkeep on the massive system of state reservoirs, dams and aqueducts is paid for by the 29 state water contractors who consume the water, including urban and agricultural water districts. Asked about using Proposition 1 money for Oroville, H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, said: "You couldn’t have done it if you wanted to." Allen’s additional claim that Brown hasn’t spent any of that bond money on new water storage is also problematic. A spokeswoman for Allen pointed to a state website that tracks Proposition 1 funding and shows none has been allocated for water storage projects. Brown Administration officials countered that Proposition 1 was not intended to pay for projects overnight. It was a forward-looking measure that aimed to expand and strengthen the state’s water system for future droughts. Vogel, of the state’s Natural Resources Agency, said Allen ignores the fact that "the storage funding section of the bond precluded any money being spent until December 15, 2016. Travis Allen should remember this since he voted for the water bond," in the Legislature. The bond passed the Assembly with support from all but two members. Voters then approved it during the November 2014 election. The state expects applications for new water storage projects to be submitted later this year. The California Water Commission plans to award early funding for storage projects in 2018, Vogel said. Our ruling Assemblyman Travis Allen recently claimed: "The Oroville dam failure was entirely avoidable: California passed a $7.5 Billion water bond in 2014 but Jerry Brown didn't spend $1 on new water storage or improvements to existing infrastructure like Oroville." State officials say there was no indication of problems with the dam’s main spillway, which developed a huge hole this week as officials released large amounts of water from the dam. Officials did, however, have warnings about the integrity of the dam’s emergency spillway, which experienced rapid erosion this week, triggering mass evacuations below the dam. Environmental groups warned in 2005 that the emergency spillway needed to be reinforced. Given those warnings, there’s some truth to Allen’s claim that the crisis could have been avoided. But there’s no evidence, at this point, that state officials knew the dam’s main spillway was in jeopardy, something Allen does not point out. Allen’s other assertion that Gov. Jerry Brown hasn't spent a single dollar from the state’s recent $7.5 billion water bond on Oroville also doesn’t tell the whole story. That dam, and all others along the State Water Project, are ineligible for those funds. Allen's additional claim that the state has yet to spend bond money on new water storage projects, ignores the fact that that money was precluded from being spent until December 2016. There’s no doubt there’s been a massive failure at Oroville. But Allen doesn’t prove the emergency was "entirely avoidable," particularly given the restrictions on state water bond money.

pomt-14228	About "1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/15/hillary-clinton/about-1-gun-sellers-responsible-more-half-guns-use/	When Hillary Clinton brought her presidential campaign to Milwaukee’s Tabernacle Community Baptist Church on March 29, 2016, she participated in a forum on gun violence with U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, and others. The Democratic front runner spoke softly as she recounted a number of fatal firearms encounters, in Milwaukee and across the country. Then she raised her voice as she presented some of her gun control policy proposals. And she made a claim that we want to check about guns used in crimes. "The availability of guns has gone way too far. And the fact that gun-makers and -sellers are immune from liability …. Gwen will talk about what we need to do to stop some of these gun sellers," Clinton said. "About, what, 1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes. So, we've got our work cut out for us. But let's not grow weary doing good, because in due time we will harvest if we stay focused." We found there is some truth in Clinton’s 1 percent claim, but several significant caveats. Old data Experts told us the latest federal report that gets at Clinton’s claim, from 2000, is from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Relying on gun tracing data, the report found that 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for more than 57 percent of the crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998. So, Clinton’s claim might generally appear correct in terms of the figures. But there are a few things to tease out. 1. Clinton made her claim in the present tense and is relying on the latest, best data available -- but that data is 18 years old. The experts told us that ever since federal law was changed in 2003, tracing data has essentially dried up. That was when Congress approved the so-called Tiahrt Amendment, named for its original sponsor, U.S. Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan. It forbids the ATF from sharing information about guns it has traced with state and local police agencies except in the course of a criminal investigation. The change "greatly restricted" the release of crime gun trace data by the ATF, restricted access by researchers and plaintiff trial attorneys, and restricted what reports the ATF could issue themselves, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. 2. Clinton’s claim was about "guns used in crimes," while the 2000 report referred to "crime guns." There’s a slight difference. Harvard University professor of health policy David Hemenway, who does research on firearms, told us that most any gun seized by police is considered a crime gun. That would include, of course, seized guns that were used in crimes, but also guns found by police that couldn’t be traced to particular crimes. 3. In referring to the 1 percent of gun dealers, Clinton said they were "responsible" for more than half of the guns used in crimes. But that doesn’t mean a gun used in a crime came directly from the dealer. Hemenway said that authorities trace crime guns to their original seller, but can’t necessarily determine whether other transactions of the gun were made prior to it being used in a crime. In other words, it’s possible to trace a crime gun to the store that originally sold it, but that gun might have changed hands any number of times -- legally or illegally -- before it was used in a crime. On the other hand, said Webster, gun dealers "are one of the most important, if not the most important, conduit for guns into the underground market." So, there is rationale for targeting gun sellers linked to crime guns to prevent, for example, purchases by a straw buyer -- a person who legally purchases a gun in order to turns it over to someone who cannot legally purchase one. (Tracing helped establish that a suburban Milwaukee gun store was a top seller of crime guns locally for more than a decade.) Our rating Clinton said about "1 percent of all the gun sellers are responsible for more than half of the guns that are used in crimes." The best data essentially backs up the claim, but it is from 1998. It’s also worth noting that the traces go back to the original seller of a crime gun and don’t take into account whether there were other transactions before a particular gun was used in a crime. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information -- our definition of Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-15T10:00:00	2016-03-29	['None']
pomt-06411	On using Gov. Scott Walker’s collective-bargaining limits to help balance the city of Milwaukee budget	no flip	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/27/tom-barrett/using-gov-scott-walkers-collective-bargaining-limi/	When Republican Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his controversial curbs on collective bargaining, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett blasted away. Milwaukee, Barrett said, could get health and pension concessions from public employees at the bargaining table without "attacking" workers’ rights and trying to "obliterate" people. The mayor, who ran against Walker in the 2010 election, backed the decision by Senate Democrats to flee to Illinois to block a quorum on Walker’s bill. Eight months later, the Democratic mayor took advantage of a key plank in Walker’s bill to help save millions on health insurance costs and balance the city budget without having to negotiate with city unions. In the past, the city would have had to negotiate such a change. Not after Walker’s move. As the Milwaukee Common Council considers Barrett’s budget proposal, and some in labor launch barbs at him, it seems like a good time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter. First, our requisite reminder: The Flip-O-Meter measures whether a political figure has changed positions. It does not evaluate whether any move is good politics or good policy. Some will see a change as being open to new ideas, others as political pandering. Now, a brief history lesson: On Feb. 11, 2011, Walker introduced what became Act 10, the historic budget-repair bill that required state employees to pay more for health insurance and pensions, as part of his move to take away most collective bargaining rights from most public workers. Protesters flocked to Madison and occupied the Capitol rotunda for weeks. The bill also extended the state-employee benefit cuts to local municipalities and schools by taking health and pension out of bargaining for most unions at the local level as well. The law requires local communities whose employees are in the state health plan for local governments to move to start charging employees 12 percent toward health care premiums. Milwaukee is not in that plan, so it was free to set whatever level of cost sharing it wanted. These "tools," Walker said, would help local governments make up for the big cuts in local education and municipal aid he proposed March 1, 2011, to close a $3 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget. So, did Barrett change his position by using one of the "tools" that the bill handed to local governments? We reviewed Barrett’s public statements and actions as recorded in dozens of news stories, speeches and press conferences in 2011. Barrett immediately started a nuanced two-step dance in his public statements -- objecting to some parts of the proposal while saying other parts were necessary. Let’s start with whether Barrett’s rhetoric was consistent, before comparing his deeds to his words. The approach toward unions: Barrett, who was supported by nearly all public unions except police and fire in the 2010 governor’s race, made clear he thought Walker overreached with some of Act 10 in ways that Barrett saw as union busting. Walker wanted to make it harder for unions to collect dues and remain certified, as well as eliminate nearly all collective bargaining -- moves that some said would shrink unions into irrelevance or put them out of business. Walker was messing with "the fundamental right to organize," Barrett said within days of Walker’s February announcement. "It’s an ideological war to try to crush labor," Barrett said a few weeks later when interviewed on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show on March 7, 2011. Barrett didn’t specify which of the bill’s provisions he felt crossed the line into union busting. But he made clear he believed he could have used the "rough and tumble" of collective bargaining with unions to get concessions similar to what Walker wanted. Impact on city budget: Barrett predicted that Milwaukee’s budget would come out a big loser due to the aid cuts in Walker’s two-year budget. He said in March that the combination of aid cuts, rising expenses, a levy freeze and exempting public safety workers from benefit changes "just makes our structural deficit explode." Walker said just the opposite, and he was right: By August, city estimates showed a potential gain of at least $11 million from the two separate state budget bills. Most of the savings, the Journal Sentinel reported in August, could come from health care benefit changes that Barrett didn't have to negotiate with unions -- thanks to Walker’s changes. So we saw Barrett criticizing the bill in pretty stark terms -- inaccurately in one case. But he liked some of it, and even wanted more. Here’s where this gets interesting. Paying more: The mayor -- early and often -- said public employees would have to pay more, needed to pay more, and the public wanted them to pay more. It’s notable that Barrett said that even before the big public unions publicly said they would swallow Walker’s financial demands if he dropped the limits on bargaining. With an eye on solving his own budget problems, Barrett said Feb. 22, 2011, that he’d support city employees paying the same higher contributions as state workers. He even credited Walker for paving the way by getting a "mandate" in his election win for raising state pension and health contributions. And the mayor sought to push state lawmakers to go even further than Walker, who had proposed exempting public safety unions from the collective bargaining limits. He called on lawmakers to subject police and fire unions to the same bargaining limits as other public employee unions so the sacrifice could be shared among all workers. Barrett minced no words. He said the law enforcement retirement and health benefits were "Cadillac." The mayor went further. As the standoff with AWOL Democrats continued over Walker’s bill, Barrett called Feb. 24, 2011, for an "alternative" to Walker’s bill. Specifically, he said the GOP should set aside the sharp limits on union bargaining and just vote on requiring the benefits changes. As the Journal Sentinel reported, Barrett would "impose the health care and pension changes and extend those changes to all public employees, leaving the rest of the budget-repair bill's provisions for separate debate later." He also asked Republican lawmakers to require city of Milwaukee workers to pay 12 percent of their health premiums -- just as Walker was proposing for state employees and some municipal workers not in Milwaukee. Mandate the benefits changes at a specific level? That would mean having the state dictate what amount Milwaukee workers should pay. That’s a far cry from local collective bargaining and would have taken away some flexibility on letting some communities decide what to impose. Was Barrett sending out mixed signals -- criticizing excessive excessive limits on collective bargaining, while he endorsed scrapping them for health care, one of the biggest-ticket items? Barrett told us his statements were not meant to endorse limits on health care bargaining. When we asked how else his proposal would have imposed greater health contributions on local workers, he said he was only trying to goad GOP legislators and Walker into a separate vote on the limits. Enough with the words. Now let’s look at Barrett’s deeds in summer and fall of 2011, when it came time to decide whether to use the "tools." In September 2011, as he prepared his budget proposal, Barrett was free to impose more health-care cost sharing because the GOP had removed it as a mandatory subject of bargaining by the budget-repair bill. He did so, at basically the same level as the bill required for state employees (12 percent). It was a big key to balancing his budget while avoiding major cuts. He also followed through on his promise to get the police and fire unions -- with whom he still has to bargain -- to agree or to consider paying more towards health insurance. He also offered them a wage increase for 2012. Police supervisors and firefighters ratified the deal; rank and file police rejected it. Barrett shied away from crediting Walker, citing the city’s past success getting employee unions to agree to pay more. This sequence of events rubbed the city’s biggest labor union the wrong way. Barrett gave "lip service" to opposing Walker’s bill but then exploited it," says Rich Abelson, executive director of AFSCME District Council 48. And Marty Beil, head of the biggest state employee union, said labor would not back Barrett in a possible recall election because there’s no difference between Barrett and the governor. Said Abelson: "If you don’t want to screw your employees, don’t screw your employees." Barrett told us he was just dealing with reality. He felt it was either eliminate 300-400 city jobs and trim key services due to the state budget’s cuts -- or use the help Walker provided. "It’s a real world issue," he said. So where does it land on the Flip-O-Meter? Abelson calls Barrett’s actions opportunistic. We see some irony here, and a heavy does of Realpolitik. But Barrett made very clear early on that he wanted the same concessions Walker was seeking -- and applied to a broader group. So it’s not really a surprise that ultimately he grabbed the chance once he and other Dems lost the battle over the union-power items. And while his messages on the union power issues crossed wires at times, his statements from the start signalled he was willing to be seen as ready to impose benefits changes. The union’s disgust over Barrett’s position underscores that. The Flip-O-Meter defines a No Flip as "no substantial change in position." That fits the bill here.

pomt-00786	Seventy percent of Americans "don't have a college degree."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/08/rick-santorum/70-americans-dont-have-college-degree-rick-santoru/	Rick Santorum, a potential candidate for president in 2016, argues that the Republican Party is not offering enough for America’s workers. The former senator from Pennsylvania said Republicans need to improve in reaching out to these voters on CBS’s Face the Nation on April 5, 2015. "I think people are looking for someone to bring us together. And I put a book out last year called Blue Collar Conservatives, and it's the whole idea that we have to start bringing those who are being left behind by this economy. We have to give them an opportunity to be able to reach that American dream again. And I think Republicans, frankly, have been very weak on that," Santorum said. After mentioning that Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, did not do a great job in reaching out to the working class, Santorum added: "I think there's a lot of folks who are very disenchanted with both political parties because neither party is really talking about them and really saying what's the way forward for the 70 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree but, you know, want economic opportunity like everybody else and nobody's talking about that." We wondered whether Santorum is correct that 70 percent of Americans don’t have a college degree. We checked with Santorum’s staff of his organization Patriot Voices, and they sent us an article from Vox about Scott Walker’s lack of a college diploma. The reporter argues that not having a college degree does not really matter since "most Americans — nearly 70 percent — don't have a bachelor's degree, either." The article doesn’t give a source for its number. We decided to look for data about educational attainment from the U.S. Census Bureau; we found 2014 data (the most recent available) on the U.S. population by age, race and gender. We focused on the age group of 25 years and over, because most American students graduate by the time they turn 25. According to census data, 209.3 million people in the United States are 25 years old or older, and 66.9 million have a bachelor’s degree or higher (such as a master’s, professional or doctoral degree). That means about 68 percent of them do not have a bachelor’s degree. If we include people who have an academic associate degree -- about 11.7 million people -- the percentage of people without a degree declines slightly, to 62 percent. The U.S. Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics looked at the same question in a 2014 longitudinal study that followed young people to age 27. It found that by that age, 72 percent of respondents did not have bachelor's degrees. Our ruling In making the point that Republicans need to reach out to the working class more, Santorum said that 70 percent of Americans don’t have a college degree. We found several measures that are close to the number Santorum cited. Overall, we rate his claim True. Correction, Apr. 14, 2015: We rated this statement True, but due to a production error, we initially published our fact-check with a logo that mistakenly indicated that we had rated it Mostly True. We have fixed that logo. In addition, we have updated the math from our original version to include people who have a higher degree above a bachelor’s. The new data doesn’t change the rating, which remains True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2015-04-08T10:00:00	2015-04-05	['United_States']
pomt-04126	Says a federal plan to expand Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over 10 years.	false	/florida/statements/2013/jan/08/rick-scott/rick-scott-ignores-flaws-state-study-says-medicaid/	Gov. Rick Scott is using a questionable state "study" as evidence that the federal health care law will cost the state billions of additional dollars. In an guest editorial written for the Tampa Bay Times on Sunday, and again on Monday during a Washington, D.C., press conference, Scott cited a state analysis that says the health care law would cost Florida taxpayers $26 billion over the next 10 years. The money would be needed, Scott says, to pay for expanding Medicaid, a government-run health insurance program for the poor. "As you know Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration put out their estimate of what the expansion would cost just for Florida taxpayers and it's over $26 billion," Scott told Washington reporters after meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Don’t believe that number. In this case, the Agency for Health Care Administration -- an agency Scott directs -- did indeed release a presentation that concluded that Florida taxpayers would be asked to pay $25.8 billion over 10 years to implement an expansion of the Medicaid system. But the state study relies on questionable or downright misleading assumptions to reach its eye-popping figure. We can’t say what the cost will be to the state -- and if there will even be one. Outside groups such as the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, have estimated the additional cost to the state would be a little more than $1 billion between 2013 and 2022. The state figure, however, ignores a fundamental component of the health care law -- namely that the federal government will pay for most of the expansion. This requires a little bit of explanation, so bear with us. One of the key components of the new federal law, and one of the components that Scott and Republicans particularly dislike, is that most Americans will be required to have some form of health insurance or pay a penalty. As a result, the federal government wants to expand Medicaid coverage to cover more Americans who are poor. States, which manage Medicaid, can decide whether to expand the program or not, but to make the option enticing, the federal government offered to pick up most of the costs to cover more people. Over the past 20 years, the federal government has paid for about 58 percent of the costs for current Medicaid recipients. Under the expansion, the government would pay 100 percent of the costs for newly eligible Medicaid recipients for the first three years (2014-16). In 2017, the federal government would cover 95 percent of the costs, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond. Why is this breakdown so important? Because the state study ignores it completely. The state study calculates the cost of the expansion based on the federal government paying for only about 58 percent of the costs. Also, the most recent cost estimate from the state -- which was published in December -- includes revisions that only add to the theoretical state bill, according to our analysis. Among them: • In a January 2012 report, the state assumed people who are now eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled would slowly transition into the health care program over a period of three years. In the most recent report, the state said they would all enter Medicaid immediately. • Similarly, the January 2012 report concluded that just 40 percent of newly eligible Medicaid recipients would enter the system in 2014. By December 2012, the number had been revised up to 60 percent. It’s hard to quantify the dollar impact on any one change based on the information provided by the state in its estimates. When we asked for details on these assumptions, Michelle Dahnke, a spokesperson for the Agency for Health Care Administration, said the state simply wanted to be as cautious as possible with its estimates. But state officials were aware that the estimates were off even as Scott repeated the numbers in Washington, according to emails obtained by Carol Gentry of Health News Florida, part of WUSF Media. The Health News Florida report noted that J. Eric Pridgeon, on the staff of the House Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee, questioned the study almost immediately. On Dec. 20, three days after the study was released, Pridgeon wrote state agency officials saying that the federal revenues for Medicaid expansion are part of the Affordable Care Act and cannot be omitted. In response to criticism of the estimates, Scott spokesperson Melissa Sellers issued a statement defending them but noting, "Others have asked AHCA to use different assumptions to calculate different cost estimates. We look forward to reviewing those cost estimates as well." The inflated estimates seem to be part of a pattern. Last summer, Scott claimed a Medicaid expansion would cost $1.9 billion a year. PolitiFact Florida looked into that number at the time and concluded that the estimate "appears to be wildly high." We rated his statement False. Our ruling There is no doubt that Medicaid represents a significant part of the state’s budget, and that any plan to expand the system -- no matter how much the federal government pays for -- could include additional costs to the state. But rather than have a fact-based discussion about the state’s responsibilities when it comes to health care, it appears that Scott and his staff are making strange assumptions to make the estimates higher than they actually will be. This is also a case where Scott cannot simply hide behind the fact that he is accurately citing a "study." His office directed the analysis, and it was notified that the assumptions were questionable. Scott gets a pass on one thing: The cost to expand Medicaid is largely unknown. But using a study to say that the expansion of Medicaid would cost Florida taxpayers "over $26 billion" is False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2013-01-08T18:09:22	2013-01-07	['None']
pomt-10716	"If Sen. Hillary Clinton could enact all of her campaign proposals, taxpayers would be faced with financing more than $777.6-billion in new spending over one White House term."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/26/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-number-crunchers-crunch-hillary-accurately/	Attempting to portray Hillary Clinton as a big spender, the Republican National Committee recently unveiled a "Spend-O-Meter" to tally up Clinton's policy proposals. "If Sen. Hillary Clinton could enact all of her campaign proposals, taxpayers would be faced with financing more than $777.6-billion in new spending over one White House term," the RNC says on its Web site, where the meter is prominently featured. Putting the RNC's Spend-O-Meter to the Truth-O-Meter test, we find the Republicans are doing a reasonably good job of accounting for Clinton's spending proposals. In 19 out of 24 examples cited by the RNC, the Spend-O-Meter correctly explained Clinton's proposals. However, in one case, the RNC includes $80-billion baby bond proposal that Clinton quickly dropped after talking about it. Since Clinton never formally proposed the idea, you can subtract $80-billion from the $777.6-billion. We realize the RNC had to make some assumptions to keep the arithmetic simple. For instance, their calculations assume that each program becomes law at the very start of Clinton's first term, allowing the Spend-O-Meter to add things up over four full years. Of course, it can't really happen that way, but for purposes of keeping tabs on the cost of Clinton's proposals it's within reason. It's also true that the RNC doesn't note that some of Clinton's proposals, already in legislation in Congress, have drawn the support of some Republicans. Still, as gimmicks go, this one stays close enough to the facts to rate a Mostly True.

pomt-08513	"Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships."	true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/06/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-tones-down-rhetoric-not-attacks-new-a/	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson is continuing his pointed attacks against Republican opponent Daniel Webster, and Webster's stance on women's issues. Only this time, he's ditching the lines about religious fanaticism and the comparisons to the Taliban. Grayson, a Democrat from Orlando, caught flak for airing an ad that compared Webster's beliefs to those of the Taliban, and for distorting Webster's words in a speech Webster gave to a Christian group. Grayson played clips in a 30-second ad called "Taliban Dan Webster" that showed Webster saying wives should submit to their husbands. But an unedited clip of the speech showed that Webster was in fact telling husbands to love their wives. The distortion, which earned a False rating from PolitiFact Florida, gave Webster's campaign national attention (including tweets of support from Sarah Palin) and helped him raise more than $100,000 in 48 hours, his campaign said. In response, Grayson released a toned-down version of the "Taliban Dan" ad on Oct. 6, 2010, called "The Facts." Gone are the terrorists holding machine guns, the people burning American flags and the women wearing burqas. Also gone are references to religious fanaticism, Iran and the Bible. (Gone, too, we found, is the "Taliban Dan Webster" ad from Grayson's YouTube website. The video is now marked private.) Here's a transcript of the new ad: Daniel Webster's Washington backers are attacking Alan Grayson on women's issues. The facts on Webster's record: Fact: Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships. Fact: Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home. Fact: Webster would force victims of rape and incest to bear their attacker's child. Those are the facts. Don't let Daniel Webster make the laws we will have to live with. In another item, we're analyzing the claim that Webster is an advocate for a group that teaches that mothers should not work outside the home. In this fact check, we'll focus on the first "Fact" -- that Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships. It's a slightly different take on a claim in the first ad when Grayson claimed that Webster "wants to make divorce illegal," even for abused women. Both claims track back to a piece of legislation Webster introduced as a member of the state House in 1990. That year, Webster authored HB 1585, a bill that "creates a form of marriage known as 'covenant marriage,' which may be dissolved only on grounds of adultery." Florida law then and now allows married couples to divorce if a court finds that the marriage is "irretrievably broken." It's a common standard throughout the country, often called no-fault divorce. The term can be interpreted broadly and critics say the standard of proof makes divorce too easy. Webster's legislation sought to make getting a divorce more difficult, at least for couples that voluntarily entered the covenant marriage. Here's what he proposed. Men and women would have the option on their application for a marriage license to elect a covenant marriage. Under terms of the covenant marriage agreement, the husband- and wife-to-be would have to have their parents' permission and attend premarital counseling by a member of the clergy or a marriage counselor before proceeding. As part of their marriage license, the husband and wife would then have to sign notarized documents declaring: "I, (insert name), do hereby declare my intent to enter in Covenant Marriage. I do so with the full understanding that a Covenant Marriage may not be dissolved except by reason of adultery. I have attended premarital counseling in good faith and understand my responsibilities to the marriage. I promise to seek counsel in times of trouble. I believe that I have chosen my life-mate wisely and have disclosed to him or her all facts that may adversely affect his or her decision to enter in this covenant with me." Once a couple agreed to a covenant marriage, the only way they could get a divorce is for adultery. That means physical or sexual abuse was not grounds for a divorce. Webster's legislation went nowhere in Florida -- Democrats controlled the state House in 1990, and the bill never came up for a vote -- but it did help launch the movement for covenant marriage nationwide. Three states -- Louisiana, Arkansas and Arizona -- adopted a version of Webster's law, though the laws on the books in those states were all less restrictive than what Webster proposed in Florida, said Alan J. Hawkins, a professor of Family Life at Brigham Young University and an expert on covenant marriage. In his first ad, "Taliban Dan Webster," Grayson said that Webster "wants to make divorce illegal," even for abused women. But as our research proves, Webster's bill wouldn't make all divorce illegal. Rather it would make divorce more difficult, but not impossible, for couples who chose to form a covenant marriage. Even couples who chose Webster's form of covenant marriage had a small window out for adultery. We rated Grayson's original claim Half True. It appears the Grayson campaign listened. In his new ad, "The Facts," Grayson says "Webster sponsored a bill to create a form of marriage that would trap women in abusive relationships." In 1990, Webster sponsored HB 1585, which would create a new form of marriage called covenant marriage. If women agreed to form a covenant marriage, they would not be allowed to divorce because of physical or sexual abuse. The only out under Webster's legislation was adultery. We rate this updated claim True.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2010-10-06T17:58:23	2010-10-06	['None']
pomt-09568	"President Obama pledged to go through the budget 'line by line,' but on his watch, non-defense spending has spiraled out of control, increasing by 67 percent in the last year alone."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/john-boehner/boehner-says-spending-has-grown-67-percent-obamas-/	One of the most reliable Republican attacks on President Barack Obama has been that he and his allies in Congress are spending too much of the taxpayers' money. In his live-blogging response to Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 27, 2010, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, criticized Obama's handling of the federal budget by playing off Obama's proposed freeze on domestic spending. "President Obama pledged to go through the budget 'line by line,' " Boehner wrote, "but on his watch, nondefense spending has spiraled out of control, increasing by 67 percent in the last year alone." Analyzing the accuracy of this comment requires an immersion in budget wonkery. Specifically, determining whether Boehner is right depends heavily on whether you are talking about "budget authority" or "outlays." When Congress approves budget authority, it confers the right to spend money for a certain purpose. But for various reasons, that money may not be spent during the fiscal year when it is authorized. For instance, a given program may take longer than expected to get up and running, employees may not be hired immediately, or, most commonly, lawmakers may intend for the spending to be made in subsequent years. The actual money spent in a given year is referred to as "outlays." Let's look at the the various ways to calculate the numbers that Boehner cited. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the federal budget authority for nondefense, discretionary spending in fiscal year 2008 -- the last year under President George W. Bush -- was $494 billion. (Discretionary spending refers to funds appropriated on an annual basis by Congress, while mandatory spending -- a separate category -- includes required programs such as Social Security, as well as interest on the federal debt.) The budget authority for nondefense, discretionary spending in 2009 -- including budget authority from the 2009 stimulus bill -- was $803 billion. That's an increase of about 63 percent -- quite close to what Boehner's blog post suggested. But not all the budget authority conveyed by the stimulus bill was exercised in 2009. In fact, of the $268 billion in budget authority conveyed for 2009, only about $35 billion was actually spent in 2009, or roughly 13 percent of the total budget authority. So if you remove from the calculations the unspent budget authority from the stimulus -- sticking instead to the nondefense discretionary outlays in both the regular budget and the stimulus -- the increase from 2008 to 2009 was 11.3 percent. That's quite a bit less than what was suggested by Boehner's blog post. "It's very misleading," said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. He said Boehner essentially took more than one year's expenditures and counted them in a single year. We talked to Boehner's office, and staffers acknowledged that the congressman's phrasing could have been more accurate. But they maintained that their larger point holds. "Congressional Democrats voted to increase spending by 67 percent," Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. "That’s the way the American people understand it. You can quibble about the arcana of budget wonk terminology, but they voted to spend the money, and we’re very comfortable using that figure." Boehner gets some outside backup. Brian Riedl, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that calculating budget authority is not totally out of left field. It's a "measure of congressional intent," he said. But because Boehner wrote that nondefense spending "has spiraled out of control," to use numbers that refer to budget authority are, at best, misleading. In this case, the difference between those two methods isn't trivial, thanks to the unusual circumstances of a massive, multiyear spending bill being passed in 2009. In essence, calculating it Boehner's way turns a comparatively modest spending increase into a whopping one. For that reason, we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10476	"He's promising four more years of an administration that will push for the privatization of Social Security..."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/16/barack-obama/not-the-same-old-bush-plan/	In remarks at the Associated Press annual meeting on April 14, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama took a shot at Sen. John McCain's plans for Social Security. "He's promising four more years of an administration that will push for the privatization of Social Security — a plan that would gamble away people's retirement on the stock market; a plan that was already rejected by Democrats and Republicans under George Bush." The truth is, so far McCain isn't promising much of anything concrete when it comes to Social Security. While on the campaign trail, he has hammered at the need for "straight talk" about a system that is going broke, but he has been short on details about what he would do, except to say that with bipartisan negotiations he thinks he can fix the program's projected bankruptcy in 2041 without raising taxes. McCain's campaign Web site states that McCain supports "supplementing" the current Social Security system with personal investment accounts — "but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept." This approach appears to rule out a plan like the previous Bush plan, which would have diverted some Social Security payroll taxes to fund private investment accounts controlled by individual workers. That's a bit of a change for McCain, who in his presidential bid in 2000 proposed an option for workers to invest at least 20 percent of their Social Security payroll taxes in private accounts. In 2005, McCain stumped alongside President Bush when Bush pitched a plan to let workers born after 1950 to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into personal retirement accounts invested in stocks and bonds. In exchange, workers would have had to accept a cut in the traditional Social Security benefit. This time around, McCain is staying fairly vague about details of his plans. In a Q&A; with the Wall Street Journal , published on March 3, 2008, McCain was asked why he had changed his plan from one that would use some payroll taxes to create Social Security private accounts to one that talks about accounts as "supplements" to Social Security. "Actually," McCain responded, "I'm totally in favor of personal savings accounts and I think they are an important opportunity for young workers." McCain's chief economic aide, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, told the Wall Street Journal in March 2008 that "McCain intends to keep Social Security solvent by reducing the growth in benefits over the coming decades to match projected growth in payroll tax revenues. Among the options are extending the retirement age to 68 and reducing cost-of-living adjustments, but the campaign hasn't made any final decisions yet." John Rother, policy director at AARP, said he, too, has spoken with Holtz-Eakin and understands McCain's plan to be "sort of an in-between system" compared to his earlier efforts. "I think there's a lot of unresolved questions," Rother said. "It's not clear how he plans to fund the 401(k) program or how everyone would take advantage of it. I am hoping Sen. McCain will have a chance to define things better going forward." There's a lot we don't know about how McCain would deal with the financial problems in Social Security, but we know enough to say that Obama's statement that McCain's plan is the same as the Bush plan isn't accurate. Obama's statement suggests that McCain would entirely supplant the Social Security system with private investment accounts, but the Republican's campaign statements so far talk about using private accounts to "supplement" Social Security benefits. For these reasons, we rate Obama's characterization of McCain's plans to reform Social Security as False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-04-16T00:00:00	2008-04-14	['None']
pomt-06393	Says state Senate President Stephen "Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/31/americans-prosperity-new-jersey/conservative-group-claims-steve-sweeney-gave-new-j/	A conservative organization’s ad campaign paints a group of New Jersey Democrats as President Barack Obama’s minions -- and state Senate President Stephen Sweeney is among them. The New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity launched last week a series of radio and television spots targeting incumbent legislators battling for re-election on Nov. 8. An ad criticizing Sweeney claims the South Jersey Democrat’s "Obama-style policies" are responsible for high unemployment in the state. "How? Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs. Sweeney backs cap and trade and raising electric rates, which will drive out more jobs. And Sweeney backs Obama’s job-destroying government health care plan and Obama's failed stimulus schemes," the ad says. High taxes. Fewer jobs. We’ve heard -- and checked -- similar claims before, but never specifically on income tax rates. So, did Sweeney give New Jersey the nation's highest income tax rate, driving jobs out of state? Sweeney took office as a state Senator in 2002. Since then, New Jersey has never had the the highest income tax rate in the nation. The state Legislature increased the top income tax rate in 2004 and 2009. Sweeney voted for both measures, but he’s just one vote among many and the governor signed both bills. In 2004, New Jersey’s top income tax rate went from 6.37 percent on those making more than $75,000 to 8.97 percent on those making more than $500,000 with the so-called "millionaires’ tax." Several other states, including California, Montana and Vermont, all had higher income tax rates that year, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy. In 2009, the state’s top income tax rate increased to 10.75 percent on incomes over $1 million. Even then, Hawaii and Oregon had slightly larger top income tax rates of 11 percent. The tax expired in 2010. Sweeney became the state Senate president the same year. He has tried twice since then to reinstate the "millionaires’ tax," but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed both measures. Steve Lonegan, director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, argued that all taxes, whether they are sales taxes or property taxes, "conspire to be a tax of everyone’s income." But the ad clearly says New Jersey has the "nation's highest income tax rate," while showing a photo of a New Jersey residential income tax form. So, on that point, the ad is wrong. But are New Jersey’s income tax rates responsible for job loss? Lonegan referred to a Tax Foundation study that ranked New Jersey as the worst in the nation for state and local tax burdens. And according to the tax research group, the Garden State ranks number one in that category. But when it comes to the destruction of jobs, taxes may be one factor, but they aren’t the only factor. "Everything matters," said Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. "But taxes also matter." Ronald Alt, senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, said the argument that increasing the top income tax rates discourages people from taking risks and starting businesses "really overstates the effect of the tax rates. There are a lot of other factors that come into play." Those factors, according to Alt, include: the level of education in the state, how close the business is to its market and suppliers, who the business is selling to and the overall cost of doing business in the state. Our ruling The New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity launched an ad campaign targeting Democratic incumbents running for re-election. One television spot said, "Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs." During Sweeney’s tenure the top income tax rate in New Jersey increased twice. Neither of those tax hikes bumped New Jersey into the top spot in the nation for income taxes -- and you can’t solely blame Sweeney for either increase. And the ad’s larger point that high incomes tax rates decreased jobs is overstated. We rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12943	"In 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that’s saying, 'Hey, we should get all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.' "	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/08/cory-booker/booker-mcconnell-full-ethics-review-obama-nominees/	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell advocated for thorough vetting of President Barack Obama’s cabinet nominees, but he seems to have a different standard for President-elect Donald Trump’s, suggested New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker on CBS’ Face the Nation. The Republican-controlled Senate will hold several confirmation hearings for the week of Jan. 10, frustrating Democrats like Booker who say the jam-packed schedule was a move to deflect public attention from Trump’s more controversial nominees. But back "in 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that’s saying, ‘Hey, we should have all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.’ I just was reviewing his letter this morning," Booker said Jan. 8, emphasizing that rigorous review is perhaps more important for Trump’s nominees given their wealth, international business ties and potential conflicts of interest. Is Booker right that McConnell advocated for complete ethical review for Obama’s appointees before holding confirmation hearings? Booker’s claim is accurate, though it may be a bit premature to charge McConnell with hypocrisy. The confirmation process All cabinet-level positions as well as scores of senior-level personnel for executive branch agencies must be confirmed by the Senate. (Those who don’t have to be confirmed are positions that solely advise the president.) First, the president or president-elect selects, vets and submits nominations to the appropriate Senate committees. Then the committees typically hold investigations (using information provided by the White House and their own research) and hearings (for public debate over the nomination). Finally, after review, they report the nominations to the full Senate for a vote on the floor. According to the Congressional Research Service, the clearance stage includes submitting financial disclosure forms, completing background checks and signing ethics agreements that identify and outline ways to mitigate conflicts of interest, reviewed and certified by the Office of Government Ethic. This typically occurs before the nominations are submitted to the Senate. The rules for confirmation vary by committee. All review a nominee’s biographical resume and some set of disclosure forms. Some also consult FBI background checks. Again, this information gathering often happens before a hearing, but is more often required before a vote. In a letter released by Senate Democrats, the director of the independent Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, expressed concern that several of Trump’s nominees with scheduled hearings have yet to complete the ethics review process as of Jan. 6, 2017. "I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review," Shaub wrote. "In fact, OGE has not received even the initial draft financial disclosure reports for some of the nominees scheduled for hearings." Out of the Trump picks with confirmation hearings scheduled, ethics forms have been submitted for attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, defense secretary nominee James Mattis and transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao, according to the Associated Press. It’s unclear if forms have been submitted for CIA director nominee Rep. Mike Pompeo, homeland security secretary nominee Gen. John Kelly, and housing secretary nominee Ben Carson. Forms have not been submitted for education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos or commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. McConnell’s letter Experts agreed with Booker’s characterization of McConnell’s letter, sent to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dated Feb. 12, 2009. "Prior to considering any time agreements on the floor on any nominee," McConnell wrote, ranking members expect eight ethical standards to be met. Among them: a completed FBI background check, a completed Office of Government Ethics letter, completed financial disclosure statements (and tax returns where they apply) and a completed committee questionnaires submitted to the respective Senate committees "prior to a hearing being noticed." In layman’s terms, McConnell not only required for "completion of disclosures but also review prior to floor consideration," said Wayne Steger, a political science professor at DePaul University and the author of A Citizen’s Guide to Presidential Nominations. "The ethics review process had to be complete before he would agree to set aside the right to filibuster nominations," said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis and expert on Senate procedure. Booker’s office also referred us to a 2009 Roll Call article on McConnell’s letter. "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday threatened to filibuster any of President Barack Obama’s executive branch nominations if they do not meet what he deemed a series of ‘standards’ for installment," the article reads (full version here). McConnell’s office, meanwhile, argued that Booker mischaracterized the letter. McConnell’s communications director David Popp pointed out that by the time McConnell sent letter on Feb. 12, the Senate had already held hearings for everyone Obama nominated. This is accurate, and all but one of the 13 nominees was confirmed before Feb. 12. "If you read the letter, it simply calls for continuing the best practices and precedents of the Senate — it does not ask for new preconditions the way Sen. Booker and other Democrats are now doing, such as calling for the tax returns of all nominees, rather than only in those committees that regularly request returns," he said. Appearing right before Booker on Face the Nation, McConnell dismissed concerns from Democrats as sour grapes disguised as "little procedural complaints" and emphasized the need to get Trump’s national security team up and running on day one. He suggested his ethical standards hadn’t changed and said there is still time to comply. After all, "we are still in the process of getting the papers in. I think at least five of the nominees have all of their papers in," he said. "The real thing is the vote on the floor, and we want to have all of the records in, all of the papers completed before they are actually confirmed on the Senate floor." The ruling Booker said, "In 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that’s saying, 'Hey, we should have all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.' " McConnell wrote a letter on Feb. 12, 2009 that advocated for completion of disclosure forms before hearings and as a condition of floor consideration. But most of the the people Obama nominated by the time of McConnell's letter had already been approved. We rate Booker’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-08263	"We're the only system of federalism in the world."	false	/florida/statements/2010/nov/10/pam-bondi/defending-health-care-suit-new-florida-ag-says-uni/	Pam Bondi, Florida's next attorney general, already is delivering on a campaign promise to keep fighting the new federal health care law. Bondi, a Republican elected with almost 55 percent of the vote, appeared on On The Record with Greta Van Susteren on Nov. 9, 2010, to discuss how she was taking over the suit from outgoing Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum. Bondi said she was prepared to argue the case and that she attended the first round of oral arguments in Pensacola. Van Susteren then asked Bondi if she had examined election results across the country to target other states that might now be willing to join the legal challenge. Nineteen states already have signed onto Florida's suit, and Van Susteren wanted to know whether it would matter if a majority of states could be roped in as well. "Well, and it does (matter)," Bondi said. "And I mean, we're the only system of federalism in the world. And I think what this does, if we -- and we are going to have a majority of the states joining in. And I think it's going to vindicate our Constitution and what our Founding Fathers believed that our system should be made of." Bondi went on to say that she hopes the states of Oklahoma, Ohio and Kansas will join the lawsuit, as could Wisconsin, Wyoming, Maine, and maybe even California. "If you look at the whole board game, we could have a total of 28 states joining in this lawsuit," Bondi said. The lawsuit filed in Florida argues that the federal government cannot impose taxes or financial penalties on someone who fails to have health insurance. In this fact check, we're not going to analyze how many states will join the challenge to the health care law. Instead, we want to examine Bondi's statement that the United States is the only country in the world with a federalist system -- a system where sovereignty is constitutionally split between at least two levels of government. And, put another way, where states can have greater power than the national government. The basic principle of federalism originates in the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1791, which says: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." James Madison helped explain the delegation of powers between the states and the federal government in The Federalist Papers. "The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government, are few and defined," Madison wrote in 1788 in The Federalist No. 45 under the pseudonym Publius. "Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite." Is the United States the only country in the world where the power to govern is shared between a central government and provinces or states? Hardly, experts we talked to said. "Our neighbors Canada and Mexico would find this declaration rather surprising, given that both systems are federal systems of government, with states or provinces sharing specific and separate authority over different areas of policy," said Christopher Reenock, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at Florida State University. Reenock pointed to at least 19 other countries that have a federalist form of government, including Germany, Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Russia, Brazil, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. "Given that there are around 195 countries in the world, it is certainly true that federalist systems are in the minority, comprising only about 10 percent of those countries," Reenock said. "But one would have to stretch (the) data quite a bit to declare that the U.S. is the only system of federalism in the world." Carl Steiren, an expert with the Forum of Federations, said that his organization considers 25 countries around the world to have a federalist system, and that nearly 40 percent of the world's population lives in a federal country. You can see the list here. Steiren described the Forum of Federations, which is based in Canada, as an international organization that brings together people from different federal countries to share best practices and horror stories, in order to emulate the former and avoid the latter. Its board of directors includes policy makers and diplomats from Canada, Europe and Africa. "Pam Bondi is not correct in saying 'We're the only system of federalism in the world,' unless she qualifies it by adding something else, such as 'that has 50 states,' " Steiren said. Steiren said the United States is widely considered to have created the first federal system, but it's far from the only. Switzerland, for instance, decentralizes many of the functions of government among its 26 cantons. And Australia copied much of its federal system from the United States. "We must not lose sight of the essential condition that this is to be a federation of States and not a single government," said Australian founding father Samuel Griffith in 1891. Sounds a bit like Madison, huh? Griffith continued: "The separate States are to continue as autonomous bodies, surrendering only so much of their power as is necessary to the establishment of a general government to do for them collectively what they cannot do individually for themselves, and which they cannot do as a collective body for themselves." We reached out to Bondi, who acknowledged the mistake. "Pam intended to say that we have the 'oldest' system of federalism, not that ours is the 'only' one," said Carlos Muniz, the executive director of Bondi's transition team. "For her, the relevance of this point is that federalism -- the U.S. Constitution's clear delineation of powers between the federal and state governments -- has always been a fundamental aspect of our Constitution and of our national heritage. Completely apart from any policy-based disagreements with the federal healthcare law, Pam is committed to Florida's lawsuit precisely because she sees it as necessary to preserve our federalist system of government." Appearing on Fox News, Bondi got off track in discussing a legal challenge to the federal health care law by saying the United States has the "only system of federalism in the world." The United States may have been the first, but it's far from the only. We rate this statement False.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2010-11-10T15:56:39	2010-11-09	['None']
pomt-13298	Says a tweet he sent out "wasn’t saying, ‘check out a sex tape.’ It was just ‘take a look at" the background of Alicia Machado.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/trump-early-morning-sex-tape-tweet/	During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump took issue with moderator Anderson Cooper’s description of an early morning tweet he had sent out about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Machado emerged up as an issue in the campaign during the first debate, when Hillary Clinton cited Machado’s allegations that Trump had called the Venezuela-born contestant "Miss Piggy" and "Miss Housekeeping" after she’d gained weight as Miss Universe. At the time, Trump was part-owner of the pageant. The next morning, Trump criticized Machado during a Fox and Friends interview. And Trump eventually brought the feud to Twitter. In the second debate on Oct. 9, Cooper cited the tweet in a question about whether Trump has the right temperament to be president. "In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape," Cooper said. "Is that the discipline of a good president?" Trump responded, "No, it wasn’t saying, ‘check out a sex tape.’ It was just ‘take a look at the person she built up to be this wonderful girl scout, who was no girl scout.’ " Maybe that’s what Trump wanted people to read into it. But he did, in fact, direct his followers to check out a sex tape. In the tweet -- sent at 5:30 a.m. ET on Sept. 30 -- Trump wrote, "Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?" (For the record, no one has turned up a sex tape.) Our ruling Trump said the tweet he sent out "wasn’t saying, ‘check out a sex tape’" but rather to "just take a look at" Machado’s background. That’s ridiculous. While Trump did urge his Twitter followers to check out Machado’s "past," he literally wrote "check out sex tape" in the tweet.

pomt-01168	Mike "Martinez has voted to raise taxes and utility rates while ending free bus service for seniors."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/dec/11/steve-adler/steve-adler-mike-martinez-tax-utility-rates-fares/	Austin voters should doubt mayoral aspirant Mike Martinez’s commitment to an affordable city, his opponent in a Dec. 16, 2014, runoff maintains. The narrator of a Steve Adler TV ad says that as an Austin City Council member, Mike Martinez "has voted to raise taxes and utility rates while ending free bus service for seniors." That statement is made against this visual backdrop: Source: TV ad from Steve Adler, Austin mayoral candidate, "Mike Martinez Record on City Council," posted online Dec. 2, 2014. Martinez has been a council member since June 2006. So it’s no surprise he would have had a say on taxes and rates charged by the city-owned utilities, though unsaid here is that no single council member controls any such decisions; it’s been a seven-member body, including the mayor. Martinez also chairs the eight-person board overseeing Capital Metro, which provides local bus and limited rail service. So he could have voted on fares charged the elderly. Let’s recap Martinez’s actions on fares, city taxes and utility rates. Bus fares To our inquiries, Adler’s campaign didn’t provide comprehensive backup for his ad claim. But by email, spokesman Jim Wick pointed out a September 2010 Austin American-Statesman news story stating the Cap Metro board voted to require bus riders 65 and older to pay 50 cents a ride or $15 for a 31-day bus pass, starting in 2011. The story also said the board was deciding to charge seniors and people with disabilities to ride buses for the first time since 1989. For Capital Metro, spokeswoman Francine Pares told us by email Martinez has been a board member since June 2007 and chairman since January 2010. Pares also confirmed the board’s decision to charge the 50-cent fares, though she said that change was adopted at the board’s November 2010 gathering, which Martinez didn’t attend, she said. According to minutes of the Nov. 10, 2010, board meeting, the six members who were there unanimously approved a resolution authorizing higher fares in part, the resolution said, to generate additional operating revenues "while striving to meet growing demand for transportation options." Martinez and another board member were recorded as absent. Pares told us the board in September 2013 approved another increase in senior fares, to 60 cents, effective in 2015. Generally, she said, senior citizens receive 50 percent off regular fares. By phone, Martinez agreed he and fellow board members agreed to charge the fares for elderly residents. But that happened, he said, only after a state panel issued "marching orders" including a recommendation calling for Capital Metro to raise more money from fares. In a 2010 report, the staff of the Sunset Advisory Commission recommended the authority charge a bus fare of 50 cents for groups currently riding free. The commission had said 30 percent of Capital Metro’s passengers were riding for free and, it noted, the board had rejected proposed fares in 2008 and 2009. In its final July 2011 report on Capital Metro, the commission said: "While fare increases are difficult, requiring only a portion of its ridership to bear the burden of these increases is not equitable or sustainable, especially in bad financial times." Martinez pointed out the sunset review occurred in keeping with legislation passed into law by the 2009 Legislature, which wanted Capital Metro to get its finances in order. City taxes On taxes, Wick of Adler’s camp offered as backup news stories indicating that in 2009, Martinez said taxpayers would have to pay "a little more" in taxes and fees through 2010 to maintain services and in 2010, the council acting to raise the city’s property tax rate from 42.09 cents per $100 of property value to 45.71 cents; the city tax on a median value home was expected to increase $52 to $843. Wick followed up by emailing us a chart made by Adler’s campaign indicating city property taxes on a median-valued home going up on Martinez’s watch. For a non-campaign analysis, we turned to the Travis Central Appraisal District; the chief appraiser, Marya Crigler, emailed us a chart indicating city property taxes on a median-value homestead in 2007 were $715; in 2014, the comparable figure was $1,014. We converted the 2007 figure to 2014 dollars, using a federal inflation calculator. Upshot: Adjusted for inflation, city taxes on a median-value Austin homestead went up $278, or 34 percent, from 2007 through 2014, Martinez’s council years. Over those years, according to the district, the median taxable value of an Austin homestead went from $177,257 to $228,032. Adjusting for inflation suggests there was a nearly $18,800, 9 percent, increase. Martinez agreed property owners paid more in taxes in his council tenure, results influenced by surging property values, he said. Still, he said, in five of eight years, council members voted to keep the city’s property tax rate the same or to lower it. When the rate was raised, he said, the economy was in recession. For another fact check, the city provided this chart of tax rates, which shows the council raised the rate three times in Martinez’s tenure, most recently for 2013, but cut the rate four times, most recently for 2014. In September 2014, the council left the 2014 rate intact for 2015. Utility rates In 2011, we found Mostly True a claim that Austin Energy, the city electric utility, was considering its first hike in rates since 1994. The base electric rate, covering staff, the electric system, power plants, vehicles and the like, hadn’t changed since 1994. Meantime, residential customers were paying less for electricity than they once had, taking inflation into account. On June 7, 2012, the council unanimously voted to raise the base rate, the American-Statesman reported. The news story said: "The complicated new rate structure will hit customers in different ways; generally speaking, the larger and more energy-hungry the home, the higher the percentage increase," effective October 2012. "A typical home, which uses an average of 1,000 kilowatt-hours a month over the course of a year, will see its monthly bill rise by $8, to $113, according to Austin Energy calculations. A home that uses a lot of electricity would see its monthly bill increase by $59, to $332," the story said. How would Adler have voted? We asked Wick how Adler would have voted on the bus fares, tax and utility rate hikes we confirmed. There’s no simple answer, Wick said by email, but Adler favors free fares for senior citizens. Our ruling Mike "Martinez has voted to raise taxes and utility rates while ending free bus service for seniors." Austin residents pay more in taxes and could be paying more for electricity thanks to council actions Martinez supported. He also backed a decision by the Capital Metro board to charge half fares to elderly bus riders who had previously not been charged, though Martinez hardly did this by himself; it’s worth clarifying, too, that Capital Metro was under pressure to improve its finances and that Martinez missed the vote creating the then-50-cent fare.

pomt-09552	"Thomas Jefferson created the Marines for the Islamic pirates that were happening."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/03/glenn-beck/beck-claims-marines-were-created-thomas-jefferson-/	On his Fox News program on Jan. 29, 2010, Glenn Beck was providing a history lesson on progressives in U.S. politics when he made the point that the difference between progressives and the Founding Fathers is that the founders thought the United States "should be Switzerland. We should stay out of everybody's business, be friends with everybody." "I mean, if you're going to mess with us, we're going to pound you," Beck said. "Thomas Jefferson created the Marines for the Islamic pirates that were happening, right?" One of the panelists on the show agreed with him, and Beck continued: "And so they didn't take any guff. But they weren't spreading democracy. Progressives spread democracy and gooey goodness." We wondered, was the U.S. Marines Corps really created by Jefferson to combat the Islamic terrorists of yesteryear? Our first call was to Charles P. Neimeyer, director of the History Division, U.S. Marine Corps in Quantico, Va. The Marine Corps annually marks its birthday on Nov. 10, to commemorate the day in 1775 that the Continental Congress formally adopted a resolution founding the Continental Marines, Neimeyer said. During the Revolutionary War, Marines fought with distinction. On March 3, 1776, 200 Marines spearheaded the first American landing on foreign soil, an assault in the Bahamas. So that's why, if you go the Marine Corps' History Web site, you'll see the banner, "Since 1775, the Marine Corps has been winning battles and defending our nation." Obviously, that predates Thomas Jefferson's presidency. It also happens to predate the United States of America. After the Revolutionary War, the Navy and Marines disbanded. The country essentially did without a Navy (and Marines) until the Naval Act of 1794, which called for the construction of six frigates, which were to include a force of Marines. Why was the Navy re-established? A couple reasons. According to Marine Corps scholars, one of the principal reasons was that Barbary "corsairs" were harassing and attacking American ships doing trade at Mediterranean ports. The corsairs were essentially North African pirates, and they were Muslims. The Washington Post wrote an interesting story about some of the historical parallels between then and now. So Beck is correct about that. But Beck is wrong on one important detail. The Marines weren't created by Jefferson. And as it turned out, the conflict with Barbary pirates wasn't the impetus behind finally getting the Marine Corps established. A temporary lull in the Barbary conflict delayed implementation of the Naval Act. But in 1797, a new conflict arose on the high seas -- with France. Tensions with France rose during the naval war between France and Britain, with France interfering with a number of American merchant ships. And on July 11, 1798, President John Adams (not Jefferson) signed legislation formally creating the U.S. Marine Corps to help deal with the French. And, in fact, the Marine Corps did participate prominently in the short-lived undeclared "Quasi-War" with France. After the fighting with France, the conflict with Barbary pirates flared up again. Under Jefferson, the Marine Corps was employed in numerous operations against the pirates and the north African countries that sponsored them. Famously, Marines led an overland assault and captured the city of Derna in Tripoli in 1805 (hence the line in the Marines' Hymn, "the shores of Tripoli"). We think the spirit of Beck's claim is largely accurate, that the threat of Barbary corsairs -- or as Beck accurately calls them, Islamic pirates -- inspired Congress to move toward re-establishing a Marine Corps. It turned out that a conflict with France actually kicked that proposal into gear, and Beck named the wrong president (though he was only off by one administration). And so we give his statement a Half True.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2010-02-03T18:21:32	2010-01-29	['Islam']
pomt-07060	"The top 1 percent of income earners pay 40 percent of all state income taxes, and those at the bottom pay little or nothing."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/29/michael-doherty/sen-mike-doherty-says-minority-new-jersey-income-e/	It’s a statistic long touted in New Jersey to demonstrate the tax-paying discrepancy among residents: A very small percentage of New Jersey’s top income earners pay about 40 percent of New Jersey’s income taxes. In recent months the statistic has been cited in arguments about whether to reinstate the so-called millionaire’s tax, and state Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) mentioned it in a May 24 guest editorial in The Star-Ledger. In explaining New Jersey’s progressive income tax, Doherty described how he wants an equal amount of money spent on educating every New Jersey child, regardless of need. HIs column came in the wake of a state Supreme Court ruling that New Jersey must give an additional $500 million to the state’s 31 low-income – or Abbott – districts. "In 1976, New Jersey instituted a state income tax to provide sufficient funding for our public schools," Doherty wrote. "After the income tax is collected, it is distributed to towns as school aid. New Jersey’s income tax rate is very progressive. The top 1 percent of income earners pay 40 percent of all state income taxes, and those at the bottom pay little or nothing." Doherty added in his column that New Jersey’s progressive tax structure accounts for economic differences among residents: those who earn more pay more, those who earn less pay less – one reason why those at the lower end of the income scale aren’t paying as much in income taxes. PolitiFact New Jersey checked the statistic and found Doherty’s claim to be true. Andy Pratt, a state Treasury Department spokesman, confirmed Doherty’s math for us. "The senator’s statement is indeed accurate," Pratt said in a June 2 email. "In some years the number is a little higher than 40 percent, in others a bit lower. But historically, it’s been around 40 percent." Pratt pointed to 2009 as a good example of Doherty’s statistic. "The total take from the gross income tax was $9.135 billion," Pratt wrote. "The take from the top 1 percent of filers (both resident and non-resident) was $3.715 billion or about 40.7 percent. Note that, historically, half of the top 1 percent make more than a million (dollars)." Steve Lonegan, state director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans For Prosperity, which leans conservative, also backs up Doherty’s numbers. He blasts the state’s progressive income tax structure as making New Jersey bad for business and a reason why the state has highest tax burden in the country. "It’s worse than not a good thing," Lonegan said of the state’s progressive tax structure. "It’s a destructive thing. It’s based on the whole concept of the people who have the votes can take from those who can’t." A flat, or flatter tax in New Jersey, would improve the economic scales for all, said Lonegan, also a former mayor of Bogota in Bergen County. Mark Robyn, an economist with the pro-business Tax Foundation in Washington, DC, told PolitiFact New Jersey that there are other states that have even higher progressive tax rate structures than New Jersey: Hawaii, California and Oregon, among them. "There are states with higher marginal tax rates, but whether that relates to a greater reliance on the top 1 percent (of income earners), it’s hard to say," Robyn told us. Robyn also noted that New Jersey ranks number one in total state and local tax burden by percentage of income for 2009, the most recent year that data is available. Returning to Doherty’s statement, let’s review. The senator said the top 1 percent of income earners in New Jersey pay 40 percent of all state income taxes and those at the bottom pay little or nothing. The state Treasury Department and two conservative-leaning organizations back up that claim, noting that the Garden State’s progressive income tax structure accounts for economic differences among residents by requiring those who earn more to pay more. A liberal-leaning organization notes that looking at all taxes, not just income tax, would show the impact of New Jersey’s tax structure on its residents. We rate Doherty’s statement True.

pomt-15055	On the main GOP presidential debate: "Not one candidate on the debate stage has military experience … "	true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/28/jim-gilmore/gilmore-says-gop-prime-time-presidential-debators-/	Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore was not in a charitable mood Sept. 16 when he watched from afar as his 15 major rivals for the Republican presidential nomination debated on CNN. Gilmore was excluded because his polling numbers did not meet the 1 percent threshold for participation. He viewed the action from his campaign office in Alexandria -- first, the 90-minute "undercard" debate between the bottom four candidates, and then the three-hour main event among the top 11 that drew about 22.9 million viewers. Gilmore live-tweeted through it all, accusing his colleagues of misunderstanding issues, ducking questions and exhibiting facial expressions that were unpresidential. And then, there was this tweet, made during the 11-candidate debate: "Not one candidate on the stage has military experience, and it shows," Gilmore wrote. We decided to check whether any of the prime-time debaters ever wore the uniform. Gilmore, it should be noted, has served in the military. Faced with a low draft number when he graduated from the University of Virginia in 1971, he enlisted in the Army for three years and served in the intelligence corps at NATO headquarters in Germany -- an experience he usually mentions in citing his qualifications for the White House. He rose to the rank of sergeant. As for the 11 debaters, we pored through biographies on their campaign websites and a variety of other authoritative sources for their resumes and backgrounds. No evidence of military service turned up for any of them. Three were old enough to be drafted during the Vietnam War -- Donald Trump, Ben Carson and John Kasich -- but managed to avoid conscription during an era when many college students received deferments from military service and draft numbers were determined by lottery drawings of birth dates. The draft effectively ended in December 1972, and the U.S. shifted to an all-volunteer military, but none of the candidates claims to have stepped forward either in the active military or the reserves. Participating in the main debate -- in addition to three candidates mentioned above -- were Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker (who since has dropped out of the race). The B Team What about the four Republicans who participated in the undercard debate? Although they were not included in Gilmore’s statement, we thought it would be interesting also to look at their records. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., served as an Air Force prosecutor from 1982 to 1988 and then spent 27 years as a reservist, first in the South Carolina Air National Guard and then transferring to the Air Reserve. Graham, who was not deployed for combat, retired as a colonel in June. His three debate partners -- Bobby Jindal, George Pataki and Rick Santorum -- list no military service in their resumes. The Democrats While we’re on the subject, let’s look at the military records of the five most prominent Democratic candidates. Nothing is listed for four of them: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley and Lincoln Chafee. Former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia served in the Marine Corps from 1969 to 1972, including a 13-month stint as a rifle platoon and company commander in Vietnam. Webb, a recipient of the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts, achieved the rank of captain. Our ruling While watching the main GOP presidential debate, Gilmore tweeted, "Not one candidate on the stage has military experience … " We rate his statement True.

pomt-14926	"In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/oct/30/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-florida-has-cheapest-public-college-/	During a discussion about student debt at the CNBC Republican presidential debate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich talked about bringing down college costs, prompting Jeb Bush to chime in about the low cost of tuition in Florida. "We don't need the federal government to be involved in this, because when they do, we create a $1.2 trillion debt," said the former Florida governor during the Oct. 28 debate in Boulder, Colo. "In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John (Kasich) said. You'll create a much better graduation rate at a lower cost, and you won't indebt the next generation with recourse debt on their backs." We wanted to know: Does Florida hold the No. 1 spot for lowest in-state college tuition? Comparison of in-state tuition Bush spokesman Matt Gorman said that when Bush left office in 2007, Florida had the lowest in-state tuition for a public four-year university among the 50 states. The data from the College Board bears that out: It was $3,881 for a four-year public university in 2006-07. But during the debate, Bush didn’t say he was referring to when he ended his tenure as governor — he made it sound like he was talking in the present tense, so we looked at that data, too. The College Board publishes an annual comparison of in-state tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide, comprised of survey data from almost 4,000 postsecondary institutions. The comparison refers to average price paid by a full-time student for one year of undergraduate enrollment. For 2014-15, the lowest was Wyoming at $4,646, followed by Arkansas at $6,138; Utah at $6,177; New Mexico at $6,190; Montana at $6,279, and then Florida at $6,351. So Florida was the sixth-lowest, although four of the states were only between $72 and $213 cheaper than Florida. "Florida is one of the most affordable states for public university tuition," said Ralph Aiello, who supervises college counselors for Broward County public schools in Florida. The College Board produces a similar report comparing tuition for two-year degrees which showed that Florida was again on the low end but not at the cheapest spot in 2014-15. "There are a number of reasons for the wide variation in published tuition and fees by state — state tuition philosophy, aid policy, economic conditions, and funding for higher education," said Jennifer Ma, the College Board’s policy research scientist. "For example, New Hampshire, which has the highest published tuition and fees for the public four-year sector in 2014-15, does not have a state grant aid program and has the lowest state appropriations on a per-student basis." Bush specifically mentioned "tuition," but we’ll note that there are a lot of factors than influence the ultimate price tag for students, including fees, scholarships, financial aid and room and board. Our ruling Bush said, "In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state." That’s not accurate if we look at 2014-15 tuition for four-year public universities compiled by the College Board. That data shows Wyoming had the lowest tuition followed by Arkansas, Utah, New Mexico, Montana and Florida. Florida was the sixth-lowest. Bush’s campaign said he was referring to Florida’s ranking as the lowest in 2006-07 when he left office, but he didn’t specify that timeframe during the debate. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-02397	Every child in Colorado who has been given medical marijuana for treatment for seizures has had diminished seizure activity.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/11/allen-peake/lawmaker-studies-show-medical-marijuana-reduces-se/	An important debate is ongoing in the Georgia Legislature concerning the use of a form of medical marijuana to treat certain forms of seizures. The state’s House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed House Bill 885, which would allow for the use of medical research cannabis in specific cases. The bill’s supporters are anxiously hoping the Georgia Senate will adopt the legislation. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s new Legislative Navigator gives it a 27 percent chance of passing this session. The bill’s primary sponsor, Rep. Allen Peake, R-Macon, offered what appeared to be a persuasive argument to support the legislation. "(In Colorado), 100 percent of children have seen diminished seizure activity," Peake told fellow House members in the discussion before the bill was passed. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Peake’s statement was correct. Peake and other leading House Republicans did not plan to advocate this session on legislation that involves medical marijuana, particularly in an election year. Peake said he was persuaded to get involved after meeting a 4-year-old girl from his area named Haleigh Cox who suffers from a severe seizure disorder. Peake said he received the information he used to base his claim from the Realm of Caring, a Colorado-based organization that has attempted to provide care to patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, Parkinson’s disease and other conditions through the use of medicinal cannabis oil. Some Georgians have moved to Colorado to seek treatment for their children. Peake clarified his statement, saying that it was actually 98 percent of patients who had diminished seizure activity. Marijuana contains about 60 chemical components called cannabinoids. The cannabinoid that the bill’s proponents are considering is cannabidiol. It would be ingested and not smoked, the bill’s supporters say. It would not include THC, which is the element in cannabis that causes smokers to get high. The form of cannabidiol used at the Realm of Caring is named Charlotte’s Web, after a 5-year-old girl whose recovery from a rare condition is credited to the substance. Charlotte’s Web is a rich amber and as thick as cold honey. It smells like marijuana and tastes like raw plants. A month’s supply of the oil can cost $150 to $250, and some families say they receive financial help from nonprofit groups. Heather Jackson, the executive director of the Realm of Caring Foundation, said Peake was correct that every patient studied in the first set of tests, "harvests" is the term she used, had a reduction in seizures. The Realm of Caring is in its second harvest and has seen less than a handful of nonresponders, which accounts for Peake’s revised 98 percent total. The New York Times, though, reported in December that there is "scattered medical research" to substantiate claims cannabis oils helped reduce seizures, citing a 2012 study on the American Epilepsy Society’s website. Other researchers have also cautioned there is not enough research on its medicinal benefits. The American Epilepsy Society wants "well-controlled studies" it believes will lead to a better understanding of the effectiveness of cannabidiol and other forms of medical marijuana on epilepsy patients. Amy Brooks-Kayal, a Colorado-based neurology physician who is first vice president of the American Epilepsy Society, said there’s not enough information to determine what the dosage should be or how it interacts with other medicines. The AES, which claims about 3,500 members, said although cannabidiol offers hope, these are only anecdotal reports. Robust scientific evidence for the use of marijuana, it said, is lacking. "There haven’t been good studies with cannabidiol with children with epilepsy," Brooks-Kayal said. The federal Food and Drug Administration has authorized trials of an established British drug, Epidolex, that comes from marijuana. Some experts who believe Epidolex is a better option say it’s unclear whether Charlotte’s Web is free of potentially harmful impurities. Jackson offered us two studies in defense of the treatment. In one study, all 11 children studied showed a reduction in weekly motor-type seizures, the study concluded. After three months, five of the 11 children were seizure-free, the study found. The paper, introduced at the American Epilepsy Society’s annual meeting in December, acknowledged the sample size was small. In the other study, two Stanford University researchers asked parents whose children were using cannabidiol to fill out a survey detailing its impact on their children. Sixteen of the 19 parents reported reduced seizure frequency. Three parents said their children were free of seizures. The most often reported side effects were better mood, increased alertness, better sleep and drowsiness. Common side effects with other forms of treatment were not found, the parents said. Jackson said 13 of those 19 parents had children who were using Charlotte’s Web. Jackson said they are doing more research. Jackson, whose son has used the treatment, said in the cases in which Charlotte’s Web did not result in fewer seizures for the patient, "there is less than a 1 percent chance that a child in this intractable epilepsy population will find one that will work." Charlotte’s Web, she said, has performed better than other forms of treatment. "There is not a treatment in the world that will work for all," Jackson told us. "However, it is important to note that there is not a pharmaceutical in the world that works for even 5 percent of the epilepsy population. So the numbers are quite staggering actually." Peake said he was not deterred by questions or concerns about the research. "The anecdotal evidence is so strong that a parent, in conjunction with their doctor, should have the personal choice to make that decision," Peake said. To sum up, Peake said "every child in Colorado" who has been given medical marijuana for treatment for seizures has had diminished seizure activity. Peake then said it’s actually 98 percent, citing newer data. There are very few studies out there. They do show medical marijuana has a positive impact on seizure activity. But not at the levels Peake said. His statement is partially accurate. But it needs a lot of context to be fully understood. We rate it Half True.

pomt-13187	"Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/25/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-exaggerates-saying-donald-trump-pl/	Donald Trump may be the highest-profile tweeter in political history, but Hillary Clinton isn’t averse to attacking her opponent via Twitter, either. On Oct. 23, Clinton's campaign account tweeted, "Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people. How do you even begin to quantify that?" Attached to the tweet was a short video that offered a comparison of how many sports stadiums would be needed to accommodate 16 million people. (Spoiler alert: It’s larger than the number of pro sports stadiums in the United States -- by a lot.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But how accurate is Clinton’s statement that Trump "says he'd deport 16 million people"? That’s less clear. For starters, we’ll note that Trump has not used the 16 million figure himself in referring to the number of deportations he would oversee as president. Indeed, the Trump campaign tells PolitiFact that they consider the 16 million number to be incorrect. "Mr. Trump’s plan does not call for deporting 16 million," said Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. "It says we will deal with those who are not priorities at a later date." So where does it come from? We’ve looked at this issue in an earlier fact-check of a statement by Tim Kaine. The 16 million tally includes two groups of people: those who are in the country illegally (about 11 million) and the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents (about 4.5 million, according to Pew Research Center). Combined, that’s not quite 16 million, but it’s reasonably close. However, even Trump in recent months has backed away from policies that would make the 11 million figure accurate -- and the evidence for the additional 4.5 million figure is in question, too. Let’s take a closer look. The 11 million figure Complicating this fact-check is that Trump has not been consistent on immigration throughout his campaign. Leading up to the primaries, Trump said he wanted undocumented families to stay together, but "they have to go." In a September 2015 interview on 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Trump what he would do with 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally. "If they've done well, they're going out, and they're coming back in legally ... We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way," Trump said. In November 2015, a day after one of the Republican primary debates, Joe Scarborough of MSNBC asked Trump, "How do you deport 12 million illegal immigrants?" "You do it. You do it. Because they're here illegally, you do it," Trump responded. In that same interview, he said, "you’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely." All of this suggests that Trump did want to deport 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. But that was the old version of Trump’s plan. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Trump refined his immigration plan a year later, in a major speech on Aug. 31 in Arizona. In that 10-point speech, he reiterated get tough measures, but he also suggested not everyone would be deported. Trump started by talking about criminals, saying there would be "zero tolerance for criminal aliens." He said his administration would begin moving them out "Day One," working especially with police and law enforcement who "know who these people are." His fifth point centered on the enforcement of all immigration laws. The Clinton campaign highlighted this part of the speech to back up Clinton’s debate comments. "In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced ... As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country." But Trump also gave another mixed message within the same speech. He said that after accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, after building a wall, ending illegal immigration and establishing a new lawful immigration system, "then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain." That suggests that while every undocumented person could potentially be deported ("subject to deportation"), they won’t all be deported. Put it all together and you have evidence from a year ago that Trump would deport the estimated 11 million people who are in the United States illegally, but less support for that conclusion in his more recent comments. That’s a problem for Clinton’s tweet, which said that Trump "says" -- present tense -- that "he'd deport 16 million people" The 4.5 million figure It’s only possible to get near 16 million if you include the deportation of people who were born in the United States to parents who were in the country illegally. What has Trump said about that? Some background: The 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship says "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." That clause of the amendment is widely understood to mean that everyone born on U.S. soil is automatically an American citizen, despite parents’ immigration status. Trump hasn’t talked about birthright citizenship and "anchor babies" much since the heyday of the GOP primary. In November 2015, Trump said a constitutional amendment would not be needed to deal with the citizenship of children born in the United States to undocumented parents. "You need an act of Congress. You don't have to go through a new amendment or anything, a new constitutional amendment," Trump said November 2015 in an MSNBC interview. "But anchor babies. A woman is pregnant; she goes over to the border, has a baby on our land, now we take care of the baby for the next 85 years." Trump also said several times in 2015 that he does not think citizenship should have been granted to people with undocumented parents. The Clinton campaign points to an August 2015 exchange between Trump and host Bill O'Reilly, who asked, "Illegal immigrant mother and father living in Los Angeles, two children who are American citizens, born here. If you're president do you order authorities to take that family into custody?" Trump answered, "We have no choice. I'm sorry, Bill. We have to bring them out." Trump's responses to similar questions were also vague. In another August 2015 interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, he said undocumented parents would have to leave and unless they were "bad" parents they would take their baby with citizenship with them. And in a town hall with Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Aug. 25, 2016, Trump was asked, "No birthright citizenship, correct?" Trump replied, "Right." Trump’s campaign has not clarified his current position on birthright citizenship. His call for an end to birthright citizenship is no longer prominently featured in the immigration reform section of Trump’s campaign website. But even if it were accurate to say that Trump supports a change in birthright citizenship -- something he has not been consistent about -- he would still need to to strip citizenship from those who already have it, and then deport them. And that would invite even more legal challenges than trying to remove or alter the 14th Amendment. "Such a retroactive statute would clearly be far more controversial than merely changing the rules prospectively," David A. Martin, an immigration, constitutional law and international law scholar and professor emeritus at the University of Virginia School of Law, previously told PolitiFact. So, getting to 16 million requires believing that, first, Trump supports revoking birthright citizenship for those who already have it; second, that he could enact it despite substantial constitutional hurdles; and third, that he would then proceed to deport all 4.5 people who fall into that category. That’s a lot of what-ifs. Our ruling Clinton tweeted, "Donald Trump says he'd deport 16 million people." While Trump has certainly offered his share of hard-line stances on immigration, Clinton’s comment exaggerates his position in several ways. First, Trump didn’t use the 16 million figure himself. Second, while Clinton phrases her tweet in the present tense, her case is weaker now than it would have been a year ago, based on what Trump has said and posted on his website in recent months. Finally, counting the last 4.5 million people needed to get within shouting distance of Clinton’s 16 million figure requires an unlikely cascade of events that Trump’s campaign today says he isn’t seeking to set off.

pomt-11403	Says Michael Screnock "let a child predator walk without time and let a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight-month sentence."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/23/rebecca-dallet/rebecca-dallet-says-michael-screnock-imposed-8-mon/	Less than two weeks before the April 3, 2018, election for Wisconsin Supreme Court, the candidate backed by liberals attacked the candidate backed by conservatives in something of an unexpected way: As being lenient in two sex crime cases. Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet made the attack against Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock in a TV ad released March 19, 2018. Dallet alleges in the ad that Screnock "let a child predator walk without time and let a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight-month sentence." Let’s review both cases. Child predator claim The first case referenced in the ad involves Axel R. Conrad of Wisconsin Dells. He was charged in February 2015 with felony repeated sexual assault of the same child, according to online court records. The incidents occurred over roughly a two-year period starting when Conrad was 17 and the victim was 14. Conrad pleaded no contest to the charge and Screnock sentenced him to five years of probation. In a written statement, the girl told Screnock before the sentencing that she agreed with the probation sentence and said: "I knew what I was doing. I was a willing participant." An important point to note is that the prosecutor and the defense attorney agreed with the probation recommendation of the probation department, although judges are not bound by such recommendations. We’ll also note that the use of the "predator" in the ad can be understood as an older person preying on a younger person, but this was not a case involving a violent sex offender, according to state law. So, it’s correct to say Screnock didn’t sentence Conrad to any "time" -- as in, time behind bars -- though Conrad was put on probation. Rapist claim The other case involved Aldo Eder Ruiz-Velazquez of Sauk City. He was initially charged in March 2016 with third-degree sexual assault, a felony that carries a maximum prison term of 10 years; and with sex with a child age 16 or older, a misdemeanor, according to online court records. In a plea bargain, Ruiz-Velazquez, who was 24 at the time he was charged, pleaded no contest to fourth-degree sexual assault of a child, a misdemeanor, according to online court records. That charge is defined as having sexual contact with a person without the consent of that person. Screnock sentenced Ruiz-Velazquez to two years of probation, including eight months in jail, nearly the maximum time of nine months in jail allowed on the reduced charge. According to a Baraboo News-Republic news article, two underage females said Ruiz-Velazquez bought alcohol for them and took them to a house where they drank together. One of the girls, who was 16, told police that when she went to the bathroom, Ruiz-Velazquez followed her inside and locked the door and had sex with her, even though she repeatedly told him no. The article said the prosecutor agreed to reduce the felony to the misdemeanor in exchange for Ruiz-Velazquez pleading no contest to that charge. The prosecutor and the defense attorney recommended the sentence that Screnock ultimately imposed, the article said. It was unclear whether the victim would have been willing to testify in a trial. According to the news article, the prosecutor said the sentence balanced the victim’s wishes with the needs of society. Screnock, the article said, said that while the charge was serious, the need to protect the public was minimal because Ruiz-Velazquez did not have a history of prior criminal activity. So, the sentence in this case was eight months, but that was nearly the maximum allowed by law under the plea bargain that had been made. Our rating Dallet says Screnock "let a child predator walk without time and let a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight-month sentence." In the first case, an older male teen repeatedly had sex with a younger female teen, who told authorities the relationship was consensual. He was sentenced to five years of probation, but no time behind bars. In the second case, a 16-year-old said a 24-year-old man forced her to have intercourse and he was sentenced two years of probation, including eight months in jail, after pleading no contest to a reduced sexual assault charge. The maximum possible jail sentence for the misdemeanor, the result of a plea bargain, was nine months. We rate Dallet’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-04538	Says it will cost $220 per square foot in hard construction costs to rebuild Portland Public high schools.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/29/our-portland-our-schools/what-estimated-square-foot-cost-rebuild-portland-h/	In May 2011, Portland voters narrowly rejected a $548 million construction bond measure for Portland Public Schools. Voters said they felt shut out of the process; they wanted more say and oversight. Also, a news analysis by The Oregonian at the time reported that the school rebuilds would be among the costliest in Oregon. The analysis showed the district had budgeted $325 a square foot to renovate six urban schools. The school board tried again. This time, members said they had heard the people’s cry for greater transparency and fiscal diligence. So they put a $482 million bond measureon the November ballot. The overall size is smaller, at $1.10 a year for every $1,000 of assessed property value for the early years, versus $2 in 2011. This bond will pay to modernize three high schools and build one K-8 school, plus improve science classrooms and add seismic and roof upgrades at dozens more. School construction costs are $278 million of the $482 million, for four schools; last time costs were about $330 million of $548 million, for nine schools. In an attempt to assure voters that the district is on the up and up, supporters of Measure 26-144 have posted on their website the answers to two questions that every voter wants to know. How much will this measure cost me? And how do I know the district will spend my money wisely to rebuild these schools? Question: How much will the rebuilds cost per square foot? Answer: The district estimates $208 per square foot in hard costs to rebuild elementary grade schools and $220 per square foot for the high schools. This is the mid-range for Portland Metro hard costs.Read the project estimating method for yourself. A school campaign opponent asked us to check out the claim. We obliged, thinking voters would want to know as well. Because, really, what the heck is a hard cost? The campaign openly links to the sheet we’ll be referencing to give you the skinny on costs. The "project estimating method" link on the website states that mid-point "hard construction" costs are indeed $208 a square foot for K-8 and $220 a square foot for high schools. (The calculations are by Rider Levett Bucknall, an international firm that estimates costs.) But hard construction costs, you see, are only a portion of the picture. There’s also on-site improvement "hard" costs estimated at $8 a square foot. That’s money to demolish and mitigate for hazardous materials, and to build walkways, outdoor learning space, storm drains, lighting, etc. There are "soft" costs for architecture work, engineering, planning, design, permitting and project management. These are estimated at an added 20 percent of hard costs. Let’s not forget contingency costs, which the district estimates at an added 15 percent of both "hard" and "soft" costs for complete renovations and 10 percent for new construction. And, finally, you can’t really run a school without "furniture, fixtures and equipment." Those costs are estimated at $12 a square foot, although the model warns us that numbers can vary. So what does this mean, as applied to these schools? Because as much as we’d like for the chief campaign backers to do the math for us, they haven’t. We requested and received school lot and building sizes from the district, because those aren’t posted either. We’ll skip the K-8 school and stick to the three high schools. (Roosevelt, by the way, is calculated at $190 a square foot for capacity reasons we won’t get into.) Here are the basics: Grant High School is 275,000 square feet, lot size is 444,000 square feet, estimated $95 million. Franklin is 240,000 square feet, lot size 797,000 square feet, estimated at $85 million. Roosevelt is 229,000 square feet, lot size 745,000 square feet, estimated at $70 million. And here are the numbers: school hard ($$) hard onsite soft contingency FFE cost/SF Grant $ 60.5 M $3.6 M $12.8 M $11.5 M $3.3 M $333 Franklin $ 52.8 M $6.4 M $11.8 M $10.7 M $2.9 M $353 Roosevelt $ 43.5 M $6 M $9.9 M $8.9 M $2.7 M $310 Those numbers are markedly different from $220. In fact, we’ll do more math for you. Grant’s $333 a square foot is 51 percent more than the stated $220 per square foot of "hard" construction costs. We asked the "Our Portland, Our Schools" campaign why not include an overall -- and higher -- figure as well. Spokeswoman Lindsey O’Brien said "hard costs" were closest to estimated construction costs so that’s what they posted. "The most important thing to us is the link to the full document, which goes through everything in detail," she said. It’s great that the campaign posted relevant information on its website. And apparently, it’s perfectly acceptable to compare "hard" construction costs within the industry. But breaking it down like that does little to help the average voter understand what it would cost per square foot to rebuild these historic high schools. And that was the question the campaign purportedly tried to answer. As we finished our reporting, we noticed that the campaign had added language to its website after our initial inquiry regarding hard costs: "Total project costs include hard costs (bricks, mortar, labor), soft costs (plans, permits), a contingency factor based on standard practice, and the contents needed to make a new building usable by students and staff." It would have been shorter -- and clearer -- to write that the total square footage price for Roosevelt High School is $310, for Grant $333, and for Franklin $353. Again, we turned to the campaign spokeswoman. Didn’t the school district say that this time, the construction bond measure would be leaner, meaner, more cost efficient and disciplined? It is, O’Brien said via email. Overall spending is lower, as well as the assessed rate for property owners. In other words, the district is not doing as much as in 2011. "We have not been arguing that the costs per square foot are different," she wrote. (By the way, Jim Owens with Portland Public Schools, who is in charge of the projects and has extensive experience in public construction and finance and who helped us with the details, said total square footage costs are reasonable and he didn’t think the square footage costs were too high in 2011 either.) Well, then. To our ruling: The campaign diligently uses the term "hard costs" to relay that square footage costs are estimated by the district at $220 per square foot. The campaign states repeatedly that these are "hard" costs, links to a way to get a more complete estimate, and now spells out to voters that other costs are required to make the new building "usable by students and staff." A statement can be accurate, but miss the mark on communicating the complete picture. In this case, total square footage price is estimated to be between $310 to $353 for the three high schools. Those numbers are a significant upgrade from the stated $220, and, guess what -- they are in the ballpark of the original square footage costs in the district’s first attempt at a bond. We decline for the time being to weigh in on the "reasonableness" of the hard costs or final costs. What we can say is that the difference amounts to a pretty important detail missing from the statement. We rule the statement Half True.

pomt-09900	The Obama administration offered "$900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/14/republican-national-committee-republican/RNC-poll-Hamas-Gaza/	The Republican National Committee recently put out a questionnaire called the "2009 Obama Agenda Survey" in which it asks Republicans to rate their agreement or disagreement with a number of so-called Obama administration positions. But it looks to us more like a push poll, a political technique in which the questions are written in a way that aims to convince the respondent of a particular political position. In other words, they are political statements masquerading as questions. We decided to fact-check two "questions" from the survey, and you'll see what we mean. One is an allegation that the Obama administration has ordered a new initiative that requires FBI agents to read Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield. We deal with that one in another Truth-O-Meter ruling . Here, we address the GOP question, "Do you support the Obama administration’s decision to offer $900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza?" As you can see, built into the "question" is a statement of fact, that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas to rebuild Gaza. During a trip to Egypt in early March 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the United States intends to provide $900 million for humanitarian, economic and security assistance for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people. Here's how that money would be split: $200 million to the Palestinian Authority to address part of its 2009 budget shortfall; $400 million "to help the Palestinian Authority solidify economic and institutional reforms in the West Bank"; and $300 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza following January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas. The humanitarian aid to Gaza would be distributed primarily through U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations. The strategy, according to State Department officials, was to specifically make sure the money did not go to Hamas. In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 30, Clinton assured that disbursement of the money "will be implemented with stringent requirements to prevent aid from being diverted into the wrong hands." Translation: Hamas. Some have argued, however, that the aid, while not going directly to Hamas, would still benefit them. "Whatever officials in Washington might intend, the Obama administration's new Gaza aid package is likely to turn out to be a financial boon for Hamas, which wields actual physical control over the places the aid is destined to go," wrote Ilan Berman, vice president for foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council, in an April commentary distributed by Tribune Media Services. Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations and an expert in U.S.-Middle East policy, said there are legitimate concerns about aid ending up in the hands of Hamas. The problem, he said, is that supposed nongovernmental groups that purport not to have ties with Hamas sometimes do. "We have yet to devise a foolproof system to ensure that money doesn't bleed out," Cook said. Still, he said, it's a wild distortion to claim that the United States has offered Hamas $900 million. First of all, most of the $900 million is going to the West Bank, not Gaza. And while some of the humanitarian aid disbursed through U.N. and other nongovernmental agencies could "bleed out" to Hamas unintentionally, that's far different from giving money directly to Hamas. Not only that, but the claim that the money would be used to "rebuild" Gaza after January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas is also misleading. The money to Gaza is for humanitarian aid — food, medicine, repairing damaged infrastructure, removing rubble, etc. It is specifically not for reconstruction, he said, as Israel was concerned that reconstruction money might be used to build tunnels, weapons factories or the like. "I'd give this one a D-minus," Cook said of the GOP claim. We agree that it's possible that even with safeguards, some of the humanitarian money could wind up in the hands of Hamas. But when you read the GOP survey, you are left with the impression that the U.S. government intends to write a big, fat $900 million check that says "Pay to the order of Hamas." To the contrary, Washington is taking steps to try to specifically make sure none of that money winds up in the hands of Hamas. We also note that only $300 million of the $900 million is even going to Gaza, for humanitarian aid. And the money is specifically not to be used for reconstruction. It is limited to humanitarian aid — food, medicine, that kind of thing. So the GOP is wrong on that point too. We rule the RNC's Hamas claim to be False.

pomt-02790	"Why would our president close the embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/dec/04/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-obama-closing-embassy-vatican/	‘Tis the season to make claims about holy matters. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is Catholic, tweeted on the day before Thanksgiving, "Why would our president close the embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare." Did President Barack Obama close the embassy to the Vatican as a way of sticking it to them over Obamacare? That sounds like some un-divine intervention. But is it the truth? (It would be a venial sin to omit a hat-tip to the Washington Post Fact Checker, which ran a check on this earlier today. CNN also did a fact check earlier.) The Holy See The Vatican maintains diplomatic relations with more than 175 countries. In 1984, the United States and the Vatican established full diplomatic relations, and the Senate confirmed the first ambassador. (Prior to that the United States had diplomatic relations on and off.) No country has an embassy to the Holy See within the Vatican City proper -- all of them are located within the city of Rome, according to the State Department. The current United States embassy is in a converted residential property in Rome, about 1.9 miles from the Vatican. The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See has seven U.S. diplomatic personnel, plus support staff. Its budget is just over $3.5 million, not counting costs associated with the local guard force, state department spokeswoman Pooja Jhunjhunwala told PolitiFact. "The U.S. Embassy to the Holy See is, and will remain, among the largest foreign missions to the Holy See," she said. While discussions about embassy security have increased in the wake of the deadly attack on a United States facility in Benghazi, Libya, the idea of relocating the embassy to the Vatican had been considered as long ago as 2005, after the addition to a building at the U.S. embassy compound in Rome, according to an Inspector General report in 2008, when George W. Bush was president. Currently, the embassy to the Vatican isn’t at the same spot as our embassy to Italy. One of the report recommendations for the embassy to the Vatican was to "relocate as soon as possible, with an eye towards cost savings, improved security, and maintaining as much as possible its separate identity to include a separate street address." Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy signed a memo approving the move in March 2013, but news about it swelled suddenly in November as some conservative news outlets criticized the plan. The National Republican Senatorial Committee created a petition to tell "President Obama to leave the American embassy at the Vatican." (NRSC took down the petition about five days later. That drew some fire from liberals, but NRSC spokesman Brad Dayspring said that’s a normal amount of time for the group to leave up such a petition.) An article in the National Catholic Reporter quoted several envoys who objected to the state department’s plan, including former U.S. Ambassador James Nicholson, a former secretary of Veterans Affairs in the Bush administration and a former chair of the Republican National Committee. He described the move as a "massive downgrade" in United States-Vatican ties. "It's turning this embassy into a stepchild of the embassy to Italy," Nicholson said. "The Holy See is a pivot point for international affairs and a major listening post for the United States," he said, "and to shoehorn (the U.S. delegation) into an office annex inside another embassy is an insult to American Catholics and to the Vatican." Other envoys who served under the first or second President Bush, along with one Clinton administration ambassador -- also objected, the National Catholic Reporter wrote. Current and former ambassadors under Obama supported the move. "I see no diminishing in the importance of the relationship at all," said current U.S. Ambassador Ken Hackett. And Miguel H. Diaz, a former ambassador under Obama, defended the move, saying, "This was done for security and financial reasons, not in any way to undermine and diminish the importance of the Holy See," CNN reported. The embassy shift Two days before Bush’s tweet, the State Department held a conference call with reporters to respond to the news reports. (The State Department didn’t name the official on the conference call.) The official stated that a few years ago, the government purchased land to expand an existing government compound in Rome and now plans to move the embassy there. The compound will have three separate buildings, each with their own entrances on different streets: the Embassy to the Holy See, the Embassy to the Republic of Italy and a U.S. Mission to the United Nations offices in Rome. The physical separation of the entrances is key because the Vatican requires embassies be separate from a country’s mission to Italy. The move was made due to cost and security, the State Department official told reporters. By consolidating operations at one compound, the state department expects to save about $1.4 million a year. The current embassy to the Vatican lacks "the kind of physical security protection that we would like it to have," the official said. "It doesn’t have the setback from the street that is available in its new compound, and … it does not have the level of other security protections, including Marine security guards that are available at the combined U.S. Government compound." The State Department official emphasized that the move does not represent any downsizing of the United States diplomatic assets. "There is no reduction in diplomatic staff, there’s no reduction in ambassadors, there’s no reduction in mission," he said. "There is simply a reduction in overhead." Shaun Casey, the special adviser for faith-based community initiatives at the State Department, described security as the No. 1 reason for the move. "The United States is moving the location of the embassy to a building that is safer, bigger, and architecturally more appealing," Casey wrote. "It also is slightly closer to Vatican City. Let me repeat that point: It's closer to Vatican City than the current location." To be precise, the new site will be located 1.78 miles from Vatican City, about one-tenth of a mile closer than the current site. It is expected to open in 2015. Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for the Vatican were unsuccessful, but a spokesman for the Vatican told CNN that "the move was well within the Holy See's requirements for embassies and that relations with the United States are far from strained. ... Another Vatican official, not authorized to speak on the record about diplomatic relations, told CNN the Holy See understands security concerns are an issue for some countries and this move is "an exception, not the ideal, but not the end of the world." Meanwhile, we found no evidence to support Bush’s speculation that the relocation might have had something to do with the battle between Catholic bishops and the federal government about contraception requirements in Obamacare. (Despite the contraception fight, the bishops have long backed the broader concept of universal health care.) "The Vatican itself said closing this location is not ideal," Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told PolitiFact. "Governor Bush does not believe this move reflects appropriate respect for the U.S. relationship with the Holy See." So what to make of the conflicting accounts about whether the move is a slight to the Vatican? "I think it’s not a big deal," Stephen F. Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America, told PolitiFact. Schneck, who has been to the embassy, called it an "ugly, modernistic residential structure." (Schneck told us he is close to the current ambassador and a couple of past ambassadors, including those that served under Obama and Bush.) "While I wouldn’t actually call it unworkable, it's on a corner so it’s very accessible to street traffic," Schneck said. "I certainly understand the security concerns." Schneck emphasized that the roots of the move predate Obama, since it stems from an inspector general recommendation during Bush’s tenure. And he was dubious of the suggestion that the embassy move is retaliation for the Catholic bishops opposing the contraception mandate in Obamacare. "I stand with my Catholic bishops in support of the lawsuits on the contraception mandate," Schneck said. However, the embassy-Obamacare connection is "a ridiculous effort, one of those crazy conspiracy theories to connect dots that make no sense at all." Our ruling Bush said, "Why would our president close the embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare." For starters, the United States is not going to "close" its embassy -- it’s relocating it to a place that’s closer to the Vatican and that is more secure, less expensive and more architecturally distinctive. In addition, the move didn’t originate with Obama. It has been in the works since George W. Bush -- Jeb Bush’s brother -- was president. Finally, we found no evidence to support the idea that the relocation was related to battles over Obamacare. We rate Bush’s claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05272	In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed legislation allowing non-citizens who are legal residents to vote in state and local elections.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/27/anastasia-williams/ri-rep-anastasia-williams-says-two-states-alabama-/	Rep. Anastasia Williams went before the House Judiciary Committee May 16 to propose that Rhode Island voters be asked to approve an amendment to the state Constitution that would give voting rights to non-citizens who are legal residents. She said the Ocean State wouldn't be the first to do so. "In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed this legislation," she told the committee. That statement surprised us. If non-citizens in Massachusetts were eligible to vote in state and local elections, we thought we would have heard about it. We decided to investigate. In her testimony, Williams said the intent of the proposal "is to give every legal resident of the state of Rhode Island the opportunity to be properly represented" when they are abiding by the law and paying taxes. She asserted that some elected officials won't help residents who aren't registered voters. (She reported that her Cuban mother was a legal resident who declined to seek citizenship out of fear of losing her ties to her country of origin.) Currently, only U.S. citizens can vote in federal, state and local elections in Rhode Island. Under the bill Williams supports, if voters amended the Constitution, legal permanent residents -- holders of the so-called "green card" -- would also be allowed to vote, after 30 days of residency. When we called Williams, she said the information came from the General Assembly's Legislative Council, which aids in drafting and researching legislation. House spokesman Larry Berman said the legislative research department made a mistake in a memo to Williams, with the wording suggesting that the proposals had become law in those states. They had not. In the meantime, we spoke with Brian McNiff, spokesman for the Massachusetts secretary of state's office and Julie Sinclair, a lawyer with the elections division of the Alabama secretary of state's office. Both confirmed that only citizens can vote in their states and both said an amendment to the state Constitution would be required to change that. Berman said the research that Williams relied upon from the General Assembly staff had been based on two bills, H-3430 in Massachusetts and SB-256 in Alabama. We tracked them down. The Massachusetts bill never got out of committee and called for permanent resident voting only in the town of Brookline. The reference to the Alabama legislation, a broad immigration bill, is even less relevant. As introduced, it specifically said that only citizens should be allowed to vote, the opposite of how Williams represented it. It did not make any reference to giving voting rights to permanent legal residents. And when it passed the Senate, the reference to who should be allowed to vote had been removed. So not only did the two pieces of legislation not become law, neither sought to give green-card holders the right to vote in statewide elections. Our ruling Rep. Anastasia Williams, advocating for her proposal to extend state and local voting rights to non-citizens who are permanent legal residents, told a House Judiciary Committee hearing, "In 2011, Alabama and Massachusetts passed this legislation." Williams said, and House spokesman Larry Berman confirmed, that she was relying on information from the General Assembly's Legislative Council, which should be a reliable source. In fact, the information Williams received was inaccurate. Neither state took such action. "At the time I made this statement, I relied on the inaccurate information that was provided to me," Williams said in a comment released Thursday. "This statement was not made intentionally." Said House Speaker Gordon Fox, "It is unfortunate that Representative Williams was quoting inaccurate information provided to her by a staff person and I am addressing this issue internally.". One last thought: we were surprised that a veteran legislator wasn't suspicious about the claim, given that Massachusetts is a neighbor and Alabama is known for having one of the nation's harshest laws against illegal immigrants. We rate her statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-05687	"In the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/13/hank-johnson/congressman-roughly-half-super-pac-money-coming-su/	This year’s primary elections are getting so nasty that Lithonia Congressman Hank Johnson has taken to calling them "slimary" elections. In an op-ed on liberal website "The Huffington Post," Johnson, a Democrat, blamed the viciousness on super PACs, political fundraising organizations that can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, corporations and unions alike. "In the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations," Johnson wrote in the Feb. 24 article. Those are some big bucks, wealthy people, and generous businesses. We wondered if Johnson got his numbers right. Super PACs became legal after a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision. They are an object of ire for those who think they can be used to buy elections and help donors obscure their identities. A Johnson spokesman said the congressman got his data from articles in Politico and Roll Call. The stories, which ran Feb. 8, lay out the findings of "Auctioning Democracy: The Rise of Super PACs & the 2012 Election." The report was authored by left-leaning policy and advocacy group Demos and U.S. Public Interest Research Group, or U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group. It argued that super PACs skew American politics by giving outsize influence to wealthy donors who hold views that do not represent those held by the broader public. Johnson’s account matched both news accounts’ descriptions of the "Auctioning Democracy" report. One of these descriptions could have been more precise, but they were not unreasonable. From the advent of super PACs to the end of 2011, donors have contributed a total of $181 million in what are called "itemized individual contributions" to super PACs, the report states. These are contributions from donors who give more than $200. Super PACs must report donor names once their contributions pass this threshold. The report did not tally contributions by small donors, said Adam Lioz, a Demos official and an author of the report. Demos and U.S. PIRG found that 196 people donated $100,000 or more to super PACs, which is just shy of 200 individuals. Calling them "super-rich" is polarizing, but it’s reasonable to assume that people who can afford to make a $100,000 donation have unusually high incomes. We used the report’s findings to calculate that donations of the "super-rich" amounted to about 43 percent of total contributions. This is some 7 percentage points lower than the "roughly half" figure that Johnson used. For-profit businesses contributed 17 percent of itemized donations, the report states. This is just shy of the 20 percent Johnson cited. We checked with the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for more transparency in government. It is the source of much of the data used in the report, so we wanted to get the organization’s take on the numbers. A spokesman said they found no problems with the conclusions of "Auctioning Democracy." But for the sake of due diligence, we compared the report’s numbers to data published by the Center for Responsive Politics, which keeps a rolling tally of super PAC contributions on its website OpenSecrets.org. The data from the CRP and the "Auctioning Democracy" report are not easy to compare. They track contributions over different time periods, and the CRP tallies a broader pool of contributions. However, we felt an analysis of the CRP data would give us a rough sense of whether Demos and U.S. PIRG overstated their results to make their case. First, we looked at the CRP’s count of total super PAC donations. From 2010 to late February, about $215 million had been donated to super PACs, according to the CRP data. This is about $35 million -- or 20 percent -- more than the data published in "Auctioning Democracy," but this difference did not signal major flaws. The CRP’s number should be significantly higher than the figures in "Auctioning Democracy." The report excludes donations of $200 or less as well as contributions for the 2012 calendar year. The CRP includes them. Next, we looked at whether "roughly half" of super PAC donations came from 200 "super-rich" people. The CRP publishes a list of the top 100 super PAC donors for the 2012 election cycle on its website. We found they donated about $74 million so far, or 57 percent of the cycle’s $130 million total. The count in "Auctioning Democracy" was lower, which suggests that Demos and U.S. PIRG did not overstate the significance of donations from the "super-rich." We had difficulty using the CRP’s data to check corporate or business donations. The CRP’s Web page lists too few organizations, and does not distinguish between for-profit businesses and groups such as labor unions or advocacy organizations. Our ruling Johnson wrote that "[i]n the last two years, super PACs raised more than $180 million -- with roughly half of it coming from fewer than 200 super-rich people and roughly 20 percent from corporations." On balance, Johnson’s claim reflects the findings of a report by two advocacy groups that are critical of super PACs. The statistics Johnson uses also make sense in light of data published by a separate group. We give Johnson a True.	None	Hank Johnson	None	None	None	2012-03-13T06:00:00	2012-02-24	['None']
pomt-06694	Rail "doesn’t do a great job in lessening traffic."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/06/chip-rogers/does-commuter-rail-ease-traffic/	The vote may be a year away, but politicians are already taking sides on a bid to raise taxes for more roads and rail in metro Atlanta. If it passes, the 2012 transportation referendum would bring more than $6 billion for a regional project list for the gridlocked area, possibly including a new rail line between Cobb County and Midtown. So far, though, political leaders in car-centric Cobb are less than thrilled, according to an Aug. 23 article in The Marietta Daily Journal. State Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers is thinking about voting "no" on the 1-percent, 10-year sales tax. "We know that rail offers some things that you can't get from just building roads, but we also know that rail doesn't do a great job in lessening traffic," Rogers said. "And at a time when we need traffic to be lessened significantly, I don't know that we would put 55 percent of all our resources into that alone." Rogerswas referring to the 55 percent-45 percent split for mass transit -- which includes rail and buses -- to roads in the metro Atlanta project list for the 2012 transportation referendum. The list is a draft that faces further approval. Rogers, whose Woodstock district also includes portions of Cobb County, expanded on his remarks in an email to PolitiFact Georgia. He cited a number of studies to make his point. "While I readily admit that transit may have a number of benefits that should be considered for infrastructure investment, relieving traffic congestion is not one of the major benefits," he wrote. Rail doesn’t do a great job of reducing traffic? Doesn’t rail get cars off the roads? Transportation experts said that rail’s impact is difficult to suss out. Congestion is influenced by so many variables, including population growth, the economy and geography, that researchers differ on rail’s exact impact. On its face, the problem seems simple. If a person who commutes alone by car takes the train instead, then that’s one less car on the road. But multiple experts told PolitiFact Georgia that even if thousands of drivers take the train rather than a major road, congestion on that road doesn’t end. It might drop initially, but travelers soon notice the better traffic. Commuters who once avoided the road return. Others take additional trips, or start using it during peak traffic times. People who carpooled start commuting alone. Eventually, congestion returns, said Anthony Downs, a Brookings Institution fellow who has studied traffic congestion for decades. He thinks congestion is extremely hard to avoid, and will likely grow worse. Brookings is a liberal-leaning think tank. Rogershas a point, he said. "He is correct, but he is stating it very simply," Downs said. For instance, a 2009 University of Toronto study that analyzed interstate highway and vehicle travel data across the U.S. found there is little evidence that additional public transit reduces traffic. Other researchers have come to similar conclusions. But there’s another important side to the traffic conundrum, and Rogers didn’t address it. Decades of research shows that additional highway lanes don’t end gridlock, either. As with rail, drivers fill up the new lanes. Once again, they’re stuck in traffic. "Nothing solves the congestion problem. Neither option [cars or rail] takes precedent," said Catherine Ross, director of Georgia Tech’s Center for Quality Growth. A past board member of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, she thinks rail can create better commutes and improve a region’s overall quality of life. Some experts told PolitiFact Georgia that this does not mean rail has no chance of impacting traffic. Downs noted that if a city built a rail line alongside a major roadway with stops at busy exits, it could have a shot. And University of California at Berkeley Professor Robert Cervero said that such a line can have an especially big impact on congestion during rush hour because research shows rail carries a large share of travelers during those times. Indeed, a 2003 report published by the World Bank on 14 cities suggests that transit, including rail, does have a modest impact on congestion. People drive even less if a city has many characteristics that make using transit more attractive, such as high density and easy access. One expert argued that rail could have a major impact on traffic. Professor Vukan Vuchic, a University of Pennsylvania professor of city and regional planning, said that a long-term transportation and development plan that encourages drivers to use transit and makes it inconvenient to drive could reduce congestion. And speaking of inconvenient places to drive -- consider New York City. Experts noted that its rail helps the city accommodate far more travelers than the roads could. This avoids gridlock that those travelers would create. In the end, though, the bulk of the experts we interviewed agreed that the one tested way to cut down on gridlock is "congestion pricing." That’s when drivers pay a surcharge to use roads during peak traffic hours. Cities such as London and Singapore have used the strategy and eased downtown traffic. How do we rule? Rogers’ claim was that rail "doesn't do a great job in lessening traffic," and there is a great deal of truth to this. A rail line can do many things. It can take drivers off the road. A well-designed line has a shot at impacting congestion. And if a city or neighborhood is especially dense and designed around rail, it can’t prosper without it. But rail alone cannot end congestion. A few experts argue that it does little to nothing. That said, Rogers left out an important fact that might have opened his take on the transportation tax to obvious criticism: No increase in capacity -- not even the construction of new road lanes -- can end congestion. Roads and rail have similar effects. Rogers’ statement is accurate, but could have used a little more context. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-12266	Spicer: "Trump has the legal right to cancel SCOTUS because they serve at his pleasure"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/06/blog-posting/its-fake-news-president-can-disband-supreme-court/	A June 21 fake news story on USPOLN.com reported that White house press secretary Sean Spicer declared that the president holds the power to disband the U.S. Supreme Court. "President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision," Spicer is quoted as saying in the story. The story claims Spicer shared this information in a press briefing media outlets were banned from airing, in which he also announced Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to the victims of a U.S. Navy ship wreckage and of a terrorist attack in London. The press conference the post references indeed took place, on June 19. While it was not televised, a transcript was shared on the White House website. Spicer did offer the White House’s condolences to the victims and said Mueller’s fate was in Trump’s hands, but he never suggested the president holds the power to disband the Supreme Court. In fact, the Supreme Court was not mentioned during the briefing. The story manipulated Spicer’s quote that "everyone who serves the president serves at the pleasure of the President," referring to the fact that Mueller’s superior, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, ultimately answers to the president. The Supreme Court, however, does not. The checks and balances put in place by the U.S. Constitution are designed to ensure equilibrium of power between the legislative, executive and judicial branches — that means one branch can’t just shut down another. The Constitution prohibits the president from firing a justice, much less all nine of them, or disbanding the institution they represent. It also hands power over to the courts to decide on the legality of an executive action. The president may nominate Supreme Court justices, court of appeals judges and district court judges, although these must be vetted by the Senate. Neil Gorsuch is the only Supreme Court justice Trump has appointed so far. The website that published the story did not respond to a request for comment, but it does contain a disclaimer published in the "about us" tab. "USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist," the disclaimer reads. "These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." While some of the details about the press conference are correct, Spicer’s comments about the presidential ability to disband the courts is complete and total baloney.

pomt-07255	Says he vetoed $250,000 from the budget for a program to learn how to catch rainwater.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/may/27/rick-scott/water-savings-plan-doesnt-escape-rick-scotts-veto-/	Among the $615 million in budget vetoes Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced at a ceremonial event May 26, 2011, Scott highlighted one -- $250,000, he said, earmarked to learn how to catch rainwater. "Where I'm from, rainwater can be caught with a two-dollar bucket," he said. Was that really in the budget? Scott described the $250,000 in his list of vetoes as a "water savings plan." The list included the specific line item where the expenditure could be found in the 400-plus-page budget, so we went there to see if Scott described accurately what the money was for. The money, it turns out, was tucked into the Department of Corrections budget. Here's the exact language: "From the funds in Specific Appropriations 595 through 688A, $250,000 in recurring general revenue funds is provided to the Department of Corrections to issue a request for proposal, as defined in section 287.057(1)(b), Florida Statutes, for the development of a water savings plan that creates performance standards for rain water harvesting and water reuse to achieve annual cost savings of at least 25 percent from the 2008, 2009, and 2010 calendar years. By no later than September 30, 2011, the department shall identify a vendor to conduct and inventory the water consumption of all department facilities consuming water for irrigation, gray water or drinking water purposes, including an inventory of each facility’s roof surface area. To achieve these cost savings objectives, the vendor shall submit a plan to the department by February 1, 2012, which identifies the most cost-effective plan for the procurement of services and cistern products and establishes performance standards for the efficient and effective use of water resources and estimates of future potential savings and other related benefits." In short, the $250,000 was to be spent to develop a plan to catch and collect rain water so that it could lower prison water costs by 25 percent. So while developing the plan would have cost the state $250,000, the idea was to save the state some money on water costs -- we don't know how much (and asked the Department of Corrections, for the record, but did not hear back). "I'm sure most Floridians believe as I do that spending $250,000 on education materials for our kids is more important that spending a quarter of a million dollars to learn how to catch rainwater," Scott said in announcing the veto. Where did the request for the money come from? Not the Department of Corrections, said spokeswoman Gretl Plesinger. Plesinger said the money was not included in the department's legislative budget request. And the money was not included in the version of the budget that initially passed the House. In fact, it seems the idea came from someone in the Senate. The water savings plan was included in the original Senate budget proposal, and remained in the budget that the Senate initially passed. Actually, the Senate proposed spending $500,000 on the creation of the water savings plan. The amount was lowered to $250,000 as part of negotiations between the House and Senate. There's no doubt, then, that Scott was right, that included in the 2011-12 budget was a $250,000 appropriation to develop a plan to catch and collect water (he said "learn"). But there's an important note that he left out in announcing his budget vetoes. The budget language that included the appropriation said the water savings plan was supposed to reduce prison water costs by 25 percent. The savings could have offset or at least cut into the upfront investment. So we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-05-27T15:46:55	2011-05-26	['None']
pomt-03650	Long-term federal investment in U.S. airports is urgent because "there was a recent survey of the top airports … in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/01/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-no-airports-ranked-top-25/	During a press conference on April 30, 2013, President Barack Obama addressed a number of high-profile issues, including the fighting in Syria, the Boston Marathon attack, immigration legislation and the across-the-board cuts to federal spending known as the sequester. On the sequester, Obama expressed his ambivalence about signing a bill that passed Congress a few days earlier. The bill, which would ease the sequester’s hit on the Federal Aviation Administration, moved quickly through the House and Senate amid public frustration. The flight delays stemmed from cuts to air traffic control staffing; the bill shifted $253 million from an airport improvement fund to the air traffic control system. Obama said the pressure on air travelers left him with little choice but to sign the bill, but he also decried the piecemeal approach to solving the nation’s budget and infrastructure challenges. If lawmakers were "seriously concerned about passenger convenience and safety," Obama said, "then they shouldn't just be thinking about tomorrow or next week or the week after that. They should be thinking about what's going to be happening five years from now, 10 years from now or 15 years from now. … How are we making sure that we're investing in things like rebuilding our airports and our roads and our bridges, and investing in early childhood education?" Obama added: "There was a recent survey of the top airports … in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25. Not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world. I think Cincinnati airport came in around 30th. What does that say about our long-term competitiveness and future?" We wondered whether this survey really showed U.S. airports to be such a dismal lot. As it turns out, Obama got the numbers right. He was referring to the World Airport Awards, an independent, annual survey of 12 million travelers that ranks nearly 400 airports. The survey has been conducted by a British-based firm called Skytrax since 1999. The top-ranked U.S. airport in the group’s 2013 survey was indeed Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in the 30th spot. The airports ranking higher than that include a dozen in Asia (including the top two, Singapore Changi Airport and Incheon International Airport), seven in Europe, three in Africa, two in Australia, and just one in North America (Vancouver International Airport, at No. 8). In all, 17 U.S. airports cracked the top 100, with Denver 36th, San Francisco 40th, Atlanta 48th and none of the rest ending up higher than 50th. The 2013 results were not a fluke: We checked the 2012 and 2011 surveys as well and found that the top U.S. airport in both years was also Cincinnati, ranking 24th. We checked with Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International, a trade group for airports, to see what she thought of the rankings. She began by expressing skepticism about the survey’s rigor. (The firm says it surveys passengers online and by phone and uses systems to detect fraudulent submissions.) She added that the U.S. faces some stiff challenges competing in a global comparison of this sort. "Major international hubs in the U.S. are sometimes hampered by long immigration and security queues, which would hurt their rankings in comparison to an airport with primarily domestic service, such as Cincinnati," Gittens said. Cincinnati, which outperformed no fewer than 50 U.S. airports that have larger traffic, is hardly an international hub on the scale of New York’s JFK, Los Angeles or Miami. Peter Miller, a spokesman for Skytrax, agreed. He said the U.S. may be suffering in the survey because of the importance of security processing and immigration to many passengers -- "not just actual waiting times, but also traveler treatment in these areas." Gittens added that U.S. airports have a hard time competing with newer airports in Asia. In many countries, she said, "the national governments see their airports as key assets for their economic vitality and strive to make the visitors’ journey through the airport as smooth as possible." So the rankings Obama cited should be taken with a grain of salt. More important, the rankings don’t entirely support the president’s argument that the federal government needs to spend more money "rebuilding our airports" and providing for "passenger convenience and safety." Of the 39 factors that went into the survey’s rankings, we count only 13 that address airport capital improvements -- projects like terminal and waiting-area design, signage, public transit access, ease of navigation, and baggage-handling systems. Another five factors in the survey involve security. This leaves a slight majority of factors that concern amenities and hospitality -- factors such as choice of bars, shopping options, restaurant prices, entertainment facilities, washroom cleanliness, availability of luggage trolleys, and "friendliness of airport staff." "The survey covers a wide cross-section of amenities and facilities at every airport, but it is true to say that one of the most prominent sections is the focus on service, staff, convenience, and waiting times," said Peter Miller, a spokesman for Skytrax. "These are the issues that are of prime importance to travelers, and which cause the biggest distinction between airports worldwide." Our ruling Obama said the United States needs to invest more in its airports over the long term in part because "there was a recent survey of the top airports … in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25." He is spot-on about the rankings, but the survey in question offers only imperfect support for the argument that the federal government should invest more in its airports, since the survey measures not just major infrastructure aspects of airports (which the federal government would help fund) but also passenger amenities (something the government would not get directly involved in). We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-05-01T11:50:30	2013-04-30	['United_States']
pomt-03789	The national debt is "larger than our entire annual economy."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/28/jim-jordan/rep-jim-jordan-says-national-debt-larger-our-entir/	Budget-cutting is a favorite theme for Champaign County Rep. Jim Jordan, a former Republican Study Committee chairman with the most conservative voting record of any Ohio Congress member. Jordan has frequently opined that the controversial sequester budget cuts implemented on March 1 are a positive step toward reining in out-of-control government spending. On March 19, the House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending that Jordan chairs held a hearing on how several government departments decided where to make cuts required by the sequester. At the hearing, Republicans and Democrats blamed each other for the $85 billion in cuts to government programs that were implemented after Congress failed to agree on an alternative. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's representative to Congress, rattled off the list of cuts to agencies testifying before the hearing: $2 billion to the Agriculture Department, $551 million to the Commerce Department, and $17 million to the Federal Communication Commission and concluded: "This hearing really should be entitled: 'Sequestration Oversight; What Were House Republicans Thinking.'" Jordan responded to her speech by saying: "The reason we support reducing spending in sequestration is because we have a debt larger than our entire annual economy. We do have to cut some spending around this place and we’re finally taking some modest first steps." Jordan’s point about the national debt being larger than the entire U.S. annual economy is becoming a familiar GOP talking point. A few days before Jordan spoke at the hearing, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan made a virtually identical statement in a speech at Washington, D.C.’s Conservative Political Action Conference, saying "Our debt is already bigger than our economy." PolitiFact has examined that statement and several other similar ones, noting that the politicians’ government debt tally included IOUs between government agencies, which don’t affect the wider economy and credit markets as much as publicly held debt, which totals 75 percent of GDP. To find the size of the economy, PolitifFact national cited a Feb. 28, 2013 news release from The Bureau of Economic Analysis that put the GDP at just over $15.8 trillion. The government defines the GDP -- gross domestic product -- as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country. As for the debt, the U.S. Treasury is the go-to source. As of March 14, 2013, total outstanding public debt was $16,708,225,460,175.14. That’s broken down into two categories: debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings. Here are those dollar figures: Debt held by the public: $11.9 trillion Intragovernmental holdings: $4.8 trillion To explain the difference, we’ll borrow from our PolitiFact Texas colleagues’ handiwork. Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, Josh Gordon, an analyst with the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, told PolitiFact Texas. "If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market." Paul Van de Water, an economist with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, further explained why that matters. "Debt held by the public is important because it reflects the extent to which the government goes into private credit markets to borrow. Such borrowing draws on private national saving and international saving and therefore competes with investment in the nongovernmental sector (for factories and equipment, research and development, housing, and so forth). Large increases in such borrowing can also push up interest rates and increase the future interest payments the federal government must make to foreign lenders, which reduces Americans’ income. Achieving a stable debt-to-GDP ratio is a key test of fiscal sustainability," Van de Water wrote in a memo. So, if we just consider debt held by the public -- which is what most affects the economy -- it totals about 75 percent of GDP -- which is not larger than the entire economy, as Ryan and Jordan stated. But the pair aren’t entirely off-base, especially since partisans tend to disagree about the importance of intragovernmental holdings. "When you dig a bit deeper, you hit a partisan debate about the portion of the debt not held by the public, most of which is held by the government in trust funds. Republicans say that the trust funds are filled with IOUs, which eventually will have to be redeemed with other funds. Democrats say that the trust funds represent binding promises that government has made to tens of millions of Americans. They’re both right," said William Galston, an expert with the Brookings Institution who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton. When we asked Jordan’s press secretary if there was additional information that PolitiFact Ohio should consider in evaluating her boss’ assertion, she replied: "The facts are correct behind Rep. Jordan’s statement: economy - $15.8 trillion, debt - $16.7 trillion." Jordan claimed "we have a debt larger than our entire annual economy." If you count debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings, the debt is roughly 105 percent of the economy, which makes his statement accurate. But the debt held by the public is more relevant to discussions about federal spending and the economy. With that clarification, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-13751	Says unlike Tim Kaine, who "invested" in education, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence "slashed education funding."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/24/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-mike-pence-slashed-education-/	Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both picked men with executive experience as their running mates. Mike Pence, Trump’s vice presidential pick, is the governor of Indiana, and Sen. Tim Kaine, running alongside Clinton, served as Virginia’s governor from 2006 to 2010. Clinton compared their gubernatorial records at a July 23 rally in Miami. "While Mike Pence slashed education funding in Indiana and gave more tax cuts to the wealthiest, Tim Kaine cut his own salary and invested in education from pre-K through college and beyond," she said. There’s a lot to unpack in there. We were especially curious, though, about Clinton’s comparison of their education records. At the Republican National Convention, Pence said that as Indiana’s governor, he has made "record investments in education," and we rated that claim Half True. We found that Clinton’s claim that Kaine "invested" in education while Pence "slashed education funding" is an exaggeration at best. Pence Indiana has not "slashed" education funding under Pence’s leadership. In fact, it’s been on the rise every year since Pence took office in 2013. Not adjusting for inflation, Indiana state spending for K-12 and higher education combined hit record highs in 2014 through the current year, according to data compiled by Larry DeBoer, a professor of agricultural economics at Indiana’s Purdue University. When adjusted for inflation, the rise isn’t so dramatic, but it’s still there. (For calculating the inflation-adjusted spending, DeBoer used 1982-84 dollars according to the Consumer Price Index.) Create your own infographics The Clinton campaign pointed out that Pence asked universities to cut their state spending by 2 percent in fiscal year 2014 to account for a revenue shortfall. And the 2015 state budget took money from some urban school districts and redistributed them to suburban districts, which some commentators saw as disproportionately benefiting wealthier students. Pence did, though, successfully push for $15 million to fund a preschool program for poor families. Kaine Education spending in Virginia actually went down under Kaine, who served as governor from 2006 through 2010. However, Kaine took office in a relatively healthy economy that soon gave way to the recession in 2007, which squeezed state budgets across the country. In raw dollars, state spending on K-12 and higher education under Kaine increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009, to a high of $7.5 billion, according to figures compiled by Chris Duncombe, a policy analyst at the Commonwealth Institute, a liberal Virginia think tank. There was a very slight dip in 2008 when adjusting the figures for inflation. Then in 2010, it fell to $6.8 billion, and that includes $365 million from the federal government to support the economic recovery. Create line charts The Clinton campaign said Kaine expanded pre-kindergarten programs, and he signed a 2006 bond bill that set out to provide $1.5 billion for construction projects at Virginia colleges and universities. The campaign also noted that in 2006, Kaine signed a bill to establish a framework for bringing Virginia teacher salaries up to the national average. However, the state ended up having to rescind a 2 percent raise for state employees and teachers before it went into effect in 2008 in the wake of the recession. "Sen. Kaine was dealt a poor hand to fund public education, or anything else for that matter," said Richard Salmon, a professor emeritus and expert in public education at Virginia Tech. "However, the funding reductions that befell public schools have not been attributed to Sen. Kaine by supporters of public education, and most feel that the reductions would have been even more severe if someone else had been governor," Salmon said. Salmon noted that public school funding still hasn’t fully recovered from the recession cuts. Our ruling Clinton said that unlike Tim Kaine, who "invested" in education in Virginia, Mike Pence "slashed education funding" in Indiana. The clear implication from Clinton’s statement is that Pence cut education in Indiana while Kaine grew it in Virginia. That sends voters an inaccurate message. Pence made various individual cuts and investments in education, but overall state spending has increased every year in his term so far. Kaine made notable investments in certain educational projects as Virginia’s governor, but state education spending shrunk overall throughout his term. However, this was primarily because the recession caused massive budget shortfalls.

pomt-06660	"Since the beginning of the year we've created a net increase of 45,000 jobs."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/12/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-touts-administration-role-creating/	Gov. John Kasich recently appeared on Fox News — his old stomping grounds — to tout Ohio’s improved credit and economic outlook. In an interview on "Fox and Friends," the governor noted that Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services had recently announced that it was upping Ohio’s credit outlook to stable from negative, but that it was keeping the state’s actual credit rating at AA+. The vote of confidence is good news, because if S&P decides to increase the rating to AAA in the future, it would make it cheaper for the state to borrow money. S&P showed Ohio some love after Kasich and like-minded legislators approved a state budget that covered a projected deficit estimated in the billions and because the state was undergoing a modest economic recovery. In the interview, Kasich rightly took credit for the budget balancing, adding that the improved credit outlook sends a message that Ohio is a good place to do business. And among his comments: "Since the beginning of the year we’ve created a net increase of 45,000 jobs. Our unemployment has ticked up because we’re not creating as many jobs as we need, but the fact is we are net up in job creation." Creating jobs is Kasich’s job one, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. The statistic itself is easy to check. Ohio did add 45,100 jobs from the end of January through July, according to Ohio Labor Market Information, a division of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. In fact, if you include January (Kasich was sworn in Jan. 10), you could add another 34,100 jobs since the first of the year. But can the governor take credit for the job growth, as he seemed to be doing on Fox News? Specifically, Kasich said the improved credit outlook, "sends a signal, not just to the citizens here but to businesses in our state and businesses around the country that Ohio is open for business because at the end of the day you want to make sure that you’re creating jobs and since the beginning of the year we’ve created a net increase of 45,000 jobs. Our unemployment has ticked up because we’re not creating as many jobs as we need, but the fact is we are net up in job creation." Politicians like to tout good things that happen on their watch (or bad things on their opponent’s). As his term was about to expire, outgoing Gov. Strickland noted the state’s unemployment trend was already improving, just in time for Kasich to take credit for it. "We are one of only two states to have eight consecutive months of declining unemployment," Strickland said. PolitiFact Ohio checked the numbers and rated his claim True. On the flip side, Republicans hammered Strickland over Ohio job losses during the gubernatorial campaign. In their campaign against Strickland. "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch," the Republican Governors Association proclaimed in an attack ad. PolitiFact Ohio rated that claim Half True. The number was correct, but it was inaccurate to put all the blame for Ohio’s economic woes on Strickland. Two experts we talked to agreed Kasich’s policies are pro-business. But neither believes Kasich can take credit for the creation of 45,100 jobs. What really drives job creation is the business cycle, and that began to turn around in June of 2009, said Ken Mayland, an economist with ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio. Job creation numbers going back to January 2010 prove that out. Ohio has created 104,300 jobs over that time. "It helps to have the business cycle for you as opposed to against you," Mayland said. Just ask former President George H.W. Bush. The elder Bush lost his re-election to Bill Clinton despite a recovering economy, Mayland said, because the perception was that the economy was doing poorly. Clinton "basically rode the economic wave upwards through the rest of the ’90s, or a good part of ’90s," he said. Leroy Brooks, Mellen Chair of Finance at John Carroll University, also credits the job growth during Kasich’s term so far to a continuation of what started last year when demand for Ohio products started to increase and inventories started coming down. "He did not cause the growth we had in the first couple quarters," Brooks said. That said, Brooks would agree that Kasich’s policies are more likely to produce jobs, but if the economy retrenches as some are predicting, it won’t really matter. The governor stands by his statement. His spokesman Rob Nichols claims Strickland would have hiked taxes to balance the budget and that would have hurt job creation. "We would not be creating the jobs we are now," he said. He further cites an CNBC survey that pushed Ohio from 34 to 23 in its rankings for "America’s top states for business." But that misses the point. There is an element of truth in the governor’s statement: Ohio did add 45,100 jobs from the end of January through July. But the portion of the statement where the governor says "we’ve created" the jobs ignores some critical facts that would give a different impression. While the economists we talked to agree that the governor’s policies could be good for job creation or retention in the long run, they also agree it’s too soon to tell. There hasn’t been enough time for them to kick in, they say. Standard & Poors cited Ohio’s balanced budget as having a positive impact, but that didn’t happen until the end of June. Ohio has registered job growth since early last year, well before Kasich was elected. And while his efforts have received some positive reviews, there are many factors beyond the governor’s office that impact job growth. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-01378	"Under the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, northern Wisconsin’s mining economy is moving forward and more people are getting good, high-paying jobs."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/16/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperty-says-workers-are-getting-high-/	The state law that aims to help Gogebic Taconite move ahead with an iron ore mine in northern Wisconsin stands as one of the most important pieces of legislation passed under Gov. Scott Walker. The bill -- which the company helped shape -- sped up the permitting process and made other changes to state laws to encourage development of the mine, a project billed as potentially bringing thousands of jobs to a sparsely populated part of the state with high unemployment. Gogebic has said that construction of the mine and its related processing plants and infrastructure would create 3,000 jobs. Once operating, the mine would employ about 700 people, with a projected 2,834 total jobs created from related businesses. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group, reminded voters of Walker’s support for the mine in a flier mailed to voters in early October with the headline: "Wisconsin is back to work." Next to a image of a mining helmet, the flier states: "Under the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, northern Wisconsin’s mining economy is moving forward and more people are getting good, high-paying jobs." The statement carries a footnote to Senate Bill 1, the mining bill sought by Gogebic and approved by the Republican-held Legislature and Walker in 2013. Taken together, that suggests a boom in jobs related to the iron ore mine. But we heard a different explanation when we asked AFP’s Wisconsin office for backup. "We didn’t indicate any specific type of job," said David Fladeboe, state director for Americans for Prosperity Foundation-Wisconsin. "We simply stated that the mining economy is allowing folks to get good high-paying jobs." He added: "Many jobs have been created both directly and indirectly because of the iron mine and even more have been created thanks to sand mining." Wait. Sand mining? In addition to the footnote citing the iron mining bill, the mailing specifically cited "Northern Wisconsin’s mining economy," and made no mention of sand mining. Let’s take a closer look. Gogebic moving slowly Let’s start with the iron ore mine, a proposed $1.5 billion project in Iron and Ashland counties. Field work on the sprawling site in the Penokee Hills got underway in early 2014. Roads were built and rock samples were taken. But in August 2014, Gogebic announced a delay. Saying more preliminary work needs to be done, the company pushed filing of its planned application back from spring 2015 to fall 2015. Once an application is filed, state regulators have a year to consider it. And then there are the promises of legal challenges from environmentalists and the Chippewa Indians who oppose the project. So we are early in the process. Even though there’s no mine, some miners -- technically they’re operating engineers who run heavy equipment -- are working at the site, said Gogebic spokesman Bob Seitz. They’re building roads and extracting and crushing rock samples. "We’ve had maybe 10 operators working up there at any given time," said Terry McGowan, president and business manager of Operating Engineers Local 139, the union involved. Those workers are paid about $37 an hour. So that’s 10 miners. To be sure, the mine’s impact would extend beyond those wearing hard hats and would boost other jobs in the local economy. Fladeboe from Americans for Prosperity made that argument in an email exchange with us. Seitz said Gogebic has spent $1.25 million in Iron and surrounding counties so far in 2014. That covers local salaries, consulting fees, motels and lodging, equipment, vehicles, meals, offices and local well drillers and equipment operators. "From spring through the summer, we averaged over 20 people per day physically on the site," Seitz said. The company’s office in Hurley has six workers. He pointed out that "$1.25 million dollars invested in a county with 5,700 people with household incomes among the lowest in the state supports a lot of jobs." Sand mining growing In backing his statement, Fladeboe argued there has also been a boom in the number of sand mining jobs in Wisconsin. That wasn’t part of the original claim, but it is accurate. There are sand mines operating in about 20 counties in western and northwestern Wisconsin, and the state Department of Natural Resources says there are now 140 mines, processing plants and rail sites for sand mining in the state. That compares with five mines and five processing plants in 2010, shortly before Walker took office. A study released in September 2014 by environmental groups -- the Civil Society Institute's Boston Action Research, the Environmental Working Group and Madison-based Midwest Environmental Advocates -- predicts that sand mining will continue to grow and perhaps expand to as many as two dozen other counties. The nearest sand mine to the proposed Gogebic mine, though, is about 120 miles south. Did the passage of SB1, which focused on the iron mine, contribute to the sand mining boom? Fladeboe argues yes. But the bill itself doesn’t make any reference to sand mining. Here’s how the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau described it: "This bill creates new statutes for regulating iron mining and modifies the current laws regulating metallic mining so that they cover only mining for non ferrous minerals." McGowan, the union leader, said the mining law sent a signal that makes all kinds of mining more acceptable. But he noted "frac sand mining was taking off before" the bill was passed. Our rating A direct mail flier from Americans for Prosperity says that "Under the administration of Gov. Scott Walker, northern Wisconsin’s mining economy is moving forward and more people are getting good, high-paying jobs." It cites the bill aimed at the iron mine as its evidence. But that mine is far from being constructed or open. About "maybe 10" well-paid operating engineers have worked there. To be sure, there’s been a boom in the state’s sand mining industry. But that’s not the subject of the statement. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2014-10-16T05:00:00	2014-10-03	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']
pomt-14609	"This is the true picture of ‘Milwaukee's Renaissance’ after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/02/bob-donovan/truly-picture-milwaukees-renaissance-under-mayor-t/	In his campaign for mayor of Milwaukee, Ald. Bob Donovan has criticized the record of Mayor Tom Barrett on crime, the incumbent’s support for a downtown streetcar and the conditions of the city’s neighborhoods. On Jan. 29, 2016, about two weeks ahead of the primary election, Donovan posted on his campaign Facebook page an attack that included a photograph of a dilapidated home. The home was pocked by broken or boarded-up windows, torn-off siding and holes in exterior walls. "This is the true picture of ‘Milwaukee's Renaissance’ after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership," Donovan’s post began. The post had been shared more than 80 times over the next three days. But it didn’t take that long for a Facebook reader to question how true of a picture it was. Several hours after Donovan’s posting, someone identified on Facebook as Gilberto Gonzales Jr. posted a reply, saying: "This structure was used by the Milwaukee Fire Department for a training fire. It is scheduled for demolition. Prior to that fire it did not look like that. This photo by itself is deceiving." Gonzalez, it turns out, is someone who would know -- a lieutenant in the Milwaukee Fire Department who was the lead instructor of its training division until 2015. Donovan responded on Facebook that evening, saying: "Perhaps that's the case, Gilberto. But if you're familiar with the corner, you know too that there's about five additional boarded-up homes in eyesight, a fact that is not deceiving. By the way, I was not familiar with the history of the building, but quite frankly I have seen similar dilapidated residences in my travel throughout the city." The Fire Department confirmed to us that the house, at 3068 N. 20th St., was used for training -- including with live fires in October 2015, which explains the large holes in the structure. The department chose it for training after it was put on the city’s demolition list. Eventually it will be demolished. Donovan told us he didn’t realize the house is in such a condition because of the training. But he contended that didn’t detract from his overall point about deteriorating neighborhoods, saying "I’m certain we’d have no problem locating another home that looks like that" in Milwaukee’s inner city. But whether other homes look something like that one doesn’t bear on whether Donovan’s Facebook statement is accurate. In the nearly six years of PolitiFact Wisconsin, we’ve rated dozens of claims as Pants on Fire. That includes three made by Barrett during his gubernatorial campaigns against Gov. Scott Walker. But none of the POFs were related to actual flames. Until now. Our rating Donovan said in a Facebook post: "This is the true picture of ‘Milwaukee's Renaissance’ after 12 years of Mayor Tom Barrett's leadership." The post included a picture of a dilapidated home, all right. But the condition is explained by the fact that the city Fire Department has set fires inside it and blasted holes in it for training. Donovan’s statement is false and ridiculous -- our definition of Pants on Fire.	None	Bob Donovan	None	None	None	2016-02-02T08:52:56	2016-01-29	['Tom_Barrett_(politician)', 'Milwaukee']
pomt-01257	"According to recent reports, a group of death panels organized under Obamacare ordered their first execution."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/11/americannewscom/first-execution-under-obamacare-death-panels-pants/	An old piece of Affordable Care Act mythology has come back from the dead: death panels. A reader sent us a link to a September American News article that claims an 86-year-old woman was ordered executed after a panel established by the Affordable Care Act determined that "she is no longer useful." "According to recent reports, a group of death panels organized under Obamacare ordered their first execution. "Following a hearing by the president’s Patient Resource Efficiency Board (PREB), 86-year-old Dorothy Zborknak has been ordered to death. The reason? According to the administration, she is no longer useful. "Zborknak worked at Fleur de Lis Florist in Chicago for nearly forty years, before she made the decision to retire in 1998. Since that time, she has struggled with a host of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney failure. " ‘Unfortunately, the cost of her care just became too expensive,’ claims Peter Johnston, a member of the Chicago PREB. ‘Under the Affordable Care Act, we have the power to make choices about end of life care and I stand by our ruling. I know it will be hard for the family to accept what’s going to happen…But from a financial standpoint, this was a very easy decision.’ We’ll offer a quick diagnosis: This claim is not accurate. Back in 2009, the myth of death panels was our inaugural Lie of the Year. Almost five years later, death panels are still not a part of U.S. health care law. Our first clue that the American News article was not real was the name of the woman who was supposedly sentenced to execution: Dorothy Zborknak. That’s the name of Bea Arthur’s character on the TV show The Golden Girls. (Slightly misspelled -- it's actually Zbornak.) It turns out that the story is ripped from an article posted on The Daily Currant in January. The Daily Currant is a satirical website with a mission "to ridicule the timid ignorance which obstructs our progress and promote intelligence," according to the website. Other headlines include things like "Obama Announces Two-Year Golfing Trip" and "Al-Qaeda Member Elected to California City Council." The debunkers at Snopes.com caught this case of copying back in September. As for the American News site, its "About Us" and "Privacy Policy" pages have no information on them besides ads. Stories are posted without attribution or bylines. We attempted to contact them through a form on the site, but did not receive a response. The article was posted on The Patriot Facebook page in September and quickly spread. It has 6,019 likes and was shared 4,906 times. For those who don’t recall it, the death panel discussion stemmed from a post on former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin’s Facebook page on August 7, 2009. "The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society,’ whether they are worthy of health care," she wrote. There is no mention of such a system in the massive Affordable Care Act. Instead, the idea originated from changes to Medicare to cover appointments on end-of-life planning, such as living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. The appointments were not required, and AARP backed the addition. The change wasn’t implemented after the controversy over Palin’s comments. Our ruling The chain email claimed that Dorothy Zborknak was ordered executed by an Obamacare death panel. We ruled on this topic five years ago, but we’ll repeat it again: Death squads are not a part of the Affordable Care Act, and you can still catch Dorothy on Golden Girls reruns most nights.

pomt-04361	"A few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/22/barack-obama/obama-romney-called-russia-our-top-geopolitical-fo/	Correction: At PolitiFact, we say words matter. So when we get the words wrong, it stings. At Monday’s presidential debate, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama got into a back-and-forth over whether Romney called Russia America’s No. 1 "geopolitical threat." But we fact-checked something different, whether Romney said Russia was America’s No. 1 "geopolitical foe." We mischaracterized the president’s remarks, which affected our ruling. We have updated the item with the exact quote and changed our ruling accordingly. In the final debate of the presidential campaign, President Barack Obama tried to portray challenger Mitt Romney as a novice who lacks understanding of complex world issues. "Gov. Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaida. You said Russia ... the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years," Obama said. We’ve heard the president make that charge about Russia before, using similar words. Here’s what we found. The hot mic In March 2012, at a summit in South Korea, Obama was caught in a "hot mic" incident. Without realizing he could be overheard, Obama told Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more ability to negotiate with the Russians about missile defense after the November election. "On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved, but it’s important for him to give me space," Obama was heard telling Medvedev, apparently referring to incoming Russian president Vladi­mir Putin. "Yeah, I understand," Medvedev replied. Obama interjected, saying, "This is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility." The exchange drew swift rebuke from Republicans, who accused Obama of caving on an important security issue. Romney quickly joined the chorus of critics. In a March 26 interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, he said the president seemed to be willing to negotiate with Russians on matters he was hiding from the American people. Said Romney: "This is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe. They fight for every cause for the world's worst actors. The idea that he has more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling indeed." Blitzer asked Romney if he thought Russia is a bigger foe than Iran, China or North Korea. "I'm saying in terms of a geopolitical opponent, the nation that lines up with the world's worst actors," Romney said. "Of course the greatest threat that the world faces is a nuclear Iran, and a nuclear North Korea is already troubling enough. But when these terrible actors pursue their course in the world and we go to the United Nations looking for ways to stop them ... who is it that always stands up with the world's worst actors? It's always Russia, typically with China alongside. And so in terms of a geopolitical foe, a nation that's on the Security Council that has the heft of the Security Council, and is of course is a massive nuclear power, Russia is the geopolitical foe." The op-ed Romney followed that interview a day later with an op-ed in Foreign Policy magazine. In that piece, he never used the word "enemy" or "foe" to describe Russia. But he did depict it as an adversary and referred to its "intransigence." "Without extracting meaningful concessions from Russia, (Obama) abandoned our missile defense sites in Poland. He granted Russia new limits on our nuclear arsenal. He capitulated to Russia's demand that a United Nations resolution on the Iranian nuclear-weapons program exclude crippling sanctions," Romney wrote. "Moscow has rewarded these gifts with nothing but obstructionism at the United Nations on a whole raft of issues. It has continued to arm the regime of Syria's vicious dictator and blocked multilateral efforts to stop the ongoing carnage there. Across the board, it has been a thorn in our side on questions vital to America's national security. For three years, the sum total of President Obama's policy toward Russia has been: ‘We give, Russia gets.’" Later, on a multi-nation trip in July designed to beef up his foreign policy credentials, Romney condemned Russia as a "country where the desire to be free is met with brutal oppression." The second interview Romney spoke again to CNN’s Blitzer in July. Romney’s campaign previously pointed us to this exchange: Blitzer: "The last time you and I spoke in an interview, you told me that Russia was America’s No. 1 geostrategic foe. Do you still believe that?" Romney: "There's no question but that in terms of geopolitics -- I’m talking about votes at the United Nations and actions of a geopolitical nature -- Russia is the No. 1 adversary in that regard. That doesn't make them an enemy. It doesn’t make them a combatant. They don't represent the No. 1 national security threat. The No. 1 national security threat, of course, to our nation is a nuclear Iran. Time continues to pass. They continue to move towards nuclearization. This is more and more disconcerting and dangerous to the world. But Russia -- particularly look at a place like Syria. Russia has supported the Assad regime even as it has been attacking its own people. Russia likewise has been slow to move to the kinds of sanctions that have been called for in Iran. Russia is a geopolitical adversary, but it's not an enemy with, you know, missiles being fired at one another or things of that nature." So in this interview, as he would do later in the debate, Romney emphasized the difference between Russia, his No. 1 foe or enemy for the United States, and Iran, his No. 1 threat because of its effort to build nuclear weapons. Romney responds in the debate After a few minutes of back and forth, Romney had a chance to respond to Obama’s charge about Russia: "I'll respond to a couple of things that you mentioned. First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe. Not ... Excuse me. It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face. Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again. I have clear eyes on this. I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin. And I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election. So Romney revised his own remarks, this time calling Russia "a" geopolitical foe, when to CNN he said "our No. 1 geopolitical foe." But he’s right that in the same interview he called Iran the top national security threat. Our ruling In the debate, Obama said Romney called Russia "the biggest geopolitical threat facing America." Actually, Romney has twice drawn the distinction between his concerns about Iran and Russia. He has called Russia the biggest geopolitical foe or enemy for the U.S., but he has said the biggest threat is Iran. We rate Obama’s statement Half True.

pomt-01351	The Affordable Care Act says that "at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. … Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/21/chain-email/five-years-chain-email-about-cancer-treatment-rati/	A reader recently sent us a years-old chain email that has morphed into something more timely. It now has the heading, "IMPORTANT ACTION INFORMATION FOR NOVEMBER, 2014 VOTE." For years before that, though, the chain email has floated around the Internet, making the scary claim that "at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age." PolitiFact Oregon gave this a rating of Pants on Fire when they looked at it in 2013. The email -- which has changed somewhat as it has zigzagged around social media -- can be identified by its attribution of the information to Judge David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas. (More on him later.) It opens with a dire warning: "MEDICARE AT AGE 76, IMPORTANT PLEASE READ - ANYONE WHO DOUBTS THIS IS TRUE CAN DOWNLOAD THE NEW OBAMA CARE AND LOOK UP THE PAGES MENTIONED. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING......THIS should be read by everyone, especially important to those over 75..... If you are younger, then it may apply to your parents…." However, the email is hardly up-to-date -- it’s been circulating since 2009 and apparently stems from a list of tweets by blogger Peter Fleckenstein about H.R. 3200. That was an early version of the legislation that later became the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Many aspects of that original bill never made it into law, and other provisions have been misinterpreted or exaggerated by the email’s author. In fact, our friends at FactCheck.org found that just four of the email’s 48 claims were accurate. Here, we'll recap what we know about the cancer claim and a few of the email's other points. The cancer claim The email bases its claim about the age-based rationing of cancer care on page 272 of H.R. 3200, section 1145. But the claim is not correct. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010. It does not include rationing for cancer treatment based on age or any other demographic factor. Nor did the precursor bill, H.R. 3200, include a cut-off age for cancer treatments. One provision of H.R. 3200 did include a section on "treatment of certain cancer hospitals," but this simply allowed Medicare -- the federally run health plan for those older than 65 -- to allocate more funding to cancer hospitals if they incurred higher costs. The American Nurses Association called this the "opposite of rationing." Under current legislation, "all medically necessary treatment is covered by Medicare. Including cancer treatments, regardless of age," said Katherine Fitzpatrick of the Medicare Rights Center, an advocacy group, in a June 2013 interview. The Medicare Rights Center and AARP, the largest national organization of seniors, agree that hospital admittance has to do with billing under parts A or B of Medicare. Under the version of the Affordable Care Act that was adopted, Medicare payments to hospitals can be reduced if patients are readmitted within 30 days for certain conditions, such as pneumonia, but that’s not what the email claims. Meanwhile, the email raises a legitimate concern -- "rationing" -- but does so in a misleading way. "Everyone hates the word ‘rationing,’ " Harvard University health-policy specialist Katherine Baicker told PolitiFact in 2009. But rationing is not something that suddenly appeared in the Affordable Care Act, she added. "From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything." It’s theoretically possible to spend an unlimited amount on health care, but as a society, we only have a limited amount of public resources -- so tough decisions have to be made on how to allocate those resources. Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, "rationing" occurred when private insurers denied coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, or denied reimbursement for certain basic services, or priced their plans too high for certain consumers to pay. If anything, John F. Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center, said in an earlier interview that private insurers are historically more likely to deny health services than Medicare is. "That's the argument you hear people making," he said. "But I think they have it backwards." A final word. Remember Judge Kithil, the supposed author of the email? He’s disowned it. "I wish it would die. I can’t control it," David Kithil told PolitiFact Oregon in 2013. "I don’t know how something like that goes viral." The former judge recalled that he wrote a letter to his local newspaper in 2009, protesting the initial version of the health care act. The letter was published in the River Cities Daily Tribune, circulation 5,000. Somehow, he said, it was republished online. Kithil said he wants readers to disregard his letter, since it is outdated and based on legislation that did not become law. "I’ve had calls from all over the country -- 300 to 400 calls over three or four years on this," he said at the time. He said he pleads with the callers, "Don’t pass it on. It’s not accurate anymore. Trash it." Our ruling The chain email says that the Affordable Care Act requires that, "at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. … Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age." With this email, longevity has not meant accuracy: Seniors do not need to worry about their cancer care being yanked away once they reach age 76. The claims are based on an incorrect understanding of a bill that never passed. The Affordable Care Act does not include any sections on seniors losing their treatment eligibility once they reach age 76. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-10607	"I know that Hillary on occasion has said — just last year said this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/22/barack-obama/no-evidence-she-said-that/	Trying to depict Hillary Clinton as a flip-flopper on trade, Barack Obama claimed the New York senator considered the North American Free Trade Agreement a plus for the economy, even though she's recently criticized the pact on the campaign trail. "I know that Hillary on occasion has said — just last year said this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy," Obama said during a Jan. 21, 2008, debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. "I think it has been devastating, because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the U.S. were getting a square deal." Obama's charge is designed to stoke suspicions among liberals and labor leaders that Clinton is in the thrall of big business Democrats who served in her husband's administration, such as former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, chairman of Citigroup Inc., and ex-Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, her top economic adviser. Clinton, indeed, energetically promoted NAFTA in the past, thanking corporations for furthering its goals during an address to the 1998 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and adding, "It is certainly clear that we have not by any means finished the job that has begun." But even before she formally announced her candidacy, Clinton was expressing increased skepticism about globalization and questioning whether other nations were taking advantage of the United States' liberalized trade policies. The critical tone intensified during the run-up to the Iowa caucuses. During an Oct. 8, 2007, speech in Iowa, she complained that New York apple growers had failed to gain access to Canadian markets while Canadian growers were having no such problems exporting their products to the United States, and blamed the Bush administration for not vigorously enforcing trade agreements. "I think it is time that we assess trade agreements every five years to make sure they're meeting their goals or make adjustments if they are not and we should start with doing that with NAFTA," Clinton said. The line attributed to Clinton about NAFTA being a "boon" to the economy appears to be based on an issues rundown in the Sept. 11, 2006, edition of Newsday in which the Long Island newspaper, in its own words, stated that Clinton believed the trade agreement to be a boon to the economy. The paper also pointed out that Clinton voted against the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement in 2005 because of concerns that it would drive jobs overseas. Since announcing her candidacy, Clinton has, in fact, tried to distance herself from some of the free-trade policies her husband's administration pursued and repeatedly expressed concern and skepticism about the benefits of globalization. In June 2007, she said NAFTA had some positive effects "but unfortunately it had a lot of downside." And at a debate in December 2007, she announced her intention to review and reform NAFTA if she were elected. Obama implies Clinton views NAFTA as an unqualified success, but more importantly, he attributes words to her that only appear in a newspaper summary of the issues. We judge his statement to be False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-01-22T00:00:00	2008-01-21	['North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-03184	Congress secured special Obamacare rules "to prevent their healthcare costs from rising."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/03/karen-handel/handels-diagnoses-obamacare-rule-bad-legislation/	U.S. Senate candidate Karen Handel recently highlighted an example of what she considers hypocrisy in the place where she wants to work. Handel fired off a couple of emails to supporters attacking two can’t-lose sources of Republican consternation -- Obamacare and Congress. "Only in Washington could Congress seek and secure a special exception to prevent their health care costs from rising while premiums for thousands of Georgians will go up by as much as 198 percent next year," one email read. Another email read: "Last week, Karen asked Congressmen Jack Kingston, Paul Broun and Phil Gingrey to join her in standing against the special Obamacare exemption negotiated by members of Congress in order to prevent their healthcare premiums from rising. We still haven't heard a peep." PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state and former candidate for governor, accurately depicted the situation. Did Congress negotiate a special exception or exemption for itself and its staff to prevent their health care premiums from rising? Broun, Gingrey and Kingston, like Handel, are vying for the Republican Party nomination for the Senate. The three U.S. House members have been vocal opponents of the federal health care law, aka Obamacare, which was passed along partisan lines in 2010. The three men have repeatedly voted to repeal it. But those measures have not gotten past the Senate. Handel, who has never run for Congress, has fashioned herself as the only candidate in the crowded field who can shake up Washington and restore some conservative normalcy to Capitol Hill. When Congress passed the health care law, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, included an amendment that required lawmakers and their staffs to buy health insurance through the online exchanges created by the law. Grassley’s amendment was intended to test the commitment of Senate Democrats to the health care law. Would they be as supportive of the law if they had to buy insurance through an exchange? The amendment stayed. The health care law created exchanges for people to buy insurance. A state can create and run its own exchange, it can operate an exchange with the federal government or allow Uncle Sam to handle it. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, like many Republican governors, decided the state should not participate in the exchange program. Members of Congress and their staffs still must obtain coverage from health plans created under Obamacare or through an exchange. In late April, Twitter was atwitter with reports that Congress was negotiating a deal with the Obama administration to exempt itself from the health care law. Not so, Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein explained in April. "[N]o one is discussing ‘exempting’ congressional staffers from Obamacare," he reported. "They’re discussing creating some method through which the federal government can keep making its current contribution to the health insurance of congressional staffers." On Aug. 7, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that members of Congress and some of their staffs will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums. A news release does not mention congressional involvement in the decision. So was Handel wrong about the role of Congress in the arrangement? Far from it, said Handel spokesman Dan McLagan, who sent us several news reports to back up his claim. Reuters reported that House and Senate leaders had been in intense negotiations with the Obama administration to reach an agreement about employer contributions. The Wall Street Journal reported that President Barack Obama told congressional Democrats in a closed-door meeting that he would resolve the matter. Some members of Congress were reportedly worried some of their employees would quit if something wasn’t done. A "brain drain" is what they called it. McLagan also forwarded us a news release from U.S. Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, that says congressional leaders were part of the decision. Vitter was not happy about the OPM rule. "[T]his behind-closed-doors deal, announced right after Congress is safely away from the crime scene on break, was fully supported by establishment Republicans," Vitter said. "When it comes to protecting their own, they find a way to work just beautifully with the Democrats." PolitiFact Georgia still wondered whether it was correct for Handel’s emails to label the OPM rule as an exemption or an exception? We asked the OPM, and an official there responded by sending us the news release, which contained links to a fact sheet about its plans and other information. In the news release, the OPM said the amount of the employer contribution toward exchange premiums is no more than would otherwise be made toward coverage under the prior health benefits program for members of Congress and eligible staff. McLagan and many conservatives, though, believe this is part of a special exemption for Congress and its staff. McLagan said the health care law did not provide for a continued taxpayer subsidy of health care costs for members of Congress and their staffs. "This is clearly an exemption. It was done by an administration desperate to keep support of the president's only memorable legislative accomplishment from falling apart. They found a way to exempt Congress from the law. You can call it ‘purple unicorns’ or ‘continuation of purple unicorns’ if you like, but you cannot say that Karen's characterization was inaccurate," McLagan said. U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, a Republican from Coweta County, recently wrote an op-ed with his explanation of what happened. He said a technicality in the health care law ended employer contributions to lawmakers and their staffs, forcing them to pay 100 percent of their health care costs. "What OPM actually did was issue regulations stating the government can continue to make the employer contribution to the health plans of Members of Congress and their staff – exactly as they do right now," said the congressman, who is neither a fan of the decision nor the health care law. So where does this leave us? Handel said Congress negotiated itself a special rule to prevent its health care benefits from rising. She’s used the words "exception" and "exemption" to describe what happened. Congress, according to several news accounts and a GOP senator, was pushing to get this done, although it came from an order by the Obama administration. Most conservatives describe the decision as an exemption. The OPM says the rule is a continuation of past policies for funding health care coverage for congressional workers and their bosses. Handel’s basic claim seems to be in the ballpark. But it needs a lot of context to be fully understood. It’s true that members of Congress and some of their staffs will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums. But they will also still have to go through the health care exchanges like other people. We rate Handel’s claim Half True.

pomt-09969	The economic stimulus bill created a council that's "modeled after the national board that controls Britain’s health system."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/11/conservatives-patients-rights/health-board-stimulus-bill-not-meant-imitate-brita/	A television ad makes the argument that the United States is on the path to a nationalized health service similar to the United Kingdom's. The advocacy group Conservatives for Patients' Rights created the ad, which features the group's chairman, Rick Scott, talking about the economic stimulus bill that became law Feb. 17, 2009. Scott is a health care executive who founded Solantic, a chain of urgent care clinics in Florida. "Deep inside the stimulus bill Congress buried an innocent-sounding board, the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research," Scott says in the ad. "It's not so innocent. It's the first step in government control over your health care choices. This federal council is modeled after the national board that controls Britain's health system." The ad goes on to quote doctors who complain about lack of choice and long waiting times for care in the national health care systems of Britain and Canada. "Not only could a government board deny your choice in doctors but it can control life and death for some patients," Scott says. "Tell Congress you won't trade your doctor for a national board of bureaucrats. Let's put patients first," he concludes. The ad is correct that the stimulus bill includes language creating the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. But to say it's modeled after the British health system is wrong. The board is simply an effort to pull together disparate federal agencies to find the best health treatments. Comparative effectiveness research is an effort in health care to determine which treatments work best. The new board's goal, according to the bill's conference report, is to "reduce duplication of comparative effectiveness research activities within the federal government." The legislation requires that half of the board's 15 members be physicians or "other experts with clinical expertise." The legislation also specifically states it does not permit the board to "mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer" and that the none of the board's reports or recommendations "shall be construed as mandates or clinical guidelines for payment, coverage, or treatment." This stands in sharp contrast to the British system, where government entities run the health care system and a national board, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence, determines whether particular treatments are covered or not. In defending its ad, the group has said that its ad makes clear that the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research is simply a "first step" toward the British system. But that seems to be the group's opinion more than a fact. There are relatively few supporters for a government-run health care system in Congress, though Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, both Democrats, support similar models known as single-payer health systems. President Barack Obama has specifically rejected a government-run health care system in the style of Britain or Canada, even though some of his supporters have asked him to consider it as an option. He addressed the matter most directly during a town hall on March 26, 2009, where people submitted questions via the Internet, including, "Why can we not have a universal health care system, like many European countries, where people are treated based on needs rather than financial resources?" Obama said that the British and Canadian systems are too different from what exists in the United States, where the majority of people get health care coverage through their employers. (Read his extended answer via the White House transcript .) "I don't think the best way to fix our health care system is to suddenly completely scrap what everybody is accustomed to and the vast majority of people already have. Rather, what I think we should do is to build on the system that we have and fill some of these gaps," he concluded. He also added that he hoped to "lower costs through reforms in how we reimburse doctors so that they're not getting paid just for the number of operations they're doing, but for whether they're quality outcomes." That seems how a board like the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research would make an impact under Obama's plan. We can't say for sure, though, because Obama and Congress have yet to reveal the full details of health care reform. This is not to say that implementing comparative effectiveness research will be painless for the public, and Obama has admitted as much. In an interview with the New York Times on April 14, 2009, he discussed his grandmother's decision to get a hip replacement even though she had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and died soon after the replacement. "I would have paid out of pocket for that hip replacement just because she’s my grandmother," Obama said. "Whether, sort of in the aggregate, society making those decisions to give my grandmother, or everybody else’s aging grandparents or parents, a hip replacement when they’re terminally ill is a sustainable model, is a very difficult question." Obama added that answering tough questions on end-of-life care will "have to be a conversation that is guided by doctors, scientists, ethicists. And then there is going to have to be a very difficult democratic conversation that takes place. It is very difficult to imagine the country making those decisions just through the normal political channels. And that’s part of why you have to have some independent group that can give you guidance. It’s not determinative, but I think has to be able to give you some guidance." Getting back to the ad: It is right that the economic stimulus bill created the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. But the ad is wrong that it is "modeled after the national board that controls Britain’s health system." We see no evidence for that. In fact, the president has specifically rejected the British model, while praising comparative effectiveness research as an acceptable way to rein in spending. Because the ad significantly distorts the reason for the board's existence, we rate its claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Conservatives for Patients' Rights	None	None	None	2009-05-11T19:09:35	2009-04-27	['United_Kingdom']
pomt-14634	Donald Trump’s decision to skip the Fox News/Google debate in Des Moines "is near unprecedented."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/jan/28/fox-news-channel/how-often-do-presidential-candidates-skip-debates-/	Donald Trump says he will sit out Thursday’s presidential debate after clashing with Fox News over the network’s inclusion of Megyn Kelly as a moderator. Trump’s beef with Kelly started in the first GOP debate last August, when the Fox anchor questioned him on his remarks about women. The Trump campaign demanded Kelly’s removal from the Jan. 28 debate, but the network refused, inciting the billionaire’s ire and a boycott. In response, the network wrote in an official statement: "Donald Trump is refusing to debate seven of his fellow presidential candidates on stage that night, which is near unprecedented. "We’re not sure how Iowans are going to feel about him walking away from them at the last minute, but it should be clear to the American public by now that this is rooted in one thing – Megyn Kelly, whom he has viciously attacked since August and has now spent four days demanding be removed from the debate stage. Capitulating to politicians’ ultimatums about a debate moderator violates all journalistic standards, as do threats, including the one leveled by Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski toward Megyn Kelly." We were curious about Fox’s assertion that Trump’s decision is "near unprecedented." We didn’t hear back from the network, but our research finds Fox’s claim is slightly exaggerated. Many other candidates on both sides of the aisle have ditched debate, but the clearest connection to Trump happened more than 35 years ago, when then-frontrunner Ronald Reagan skipped the final debate before the Iowa caucus in 1980. Let’s go through some examples of candidates passing up the chance to debate, tracing back from the cycle we’re in now. 2016 cycle Trump’s Fox News debate boycott marks the third time Trump has threatened to pull out of a debate (though he has showed up to all of them so far). But Trump isn’t the only candidate who’s toyed with the idea, and one candidate actually beat Trump to it. After failing to qualify for the main debate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul skipped the undercard round hosted by Fox Business News and Facebook on Jan. 16. "I won’t participate in anything that’s not first-tier because we have a first-tier campaign," Paul said. Paul’s self-extraction from the earlier debate isn’t quite the same thing as Trump, the front runner, pulling out of the prime time event in Iowa days before the Iowa caucuses. But Paul isn’t the only other example, and Trump isn’t the only leading candidate to have refused to debate. 2012 cycle There were 20 GOP primary debates in 2012. (The Democrats did not have any, given President Barack Obama’s incumbency.) Eventual Republican nominee Mitt Romney was invited to the first Republican debate on May 5, 2011, before he announced his candidacy, but Romney opted out. Similarly, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman declined an invitation for the second debate held June 13, 2011, by CNN and announced his candidacy the following day. Huntsman then skipped another CNN debate to attend a town hall forum instead. Five out of seven Republican candidates (Romney, Huntsman, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Rep. Ron Paul) bowed out of a Newsmax debate scheduled for Dec. 27, 2011, — with Trump as the moderator. While the others cited conflicting schedules or didn’t say why they were declining, the Ron Paul campaign specifically named Trump himself as the reason, saying, "Mr. Trump’s participation will contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere." Only former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Kentucky Sen. Rick Santorum accepted the invitation. The debate was cancelled after Trump withdrew from moderating. (Trump took to Twitter to air his grievances.) 2008 cycle In 2008, four leading Republican candidates — Arizona Sen. John McCain, Romney, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson — skipped a primary debate held Sept. 27, 2007, by PBS, citing conflicting schedules. A few months later, Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., boycotted a Univision debate because "a Spanish debate has no place in a presidential campaign," he said. In the Democratic primary, Obama, then a U.S. senator from Illinois, Hillary Clinton, then a U.S. senator from New York, and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards declined to participate in a Sept. 23, 2007, debate hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus and Fox News. The three said they would participate in a CNN debate co-sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus instead, with an Obama spokesman noting that "CNN seemed like a more appropriate venue." The debate was canceled. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson did not participate in a radio-only debate hosted by NPR in December 2007 in order to attend the funeral of a Korean war veteran. Previous elections Beyond the more recent cycles, there are even more examples of major candidates declining to debate in both primary and general elections. "It’s not unprecedented for frontrunners to skip out in primary debates," said Mitchell McKinney, a University of Missouri professor of political communication who specializes in presidential debates. McKinney gave a few other examples of no-shows. In 1980, Ronald Reagan passed on the last debate before the Iowa caucus, thinking he had the state in the bag. However, he lost the caucus to George H.W. Bush, who had a strong performance. In 1996, Bob Dole skipped the first primary debate in order to campaign. And in 1999, then Texas Gov. George W. Bush was absent for the first two primary debates. (He had planned to skip all the debates until January 2000 but began participating in December due to falling poll numbers and pressure from the party, according to USA Today.) Even further back, there’s also Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (who refused to debate Barry Goldwater in 1964) and Richard Nixon (who, after debating and losing to John F. Kennedy in 1960, opted out in 1968 and 1972), according to Ohio University’s William Benoit, who’s authored several books on presidential debates. To debate or not to debate So Trump’s decision to skip the Fox News debate, while rare, isn’t unique. And what’s more, experts said, bowing out is an old strategy for moving forward. "Candidates who lead may not want to risk making a blunder in the debate," Benoit said. "Occasionally a candidate in the primary will skip a debate; for example a candidate who knows he or she will lose in Iowa might skip one or more Iowa debates to concentrate on New Hampshire." Unlike other candidates who choose not to participate, Kinney argues, Trump doesn’t have to fear losing exposure (given his knack for garnering media attention) or being accused of weakness (given his blustery, aggressive brand). "This Megyn Kelly (spat) has obviously been ongoing, but honestly it could be cover," he said. "To use that to dodge attacks from anyone else on that stage — since frontrunners are in line of fire — it’s pretty smart." Our ruling Fox News said Donald Trump’s decision to skip its upcoming debate in Des Moines "is near unprecedented." Fox takes its claim a bit too far, as we found many examples in recent cycles of candidates skipping primary debates and in some cases even sitting out debate for a year at a time. The clearest comparison to Trump happened with Reagan about 35 years ago. However, the news channel has a point that the Trump situation is pretty uncommon. We rate Fox’s claim Half True.

pomt-09709	Three presidents in the last century — Harding, Kennedy and Reagan — all cut taxes during recessions and produced "rapid and dramatic economic recoveries," while two, Herbert Hoover and Barack Obama, did "the opposite."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/02/tom-mcclintock/california-republican-lumps-obama-hoover-his-appro/	President Barack Obama has been in office for just 10 months, but already he's being measured against his predecessors in the Oval Office. In a House floor speech on Oct. 27, 2009, Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., said Obama and Herbert Hoover were ineffective at dealing with recessions. "Three presidents within the last 100 years have responded to recessions by reducing taxes and regulations," McClintock said. "Warren Harding, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan all produced rapid and dramatic economic recoveries. We’ve had two presidents in those 100 years who reacted to recessions by doing the opposite — Herbert Hoover in the early 1930s, who radically increased taxes and spending and who imposed unprecedented burdens on trade, and the other is Barack Obama." We contacted a host of presidential historians and economists to see whether they agreed with McClintock. First, let's discuss where the experts generally agree that McClintock is right. Harding, Kennedy and Reagan each acted to lower taxes, and in fact each of them staked some political capital on it. (Technically, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, brought the tax cut to fruition after Kennedy's assassination.) Each of these presidents either inherited a recession upon entering office or saw one emerge early in their first term. Meanwhile, Hoover did indeed hike taxes and spending during his tenure, and he signed the Smoot-Hawley Tarriff Act of 1930, which raised tarriffs on thousands of goods to record levels. Two of those we spoke to -- David Boaz of the Cato Institute and Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute -- were generally favorable toward McClintock's comments. But other scholars we spoke to saw a number of failings in McClintock's thesis. 1. McClintock's list of recessions is selective, in a way that favors Republicans . A look at the official list of recessions compiled by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that McClintock ignores a number of downturns that occurred under Republican presidents — including Dwight Eisenhower (1953, 1957-58), Richard Nixon (1969-70, 1973-75), George H.W. Bush (1990-91) and George W. Bush (2001) — while ignoring recoveries under Democratic President Harry Truman (1945, 1949). 2. Recessions stem from a number of causes . Sometimes they are caused by factors internal to the economy (such a downturn in the business cycle) and sometimes they are prompted by an external development (such as oil shocks in the 1970s or the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks). Because these recessions have different origins, economists say, no single policy prescription works for all of them. This suggests that McClintock is oversimplifying matters. 3. McClintock distorts Hoover's tax record . Hoover is widely blamed for worsening the economy by signing the Smoot-Hawley law. But that was a tariff; Hoover's record on taxes is more complicated. He did sign the Revenue Act of 1932, which more than doubled the top income tax rate and probably worsened the nation's already dire economic situation. But that law came three years after the Depression began, so for the first three years of his tenure, the economic outlook worsened without any assistance from a tax hike. Indeed, the tax laws then in force were initiated by steep tax cuts urged by long-serving Republican Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon and enacted under Hoover's predecessors, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge — not necessarily a winning argument in favor of low taxation. Finally, Hoover did in one instance reduce taxes rather than raise them: He signed a joint congressional resolution that cut taxes by 1 percentage point on Dec. 16, 1929, shortly after the stock market crash of 1929. 4. The Reagan recovery may have been dramatic, but it was anything but "rapid." The second dip of the "double-dip" recession of the early 1980s — which occurred entirely on Reagan's watch — lasted 16 months from peak to trough. That made it the longest recession between the Great Depression and today's "Great Recession." 5. Focusing on the presidential role in combating recessions ignores other important factors . Something McClintock's formulation ignores is the enormous role of the Federal Reserve in leveraging monetary policy to fight recessions. For instance, many give Fed Chairman Paul Volcker significant credit for the 1980s recovery, due to his leadership (supported by Reagan) in lowering double-digit inflation. Meanwhile, some argue that, before the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt, federal revenues and spending were so small as a percentage of the nation's economy that presidents had only weak levers to work with as they tried to fight economic downturns. Finally, actions of the 50 state governments can have major effects on the economy, yet cuts at the federal level often prompt spending increases at the state and local level, complicating the influence that government has on the economy. 6. The Obama record isn't settled yet . So far at least, Obama hasn't raised taxes; he's actually cut certain taxes, totaling $288 billion for individuals and companies, as part of his economic stimulus package. It's true that passage of health care reform would involve raising taxes, and passage of a "cap-and-trade" climate-change plan would represent an increase in regulation. But both initiatives are staunchly opposed by Republicans and there's no guarantee they'll be enacted, or, if they are, what their provisions will be. 7. Finally, correlation does not mean causation . Even if tax cuts happened to coincide with recoveries and tax hikes tended to coincide with recessions, it doesn't necessarily mean that one causes the other. For instance, tax cuts and deregulation likely aided the Reagan recovery (as did Volcker's inflation-fighting efforts) but historians say that higher defense spending, another Reagan priority, also helped bring the United States out of recession, as did historically lower oil prices. Meanwhile, Kennedy, in addition to cutting taxes, supported major increases in public works spending, not least the space program. The implementation of so many policies at the same time makes it hard to credit just one or two with launching a recovery. When we showed the criticisms we heard to McClintock's office, he responded with a detailed critique, which we encourage readers to visit here . He made a valid point about the recession and recovery under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, which this story now reflects. But overall, he did not persuade us that the 12-plus experts we consulted were wrong. We will readily acknowledge that it's impossible to encapsulate a century of American political and economic history into three sentences, so some oversimplification is inevitable. And McClintock did get several key facts in his statement correct. Still, most of the dozen-plus scholars we contacted agreed that the congressman greatly oversimplified matters, and we feel that describing history this way will leave an incorrect impression. So we rate McClintock's claim False.	None	Tom McClintock	None	None	None	2009-11-02T18:37:22	2009-10-27	['Herbert_Hoover', 'Ronald_Reagan', 'Warren_G._Harding', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-11213	Says the 2018 defense authorization bill includes raises for the military "for the first time in 10 years."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/10/donald-trump/did-donald-trump-sign-first-military-pay-raise-10-/	President Donald Trump opened up the White House for a celebration of military mothers and spouses. At the May 9 gathering, Trump signed an executive order to increase federal-agency hiring of military spouses. However, Trump errred in his remarks about an issue dear to the families in the attendance — military pay. Trump brought up his role earlier this year in signing the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018, the typical legislative vehicle for providing pay increases for the military. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "We just approved $700 billion for our military," Trump said. "So we’re going to be having the best equipment ever known. And next year, $716 billion. So I wanted to let you know. And, by the way — I know you don’t care about this — but that also includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years." That’s flat wrong. In fact, the last time that service members didn’t receive an annual pay increase was in 1983. And that was only because of a one-time technical quirk. Trump was "totally incorrect," said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "The military has gotten a pay raise each and every year." The full historical rundown is available in Table 5-12 here. We summarized those figures in this chart: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The increase of 2.4 percent in 2018 represented the biggest bump since 2010. But there have been increases every year since then, ranging from 1 percent to 2.1 percent. For 2019, the White House is proposing a 2.6 percent increase; the bill to enact that pay raise is working its way through Congress. So how about that missing increase in 1983? That was the year Congress began starting pay raises on Jan. 1 of the new year, rather than the first day of the government’s fiscal year in October. So service members received their pay at the start of the fiscal year a few months earlier, just not during the calendar year, Harrison said. Beyond that, you have to go back to 1961 to find a calendar year without a military pay increase. Our ruling Trump said that recent legislation "includes raises for our military. First time in 10 years." That’s wrong. Depending how you count it, the most recent year without a military pay raise was either 35 or 57 years ago — not 10. And the most recent pay raise wasn’t even the biggest in the past 10 years; it was exceeded by raises in 2008, 2009 and 2010, during the Bush and Obama administrations.

pomt-15167	"Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college."	false	/florida/statements/2015/aug/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-no-gop-candidate-has-talked-a/	Hillary Clinton is contrasting her plan to overhaul federal assistance for tuition at public colleges with her potential GOP rivals by saying Republicans haven’t even considered the issue. "Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college," said in an Aug. 23, 2015, tweet. "Disappointing, but not surprising." What is a little surprising to PolitiFact Florida is that Clinton’s tweet omits at least one candidate who has made college costs a major platform plank — the Sunshine State’s Sen. Marco Rubio. Rubio said as much by tweeting back the same day, saying Clinton "can't lecture me on student loans. I've had student loans & I have a plan to modernize higher ed." He then linked to a statement on his website excoriating Clinton for planning to put tax dollars into an "outdated system." Clinton’s own idea is a 10-year, $350 billion plan called the "New College Compact." Clinton proposed in August to allow students to attend public colleges without taking out loans to pay tuition. Families would be required to contribute and federal spending would be expanded, but with controls on spending by colleges and universities. Clinton’s campaign has not offered many details beyond the price tag and told PolitiFact Florida they had nothing to add to her tweet. Rubio has been talking about the issue since at least February 2014, when he made a major policy speech about controlling crippling college debt. He repeated his positions in a July speech after he declared his candidacy. His plan includes several specific ideas: Establishing a new accreditation process for nontraditional education. Rubio has not said what these "innovative, low-cost competitors" are, but they are generally considered to be for-profit universities, online courses and others. Requiring schools to tell students what kind of salary they can expect to earn with every degree. Basing loan repayment plans on the amount of money a graduate makes annually. Allow student investment plans, in which investors would pay for a student’s tuition in exchange for a percentage of their post-graduation income for a number of years, whether that covers the investment or not. Expanding apprenticeship and vocational programs for students who don’t want or need to go to a tradition two- or four-year college. Some other candidates have also brought up tuition increases, student debt and federal spending on higher education. In June, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie laid out several ideas for reforming post-secondary education with an eye on reining in costs. Christie suggested itemized tuition bills that detailed what the money was paying for; allowing students to pay just for classes and not facilities or add-ons; and letting students obtain private financing for college with an option to pay it back with a percentage of earnings after graduation. He also floated ideas of providing tax credits for apprenticeship programs and for donating to debt reduction organizations that help students pay for schooling in exchange for community service. Carly Fiorina, the former technology executive, said in a July Q&A on Breitbart.com that student debt was out of control because "the federal government under Democrats has nationalized the student loan business." She suggested letting private banks compete for student loans. She also said the accreditation process should allow for more for-profit universities and online courses. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said in April 2015 he thought college tuition should be tax deductible, although he did not offer specifics of how that plan should work. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush earlier in August sparred with Clinton on Twitter about tuition, while Ben Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon, in February wrote a Washington Times editorial suggesting needy people should get jobs if they require help paying for college. Other candidates have been even less vocal on the subject, saying simply that college costs are a problem that have been dealt with, or nothing at all. Our ruling Clinton said, "Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college." While some Republican hopefuls haven’t had much to say on the issue, it’s not accurate to say none of them have. Rubio has made higher education spending a major plank of his campaign, and other candidates like Christie and Fiorina have set forth ideas and positions. Other candidates have at least mentioned the subject at times. We rate Clinton’s statement False.

pomt-09774	"House Republicans pledged to introduce a bill to reform America’s health care system," but "the 'party of no' has . . . failed to produce legislation."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/28/steny-hoyer/hoyer-claims-republicans-have-no-health-care-alter/	No matter which party controls Congress, its leaders usually refer to the opposition as "the party of no." The Republicans did it when they were in control, and now it's Democrats' turn. The latest complaint from House Democratic leaders is that Republicans have failed to produce an alternative to the five major health care bills circulating in Congress. In a Sept. 28, 2009, news release, Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer made this claim: "In June, House Republicans pledged to introduce a bill to reform America’s health care system. Now, over 100 days and numerous excuses later, the 'Party of no' has not only failed to produce legislation, but they have yet to offer any real solutions or ideas on how to make health care more affordable and accessible to American families." It's a matter of opinion whether Republicans have offered any "real solutions." But we can fact-check whether the GOP has, indeed, failed to introduce an alternative. Back in June, when the health care debate was just starting to heat up, Republicans were quick to say they wanted to be involved. Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio said there would be a Republican alternative, one that he said would make health care affordable for everyone; protect people from "being forced into a new government-run health care plan"; let people keep their doctors and their coverage; ensure that medical decisions are made by doctors; and improve health through prevention and disease management programs. "We believe our plan is a big improvement on the current system that will cost far less than what the administration is proposing," said Boehner. Republican Roy Blunt of Missouri, who is leading the GOP's Health Care Solutions Group, pledged his party would offer a bill based on those principles soon enough. "I guarantee you we will provide you with a bill that costs less and provides better care for the American people,” he said. Let's pause for a moment to explain some important Washington parlance. On Capitol Hill, many lawmakers present "plans" or "blueprints." Think of them as a rough draft for an eventual bill. Actually writing a bill is a slightly bigger step, although thousands of bills get introduced every year that never see the light of day — let alone the lights of a committee hearing. In that regard, Republicans have been prolific. Since the beginning of the year, they have introduced more than 35 health care reform bills. Many deal with small slices of the health care debate. For example, one, by Rep. Sam Johnson of Texas, would allow small businesses to band together to negotiate health care plans with providers. Another, by Rep. Darrell Issa of California, would allow nonfederal employees to enroll in the same health care plan that is currently enjoyed by members of Congress and federal employees. One bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the leader of the conservative Republican Study Committee, got our attention because it has 44 co-sponsors and tackles many of the goals the GOP leadership outlined early in the summer. The Empowering Patients First Act, would, for example, allow patients to keep their coverage, as Republicans vowed. But neither that bill nor the others from Republicans has emerged as the Republican alternative. That's partly because the Democrats are in control and have used their own bills as the main legislation, but also because no GOP bill has drawn enough support to get momentum. We asked Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman, whether Price's bill is the Republican-backed legislation that Blunt promised back in June. "It's an alternative," he said of the Price bill, pointing us to a Web site that lists several Republican health care bills. For now, there is no single Republican bill, Steel said. A single bill is exactly what the Democratic leadership is looking for, said Hoyer spokeswoman Stephanie Lundberg. "The RSC bill is not the Republican alternative," she said. "When we say that the Republicans don't have a bill, it's because they said they would have an alternative bill," backed by the party. So, back to Hoyer's claim. He contends that the Republicans "pledged to introduce a bill to reform America’s health care system" but have failed to do so. That's incorrect in that there are dozens of GOP bills, including several that are highlighted on the Republicans' Web site. But he's right that the Republicans have not rallied behind a single bill the way they suggested back in June. That leaves the Truth-O-Meter stuck in the middle. Half True.

pomt-13622	"The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/12/ron-johnson/no-climate-warming-quite-few-years-gop-sen-ron-joh/	On a Wisconsin radio talk show on Aug. 1, 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked about global warming. "Listen, man can affect the environment; no doubt about it," Johnson replied. "We all want a clean environment. It's a goal we all share. I understand that." Then the Republican incumbent, who faces Democrat Russ Feingold in the November 2016 election, made a statement we want to check, saying: "First of all, the climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically." Johnson’s comments on WRJN-AM in Racine prompted stories in the national media, including Talking Points Memo, Slate and the Huffington Post, each of which referred to 2015 being the hottest year on record. The rate of global warming has slowed in recent years, particularly since 1998, but Johnson’s declaration is, well, overheated. Johnson’s evidence To back Johnson’s statement, his campaign pointed us to a global "temperature anomaly" chart from NASA. A temperature anomaly means a change, up or down, from a long-term average. Source: NASA Johnson’s campaign argued that the chart shows the anomalies rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off. The trend on the chart, however, is steadily upward since the 1960s. And there was a "positive anomaly" in each of the past four years. Past fact checks Previous fact checks have found global temperatures hitting record highs in recent years. In 2013, when President Barack Obama said that "the 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years," PolitiFact National’s rating was True. And in 2014 and 2015, our colleagues rated Mostly False two claims that there had been no global warming in the past 17 years. Global surface temperatures remained relatively flat during that period, since the last powerful El Niño, in 1998. But the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been relatively stable -- has been the warmest on record. NASA/NOAA In January 2016, NASA reported that separate, independent analyses by its own scientists and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. The globally-averaged temperatures in 2015 "shattered the previous mark set in 2014," NASA said. The 2015 temperatures, NASA added, "continue a long-term warming trend" -- most of the warming has occurred in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring since 2001 (as is shown in the chart below). Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration So, the warmest year on record was 2015, followed by 2014. Moreover, Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist National Center for Atmospheric Research, told us that temperatures in the first six months of 2016 are even higher. Our rating Johnson said: "The climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically." He argues that temperatures rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off, but it’s wrong to say there hasn’t been warming in many years. In fact, 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001, with the two highest years being 2014 and 2015. We rate Johnson’s statement False.

pomt-13019	"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/06/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-tweet-air-force-one-bo/	President-elect Donald Trump tweeted criticism about Boeing, the lead contractor on the next generation of Air Force Ones, early in the morning on Dec. 6, 2016. Trump tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com He later elaborated to reporters staking out Trump Tower, "Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program. I think it's ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money." The political and defense worlds and the stock market immediately took note, since Boeing is a major American corporation that gets a lot of Pentagon money and employs significant numbers of manufacturing workers in high-wage jobs. When we looked into Trump’s tweet, we found that Trump’s description of the contract lacks some context. (His press office did not respond to an inquiry.) Some background on the Air Force One replacement project As the trade publication Defense One has noted, the two current Air Force Ones -- a modified version of a Boeing 747-200 aircraft known as VC-25 -- were purchased under President Ronald Reagan and were delivered in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush. With Boeing closing down its 747-200 production line 24 years ago, spare parts for the two current planes have become hard to find. And the plane is approaching the end of its expected 30-year life. So during his second term, President Barack Obama ordered a replacement fleet. (By tradition, a president does not order planes that he will expect to use personally.) Since the old model of the basic aircraft isn’t being made any longer, a new one had to be created. The new model will be based on the Boeing 747-8, with four engines and two floors. Trump’s tweet referenced one plane, but the Air Force One program will actually produce two planes, not one. That allows one to undergo maintenance while the other one is available. Of course, Air Force One is more than just a plane. It’s also a mobile command center, with state-of-the-art communications and safety features. The plane must be able to refuel while flying, and the president and his staff need to have communications capabilities equivalent to what is in the Oval Office -- secure video conferences, classified computer access, and nuclear-strike controls. It also needs robust defensive systems such as missile evasion. The new planes will be "both the fastest and longest commercial airliner in the world," according to military.com. They will be able to fly 7,730 nautical miles -- nearly 1,000 more than the current planes -- and will produce 16 tons less of carbon dioxide on a typical flight, according to the company. The extra features, obviously, do not come cheap. In fact, they comprise the bulk of the planes’ cost. Each basic plane costs about $380 million, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group Corporation, an aerospace and defense market analysis firm. Ultimately, Aboulafia said, the basic aircraft itself will account for just one-fifth of the entire project cost. How much will the project cost? The Air Force has published a budgetary document that says research, development, testing and evaluation of the new Air Force Ones -- officially known as the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization -- will cost $2.87 billion between fiscal years 2015 and 2021. However, the project is expected to extend beyond 2021, and experts told PolitiFact it would likely require another $1 billion in subsequent years to finish the job. The Teal Group has estimated that the project will require an additional $858 million between fiscal years 2022 and 2026. That adds up to a grand total of $3.73 billion over 12 years. That’s not "more than $4 billion," as Trump said, but it’s reasonably close -- and it’s no secret that defense contracts have a history of escalating in cost over time. Already, in response to inquiries from the media after Trump’s tweet, an Air Force spokesman told reporters to expect the interim $2.7 billion figure "to change as the program matures." So as a raw number, Trump’s $4 billion figure is in the ballpark. We should add that none of this price-tag includes operations and maintenance, such as aviation fuel, maintenance and pilot salaries. "Operations and maintenance are an inherent part of any such program," said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. "Canada was in line to buy the F-35, but then realized that they would actually had to operate the things, and they had sticker shock. Malaysia bought a bunch of MiG-29s without a service contract, to save money, and they soon turned into hangar queens." Such future costs would not involve Boeing, which is tasked with designing and building the planes, not operating them. What the tweet leaves out Clearly, $4 billion is a lot of money. But it’s important to keep some context in mind. First, it’s not clear that Boeing is behind any spiraling of costs; the demands of the project are dictated by the federal government. In addition, while Boeing is serving as the lead contractor on the project, much of the project’s costs are going for electronics and other items that Boeing itself does not produce. If costs on such items are going to go down, Boeing can’t do that directly. To cut such costs, "it is up to Boeing to jawbone their subcontractors," Pike said. Boeing offered some spin of its own in the statement it released after Trump’s tweet. In the statement, Boeing said: "We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer." By citing only the $170 million allocated to date, the company is ignoring the overwhelming majority of dollars for the project that the company expects to be paid in future years. Second, it’s important to note that the nearly $4 billion figure for the project as a whole is scheduled to be paid out over 12 years, not all at once. And in the context of the entire defense budget, that makes it a pretty small slice. The most recent presidential budget proposal shows defense spending between 2015 and 2026 equaling $8.132 trillion. So the Air Force One project amounts to four-one-hundredths of 1 percent of all defense spending over that 12-year time frame. It’s also a modest project within Boeing’s ledger of business. In 2015, Boeing had $96 billion in revenues. If one assumes the same revenues for all 12 years of the Air Force One project, then the project will account for three-tenths of 1 percent of the company’s overall revenues. Even looking just at the company’s defense, space and security revenues, the Air Force One project would represent about 1 percent. Finally, Trump’s contention that spending is "out of control" is more open to debate. While the program is expensive, it’s so new that it hasn’t busted through budgetary targets yet. "There have been no overruns," Aboulafia said. "This has always been the plan." Our ruling Trump tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" The company is actually building two planes, not one. As for the price tag, Trump has more of a point. The project’s current cost is $3.73 billion, which is within shouting distance of Trump’s "more than $4 billion." That’s a projection over 12 years. Also, that figure is an amount that could rise as time goes on. However, Trump glosses over some important context. National-security requirements, not Boeing, have been the primary driver of high costs. Experts say the costs are broadly in line considering the high-tech and security requirements of a presidential plane. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ff7237d1-b009-406c-a106-f6850c360944	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-12-06T17:33:19	2016-12-06	['Boeing']

When asked why Hillary Rodham was fired, Zeifman said in an interview, ‘Because she was a liar. She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality.’"	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/22/blog-posting/no-hillary-clinton-wasnt-fired-during-watergate-in/	Hillary Clinton isn’t running for office but she’s still grist for the GOP mill, so it should come as no surprise that an old claim about her credibility is making the rounds running up to the midterms. Clinton was featured in an old photo that was first posted to Facebook on Oct. 9, 2016 and is still gathering comments, shares and reactions. "In Case Y’all Forgot!!!!" the caption to the photo began, "As a 27 year old staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate investigation, Hillary Rodham was fired by her supervisor, lifelong Democrat Jerry Zeifman." The words surrounded a printed picture of Clinton from back in 1974, when impeachment charges were brought against then-President Richard Nixon. The post continued: "When asked why Hillary Rodham was fired, Zeifman said in an interview, ‘Because she was a liar. She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer, she conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the Committee, and the rules of confidentiality.’" The person who posted the picture wrote on her Facebook page that it was a news clipping she saved 20 years ago. This particular post dates back to October 2016, when Clinton was the Democratic presidential nominee, but as of this week, it’s been shared more than 253,000 times with people continuing to comment today. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Though the person who posted the image didn’t respond to a message seeking more information, they’re not alone in circulating the allegation. Clinton was one of dozens of attorneys hired by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in 1972 to work on the Watergate impeachment inquiry. Zeifman, who was Democratic general counsel to the committee during the Watergate scandal, died in 2010, so we can’t ask him if he fired her because she was a liar. But other people have. In 1999, Lance Gay reported for the Scripps Howard News Service that Zeifman didn’t have "flattering memories" of Clinton’s work on the committee. "If I had the power to fire her, I would have fired her," Gay quotes Zeifman as saying. Gay also interviewed Jay Woods, an Oakland attorney who supervised the lawyers, for the story. Gay, who described Woods as Clinton’s "ex-boss," reported that he described her as capable and cheerful. Less than a decade later, Zeifman changed his story, according to the Washington Post. In a 2008 interview on "The Neal Boortz Show," fact-checker Glenn Kessler reports, Zeifman was asked directly if he fired her. "Well, let me put it this way," he said. "I terminated her, along with some other staff members who were — we no longer needed, and advised her that I would not — could not recommend her for further positions." That year, an article by Dan Calabrese, founder of North Star Writers Group, claimed Zeifman was Clinton’s supervisor and had fired her. Clinton, who was making her first run for president that year, denied the allegation. Calabrese also quotes Zeifman as making the same statement that appears in the Facebook post. But Zeifman’s credibility has been questioned over the years. In a 1996 review of his book, "Without Honor: Crimes of Camelot and the Impeachment of President Nixon," Washington Post reviewer Matthew Dallek notes that Zeifman’s book "will surely excite conspiracy buffs on the lookout for sinister coverups in high places. But those wary of such unsubstantiated theories (myself included) will find Zeifman’s book an unconvincing, if imaginative intrigue." Snopes points out that Zeifman didn’t claim he fired Clinton in that book; it wasn’t until later that his recollection changed. Perhaps the best proof of whether Clinton was fired or not is in her pay records. Judiciary Committee pay records that were unearthed in 2016 by Washington Post researcher Alice Crites show that Clinton was paid through Sept. 4, 1974—after Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974, and after the committee published its final impeachment report on Aug. 20, 1974. We rate the claim that Hillary Clinton was fired from her job as a staff attorney during the during the Watergate investigation False.

pomt-07348	Says President Barack Obama’s debt commission recommended converting Medicare "to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/10/tom-petri/wisconsin-gop-rep-petri-says-obama-commission-reco/	When House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan submitted his 2012 federal budget plan in April 2011, he touted how much more it cut spending, debt and deficits than President Barack Obama’s plan. Some of the loudest objections to the Wisconsin Republican’s proposal, however, decried its transformation of Medicare. MoveOn.org, a left-leaning political advocacy group, went so far as to say Ryan would abolish the 46-year-old program in 10 years. We ruled that claim False, partly because current Medicare recipients would continue to receive traditional Medicare even after 10 years. But, as we noted, Ryan’s plan would change Medicare dramatically. Starting in 2022, Medicare would no longer directly help pay for doctor visits, hospital care, other services and prescription drugs. Rather, future Medicare participants would choose a private insurance plan and Medicare -- through what are called premium-support payments or vouchers -- would help pay for the insurance. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that studies health care policy, noted that in the days after Ryan’s budget plan was released, three national polls found Americans divided on such a change. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wisconsin, was conducting his annual survey of constituents. In his April 2011 newsletter, the 32-year Fond du Lac congressman posed this question to residents in the 6th District, which is north and west of Milwaukee: "One of the recommendations put forth by the president’s debt commission was to convert the Medicare system from a government-run insurance program to a system where Medicare participants are given a voucher to purchase insurance in the private market. Would you support such a change?" That left us with this question: Did a commission created by a Democratic president recommend the same sweeping change to Medicare that was part of the House GOP budget? The debt commission mentioned in Petri’s question -- the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform-- was formed by an Obama executive order in February 2010. The 18-member panel included Ryan, who was appointed by Republican leaders of the House of Representatives. The commission was charged with making recommendations to balance the federal budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015. The recommendations came in a report issued in December 2010. This is what Petri’s survey question cited in saying the commission recommended a voucher program for Medicare. The word voucher appears only once in the commission’s 66-page report, as part of Recommendation "3.3.13." The recommendation addressed Federal Employees Health Benefits, the health insurance program for federal employees and retirees. The commission said the insurance should be made into a premium-support or voucher program. Federal retirees could use their voucher to pay part of their Medicare premium. But that is for a limited group, federal employees and retirees. That is not transforming all of Medicare into a voucher program. Had that recommendation been made, it undoubtedly would have stirred the same criticism that the Republican plan has. The commission’s report noted that two commission members -- Ryan and Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bill Clinton -- had proposed converting Medicare into a voucher system. The commission’s view was that such a system "holds significant promise of controlling costs, but also carries serious potential risks." The commission suggested that, if its recommendation were put in place to make health insurance for federal employees and retirees a premium-support or voucher program, "that experience would be useful in considering a premium-support program for Medicare." So, the president’s commission recommended trying a voucher program with federal employees and retirees and then, based on the results, deciding whether to try it with Medicare. After we contacted Petri’s office on May 6, 2011, spokesman Niel Wright said the wording in the constituent survey question about Medicare was incorrect. He said the question should have stated that the president’s commission "discussed," rather than recommended, making Medicare a voucher program. Also after our call, this note was added to the electronic version of the survey question on Petri’s website: "CORRECTION: The question above is somewhat misleading. Instead of saying that the recommendation was ‘put forth’ by the president's debt commission, the question should read that this recommendation was ‘discussed’ by the president's debt commission." Wright told us that when Petri’s office distributes results of the survey, a note will be included "indicating that a problem with this question was brought to our attention," as would "additional information clarifying how the question should have been phrased." Wright also said the survey was reviewed by the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards, also known as the Franking Commission, and that "neither the Republican nor the Democratic staffers at the commission noticed anything objectionable" or partisan. Turning to the Truth-O-Meter, in surveying constituents, GOP Congressman Tom Petri said a commission created by the Democratic president had recommended making Medicare a voucher program. The commission did not make that recommendation and Petri admitted the wording in his survey was wrong. We rate his statement False.

pomt-10054	The Senate version of the economic stimulus package includes "millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/03/jon-kyl/stimulus-plan-includes-plan-compensate-filipino-ve/	In an interview with Fox News Sunday , Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., argued that the Democratic-backed economic stimulus package is so full of waste and clutter that legislators ought to scrap it entirely and start fresh. "I mean, there are so many different things that you can make fun of in this bill," Kyl said. "Let me just mention one — millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines. Now, that may be a good thing to spend money on, but not in a stimulus bill. It doesn't stimulate anything." Does the Senate version of the stimulus package really include millions for Filipino vets? The answer is yes. And no. Let's start at the beginning. During World War II, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos fought for the United States with the promise that after the war they'd get a path to U.S. citizenship and would also qualify for full veterans benefits. Thousands of Filipinos died in the infamous Bataan Death March. But soon after the war, Congress reneged and established that Filipino veterans would not be recognized as “active service” for the purpose of any U.S. law conferring "rights, privileges or benefits." Filipino veterans activists have been fighting it ever since. Fast forward to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, otherwise known as the economic stimulus bill. In the 735-page version of the bill now before the Senate, there are a full seven pages dedicated to "Payments to eligible persons who served in the United States armed forces in the Far East during World War II." It details a plan to compensate Filipinos who fought for the United States during World War II with lump-sum payments of $15,000 for those who are U.S. citizens and $9,000 for those still living in the Philippines. There are an estimated 18,000 Filipino vets still living who might qualify for payments; about 7,000 of them U.S. citizens. The total cost: up to $198 million. In a statement explaining its inclusion in the stimulus plan, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said the bill would right a wrong. "This nation made a solemn promise, and with hardly a hearing, we revoked it," Inouye stated. "This is not the America I know and love. This episode is a blight upon the character of the United States, and it must be cleansed." Time is of the essence, Inouye said. "It should be noted that as you read this, many of the Filipinos who would qualify are on their deathbeds. Today, the average age of these men is about 90." Whether or not the bill has merit is beside the point, said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "This has no business being in an economic stimulus bill," Eliis said. "It's just catching a ride on this legislation. It's just cluttering up an already complicated and wordy piece of legislation." Retired Col. Romy Monteyro, who has testified several times before Congress to lobby for compensation for Filipino World War II vets, said the bill has kicked around Congress for several years and "Inouye wanted to create a shortcut and put it in the stimulus package." "This is not a waste of money," Monteyro said. "These people are suffering. They are in the twilight of their lives. They should be rewarded for all they did for the U.S. during the war." But here's the thing: If passed as currently written, the money for the program wouldn't come out of the stimulus package. It was approved in another bill passed last year, said Rob Blumenthal, Democratic communications director for the Senate Committee on Appropriations. If the stimulus legislation passes, it would authorize that money to be released, he said, but "the amount of money for it in the stimulus bill is zero. The money was appropriated last year; it's not coming out of the stimulus bill." So why is it even in the stimulus plan? Well, it so happens that Inouye is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the very same committee that wrote this part of the stimulus plan. No, Inouye stated, it would not appropriate any money, but "it will close a dark chapter in the history of this country." Compensation for Filipino vets was not in the version of the stimulus plan passed by the House. The original legislation has another high-profile backer: President Barack Obama. Back in the campaign, in a May 2, 2008 "open letter to the people of Guam," Obama noted that he co-sponsored the Filipino Veterans Equity Act in the Senate "because I believe deeply that we must honor the heroic sacrifices of Filipinos who fought side by side with Americans on behalf of freedom. … This bill finally provides Filipino veterans and their survivors with the benefits that they were promised, and that they bravely earned in battle." However, we could not find any statements by Obama on whether he supports its inclusion in the stimulus package. So back to Kyl's statement that the stimulus plan includes "millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines." The Senate version of the bill does include provisions for a program to compensate Filipino vets; and most of those who would be eligible for payments live in the Philippines. And, yes, the program is "authorized" for up to $198 million. But that wouldn't actually be part of the stimulus spending. That brings us to a Half True.

pomt-00998	"Millions of people have given up looking for work altogether."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/05/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-millions-have-given-looking-work/	During a major policy address intended to increase his profile as a 2016 presidential hopeful, former Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush criticized the economic performance of President Barack Obama. "Six years after the recession ended, median incomes are down, households are, on average, poorer, and millions of people have given up looking for work altogether," Bush told the Detroit Economic Club on Feb. 4, 2015. We’ve already fact checked a similar claim about median incomes being down ( we rated it True), but we wondered whether Bush is correct that "millions of people have given up looking for work altogether." When we checked with Bush’s staff, they pointed us to two Bureau of Labor Statistics data points -- persons who are "marginally attached to the labor force" and "discouraged workers." These two measurements are similar, but slightly different. "Marginally attached workers" are those who "want and are available for work, and who have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months," but were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks prior to being interviewed by federal survey takers. The "discouraged workers" category is a subset of marginally attached workers, but they have specifically told survey-takers that they aren’t looking for work because they’re discouraged -- specifically, that they "believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify." In December 2014, there were 2.26 million marginally attached workers, of which 740,000 were considered discouraged workers. So if you use the definition for "marginally attached workers," then Bush is right that "millions of people have given up looking for work altogether." If you use the more specific "discouraged workers" definition, the number doesn’t reach into the "millions." We can see an argument for preferring the discouraged workers figures. The four-week period without searching for a job certainly suggests that a person has "given up" (as Bush put it) but it’s not proof positive. The criteria for discouraged workers is somewhat stronger for the purposes of checking Bush’s claim, because survey takers have confirmed that workers are indeed "discouraged." Still, the definition of marginally attached workers isn’t far off from what Bush said, and using that yardstick, the figure is greater than 2 million people, so it qualifies as "millions." We asked economists how close Bush was to the mark, and they agreed that he was largely accurate. "If they want work and are available and have previously looked but haven't looked recently, that sounds to me like they have given up," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. University of Chicago economist Robert Shimer agreed. "No data allows us to answer this with certainty, but the quote seems reasonably likely to be accurate," he said. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, observed that some young workers might not technically fall under the "given up" category because the weak labor market since the Great Recession may have convinced them not to begin seeking work at all, perhaps deciding instead to remain in school or become a stay-at-home parent. Still, Burtless said, "from the perspective of labor-force growth, it amounts to the same thing: A weak job market has kept them from finding work or even looking for work." Burtless said he’s "fairly confident" that roughly 3 million adults between the ages of 25 and 54 who are currently not working or looking for work would have been in the labor force if they had faced the same labor market conditions that existed in December 2007. Our ruling Bush said that "millions of people have given up looking for work altogether." There are two statistics that shed some light on this question; one meets Bush’s "millions" threshold at 2.26 million and one does not. But despite some uncertainty over the definitions and the scope of the data, economists told PolitiFact that Bush is on reasonably safe ground in making this claim. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-02-05T17:27:33	2015-02-04	['None']
pomt-00399	"My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/05/jd-wooten/wooten-says-blocked-medicaid-affected-half-million/	For years, Democrats in North Carolina have pushed to expand Medicaid, a move they say would help hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians afford health insurance. JD Wooten, A Democratic candidate for state Senate, added new fuel to the expansion debate when he blasted his opponent, four-term Republican incumbent Sen. Rick Gunn, in a campaign ad. "My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans," Wooten said in a caption posted with the video. We wondered if Wooten -- who is running in North Carolina’s District 24, which includes Alamance County and part of Guilford County -- was correct in his estimates. We decided to take a look. ‘Blocked the expansion’ Medicaid provides health insurance to low-income people. North Carolina has participated in the program since 1970 but remains one of 17 states that has not moved to expand it. Medicaid expansion — an action made possible by the federal Affordable Care Act — would give coverage to folks with household incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As a result, many North Carolinians who do not qualify for the ACA’s health care subsidies or regular Medicaid coverage would be able to escape the so-called coverage gap. Since his election in 2016, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has battled with conservatives in the state’s Republican-led legislature over the issue. There were signs of a bipartisan agreement when Republicans authored a 2017 bill called "Carolina Cares," but the legislation never got off the ground in committee. But while some state Republicans have worked toward compromise, Gunn was among many co-sponsors of a 2013 bill that rejected the ACA’s optional Medicaid expansion, clarified the state’s intent not to operate a state-run health benefit exchange and determined that Medicaid eligibility decisions would be made by the state rather than the federal government. The bill was adopted by a vote of 74 to 40 in the state House and 31-16 in the state Senate and signed into law by then-Gov. Pat McCrory. Gunn did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Republican leaders in the legislature have consistently opposed Medicaid expansion, saying North Carolina's share of the rising cost of the program would be too expensive. Senate leader Phil Berger called it a "budget-busting" expense, The News & Observer reported in 2017. ‘Half a million people’ The Wooten campaign cited several reports to support the claim that withholding Medicaid expansion was costing half a million North Carolinians health insurance. Among those were articles from the left-leaning North Carolina Justice Center, the pro-expansion Close the Gap NC and the North Carolina Medical Journal, all of which estimated that the expanded benefit would give new coverage to some 500,000 people. Most other reports predicted similar results. The U.S. Census Bureau, for example, estimated in 2016 that there are more than 440,000 North Carolinians who are uninsured and earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the actual impact would likely exceed the Census Bureau’s estimate because additional people who are currently insured on ACA exchanges could be expected to transfer to Medicaid if an expansion bill passed. "The estimate of 500,000 North Carolina residents would be covered by Medicaid is a solid estimate well within consensus, expert opinion," Anderson said. Other experts we consulted agreed. "It appears that about a half a million people is close in the estimate," said Lisa Dubay, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning, Washington-based think tank. Predictions and estimates vary, but Wooten’s claim does not seem to oversell the impact Medicaid expansion could have. In a 2017 article, North Carolina Health News reported that the number could even exceed 625,000, according to the state’s Medical Care Advising Committee, a collection of health clinic managers, doctors and administrators. Veterans affected The Wooten campaign did not say how or where it found its estimate for the impact on veterans, but the number may have come from NC Policy Watch, the news arm of the NC Justice Center, which cited a 2013 study from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute. According to that study, approximately 23,000 North Carolina veterans would receive Medicaid coverage under an expanded program. Anderson noted, however, that although the estimate resulted from a sound statistical process, it is becoming outdated. Jennifer Haley, a research associate in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute who co-authored the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study, also directed us to a more recent report issued by the Urban Institute in 2016. That report estimated that, of the 25,000 veterans projected to be uninsured in North Carolina in 2017, 2,000 would be eligible for but not receiving Medicaid and another 12,000 would fall into the coverage gap, for a total of approximately 14,000 people. This number is short of Wooten’s 23,000, but Anderson explained that the difference between the two studies’ findings is likely due to sampling error and trend changes. "The caveat with Medicaid expansion is that current veterans who make between 100 and 138 percent (of the federal poverty level) would be able to switch their insurance to Medicaid or gain coverage," Anderson said. "There are no good numbers for that. I think it is safe to say that the most recent study gives a floor of 14,000." So Wooten’s estimate may be outdated, but it does not seem unreasonable. And his larger point — that a large number of veterans would gain coverage from Medicaid expansion — holds true. Our ruling In the caption of a video posted to Facebook, Wooten said, "My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans." Wooten is mostly correct on the first two charges and close to correct on the third. Gunn co-sponsored a 2013 bill that rejected Medicaid expansion, so even if he was not solely responsible for blocking expansion, he played a role in it. Experts agree this is costing approximately 500,000 North Carolinians the chance at receiving health coverage. That would include many veterans, although the exact number is less clear than Wooten suggested. But given the available research, Wooten’s number seems reasonable. We rate this statement Mostly True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

pomt-06521	Coca-Cola’s CEO "said he finds it easier to do work in China than in the United States."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/10/rick-perry/did-perrys-coke-claim-pass-taste-test/	Texas may be the home turf of Dr. Pepper, but that state’s governor had another soft drink company on his mind during his recent visit to Georgia. Gov. Rick Perry, a leading contender for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, didn’t mention Atlanta-based Coca-Cola by name in a speech to the Georgia Public Policy Foundation. But it seemed clear Perry had paid some attention to an interview Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent gave a few days earlier to the Financial Times about the company’s business challenges here and abroad. "The CEO of that company said he finds it easier to do work in China than in the United States," Perry said in his speech to the foundation. "Now, think about that for a moment. When a Communist country has less bureaucratic red tape than America, we might just be on the wrong track." A shrewd move, perhaps, to reference Atlanta’s red-labeled soft drink company and its problems on doing business in America to "bureaucratic red tape" to a gathering of fiscal conservatives. Our question for Gov. Perry: Did he correctly characterize Kent’s comments? We were largely left to our own devices on this one. Perry’s camp did not respond to e-mails requesting comment. Coca-Cola spokesman Kent Landers said the company doesn’t comment on political statements. Landers did e-mail us portions of the interview. We read the transcript and watched a 14-minute interview with Kent that the Financial Times posted on its website. Kent and the interviewer were engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about the economy. The CEO was asked if America’s corporate tax structure hinders the company. "I believe the United States owes itself to create a or architect a 21st-century policy for both individuals as well as for companies. … That calls for a simplified tax system. That calls for a tax system that doesn’t include thousands of exemptions, and I hope we can see the leadership and policymakers come up with that tax system." "A company is at a disadvantage doing business here because of that?" came the follow-up question. "Not disadvantaged doing business here per se," Kent replied. "Everyone is disadvantaged in that it is so complicated and I think businesses like simplification, clarity, transparency. That’s not what we have in our tax code now. It’s an evolution of exceptions. "However," Kent continued, "if you talk about an American corporation competing in the world today whether it’s Chinese, whether it’s Russian, whether it’s European, whether it’s Japanese counterparts, of course we are at a disadvantage. Because we go and make an investment in Malaysia and we pay 20-plus percent, 22 percent tax after we make a profit. A Chinese company or a Swiss company comes and makes an investment, makes an investment in Malaysia, generates profit, pays 22 percent, and after the 22 percent, the Chinese or Swiss company can do whatever they want with those funds. We can’t; when we want to bring them back, we are faced with another fairly large tax burden of almost 10 percent, maybe more." Kent’s comments were the only references to China in the video interview. They didn’t really fit into what Perry said, which had us scratching our heads. The 14-minute video, however, does not contain the entire interview. In an article that accompanied the video, Kent is quoted as saying "in many respects" that it is easier to do business in China. The article says Kent cites political gridlock and America’s tax structure for his opinion. "You have a one-stop shop in terms of the Chinese foreign investment agency and local governments are fighting for investment with each other," Kent is quoted as telling the Financial Times. Coca-Cola officials have not disputed the article’s content. We believe Perry’s statement is partially accurate, but omits some details. Kent said it is easier "in many respects" to do business in China. He also blamed political gridlock in the United States, not just "bureaucratic red tape." Our rating: Half True.

pomt-14124	"We're the highest taxed nation in the world."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-us-not-highest-taxed-nation-in-world/	Donald Trump released a tax plan in September that would give huge tax cuts to the top 0.1 percent and bloat the deficit by at least $10 trillion over the next decade. But after he became the GOP’s last man standing and presumptive nominee, Trump said this week he’s considering raising taxes on the rich. "Should we assume that most of your plans, then, we shouldn’t take you at your words, as sort of that they’re floors?" Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Trump. "It is called life, Chuck. It’s not my word, of course. I put in a proposal. You know what they are? They're really proposals. People can say it’s a tax plan. It’s really a tax proposal. Because after I put it in, and I think you know the Senate and Congress, you know as much as anybody, they start working with you and they start fighting," Trump responded. "But I’m not under the illusion that that it’s going to pass. They’re going to come to me. They’re going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else." He then explained why, despite that, he’s still sticking to his guns and giving "a massive" tax cut to businesses: "We’re the highest taxed nation in the world. Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world. That’s why companies are leaving." This is a version of one of Trump’s oft-repeated talking points, and it’s inaccurate. When we looked at this claim in the past, we compared the United States to the 33 other industrialized nations in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Data from 2014, the most recent year available, shows that the United States wasn’t the most highly taxed by the typical metrics and actually places near the bottom or around the middle of the pack. Trump specified this time that he was talking about business taxes, but the essential data doesn’t back him there, either. Trump would have been more accurate if he had been more specific. The United States does have one of the highest top marginal corporate tax rates in the world. However, companies pay less in practice because they can take deductions and exclusions. When we look at the actual tax burden on U.S. companies, it’s far from highest in the world. Here’s a chart breaking it down: Tax revenue as percentage of GDP Corporate tax revenue as percentage of GDP Tax revenue per capita 1. Denmark: 50.9% 2. France: 45.2% 3. Belgium: 44.7% 1. Norway: 7.1% 2. New Zealand: 4.4% 3. Luxembourg: 4.3% 1. Luxembourg: $49,911 2. Norway: $38,016 3. Denmark: $31,054 31. United States: 26.0% 17. United States: 2.6% 19. United States: $14,204 32. Korea: 24.6% 33. Chile: 19.8% 34. Mexico: 19.7% 30. Hungary: 1.5% 31. Slovenia: 1.4% 32. Greece: 1.3% 32. Turkey: $2,985 33. Chile: $2,886 34. Mexico: $2,094 OECD average: 34.2% OECD average: 2.9% OECD average: $14,923 The World Bank’s data for 2012 — the last year for which it has complete figures — also placed the United States near the bottom in tax revenue as a percentage of GDP. Nations with lower percentages were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), a couple of oil-rich countries (Oman and Kuwait) and few impoverished states (like Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). We also looked at a 2016 report by the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers that assessed the total tax burden for a case study company in different places around the world. The total tax rate — which includes not only income taxes but also labor taxes, property taxes, profit taxes, etc. — is expressed as a percentage over the total profit. By this metric, the company would have a total tax rate of 43.9 percent in the United States, placing it at No. 64 out of 189 countries. That’s lower than the rates the company would have paid in the two countries Trump says the United States loses to, China (67.8 percent) and Mexico (51.7 percent). Moreover, it’s nowhere near the top. Our ruling Trump said, "We're the highest taxed nation in the world." By all metrics we looked at, the United States is far from the most taxed nation overall and for businesses. We rate Trump’s claim False.

pomt-06448	With recent growth "it is very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing fine."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/20/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-its-very-clear-private-sector-jobs/	During an Oct. 19, 2011, floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., made the case for passing elements of President Barack Obama’s jobs agenda. He talked about recent patterns in job gains and losses. "The massive layoffs we have had in America today of course are rooted in the last administration," Reid said. "It is very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing fine. It is the public-sector jobs where we have lost huge numbers. That is what this legislation is all about." We wondered whether Reid is right that "it is very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing fine." We first turned to data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment numbers. We’ll start our analysis in June 2009, which represented the official end of the most recent recession -- the point at which job numbers typically begin to recover. Here are the net increases between June 2009 and September 2011 for three categories of jobs: Total jobs: increase of 841,000 Private-sector jobs: increase of 1,413,000 Government jobs: decrease of 572,000 And here are the monthly averages for each category: Total jobs: increase of 30,035 per month Private-sector jobs: increase of 50,464 per month Government jobs: decrease of 20,428 per month Here are the same statistics for just the past year: Total jobs: increase of 1,319,000 Private-sector jobs: increase of 1,636,000 Government jobs: decrease of 317,000 And here are the monthly averages for each category over the past year: Total jobs: increase of 109,917 per month Private-sector jobs: increase of 136,333 per month Government jobs: decrease of 26,417 per month So Reid is correct that the job growth in the private-sector has been much healthier than it’s been for government jobs. In fact, government jobs have actually decreased, becoming a consistent drag on the economy as a whole. But is the growth in the private-sector enough to bolster the economy? Many economists say no. -- that for the private-sector jobs to be "doing fine," there would need to be more of them. Dean Baker, a liberal economist, estimates that the economy needs a net increase of 90,000 to 100,000 jobs a month simply to keep pace with population growth, based on extrapolations from Congressional Budget Office and BLS data. Factoring in the ongoing drag from government job losses, the economy is barely meeting that number over the past year, and is well below that number since the official beginning of the recovery in June 2009. Others put the monthly job gains needed to keep pace with population at 140,000 to 150,000. Still, even achieving that benchmark would essentially mean treading water, and "doing fine" would require more net jobs than that to be created every month. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, checked the private-sector job creation numbers for the first 26 months after each of the last four recessions ended. He found that 1981-1982 recession was strongest, with an average increase of 289,000 per month. The recovery from the 1990-1991 recession was second strongest, at 76,300. The current recovery ranked third, with the post-2001 recovery actually losing jobs on average every month. In Burtless’ view, "private-sector job growth falls far short of ‘doing fine,’" especially given the size of private-sector job losses during the preceding recession -- nearly 8 million in 2008-2009. A Reid spokesman, Adam Jentleson, acknowledged that Reid’s statement "could have been put more artfully." He said Reid was trying contrast consistent job gains in the private-sector with consistent job losses in the public-sector. The comment, Jentleson said, was intended to rebut Republican claims that Democrats aren’t doing much to help private-sector job growth, when in fact the Obama jobs agenda includes multiple tax cuts for small businesses that are intended to spur growth. Our ruling We realize that Reid was taking some linguistic liberties, and we agree that he has a point that the biggest culprit in the anemic job market is the situation with government jobs, not private-sector jobs. Still, at PolitiFact, we often say that words matter, and the notion that "private-sector jobs have been doing fine" is not at all "very clear," to use Reid’s characterization. Current levels of job growth are, at best, treading water, and perhaps not even that. For the economy to gain steam, it has to create, by some estimates, two to three times as many jobs per month as are currently being created. We rate Reid’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-14856	Will Hurd "tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record."	true	/texas/statements/2015/nov/15/pete-gallego/pete-gallego-says-will-hurd-votes-house-republican/	The next contest for the U.S. House seat representing Texas’ 23rd District is still a year away, but already incumbent Rep. Will Hurd is a target. Pete Gallego, an Alpine Democrat who represented the district before losing his seat to Hurd by a narrow margin in 2014, went on the attack, telling the Texas Tribune, "One of my biggest disappointments in watching Will is that Will tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record. He’s a follower." In much of Texas, loyalty to the GOP is hardly a liability. But the situation is a little more complicated in the 23rd, a swing district in the state, and the only one expected to see a real contest in the 2016 general election. Following a 2003 Republican redistricting that found the district be in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Supreme Court ordered the district to be re-drawn in 2006. Minority rights and civil rights groups have challenged a most recent 2011 Republican redistricting for congressional seats, claiming lines drawn in the 23rd dilute minority voting strength. The district stretches west from San Antonio almost to El Paso, incorporating a large swath of Texas’ border with Mexico. The competitive nature of the district has resulted in three representatives in as many election cycles. The non-partisan Congressional Quarterly and the Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report have both identified Hurd’s seat as one of the top 10 "toss-up" House seats up for grabs in 2016. In other words, the 23rd is a district in which blind partisanship could conceivably be an impediment to re-election. We were curious whether the 96 percent figure Gallego cited was literally true, or just hyperbole — and whether that number is unusually high — so we took a closer look at Hurd’s voting record. Anthony Gutierrez, the communications representative for Gallego, confirmed that the 96 percent figure was pulled from Hurd’s score by CQ Roll Call. The week Gallego’s comments were made, the number calculated by CQ was actually 96.4 percent, to be exact, although the number fluctuates constantly because it is based on numbers from the current legislative session. As of Nov. 6, 2015, it had fallen to 95.6 percent. It’s also important to put these numbers in context. During his term, Hurd has voted with the party a greater percentage of the time than the Republican average across the House over the same time period, 93.6 percent, but he diverges more often than 17 of his 24 fellow Texas Republicans, a group that has voted with the party an average of 97.4 percent of the time in party unity votes during the 114th Congress. Based on voting in the current legislative session, five of the 10 most party-loyal Republicans in the House are from Texas. Hurd was not among them. Across the aisle, the 11 Texas Democrats in the House have voted with their party 89.6 percent of the time during the 114th Congress, 92.1 percent of the time on party unity votes. If you average the percentage of the time each has voted with their party considering all terms, not just the current one, that number comes up to 92.6 percent. The spread in their voting records is also much bigger compared with the Texas GOP. The most loyal voter, the 35th District’s Lloyd Doggett, has voted with the Democrats 97.9 percent of the time in party unity votes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 28th’s Henry Cuellar sides with the party in only 69.5 percent party unity votes votes. While it’s not strictly relevant to the truth value of Gallego’s claim about Hurd, all this begs the question of Gallego’s own voting record during his tenure in the House. During Gallego’s time in Congress, he voted with his party 81 percent of the time, according to Open Congress voting records. Of course, this number can’t be directly compared with the 89.6 percent average mentioned above for Texas Democrats in the House, because that figure is for the current session, not the one Gallego served. In the interest of comparing apples to apples, we calculated how frequently Gallego’s fellow Texas Democrats in the House voted with their party during his term. The average came out to a slightly more modest 86.2 percent. Gallego was the only one-term Democratic representative from Texas in the 113th Congress, which means that for every other representative, we can compare the percentage of the time they voted with the party during that term to the percentage of the time they voted with the party in all votes over the course of their multi-term career. If we do that, we see that all but one broke with the party more often than average that term. So while Gallego still broke with the party more often than average, it was a Congress in which Texas Democrats in general voted with the party less consistently than usual. Responding by email, Hurd’s campaign manager Justin Hollis did not dispute the voting record. He leveled his own criticism of Gallego. "It took Pete Gallego losing in 2014 to finally become interested in the legislative process." It’s worth keeping in mind that since CQ and Open Congress data don’t weigh votes by importance, the numbers don’t tell the full story as far as whether a representative’s votes against the party are on substantive issues or minor procedural matters. But then again, Gallego never claimed to have the full story. Our ruling Pete Gallego said Will Hurd "tends to have a 96 percent straight Republican, straight party voting record." At the time of the statement, Pete Gallego’s claim and the percentage were consistent with Hurd’s voting record. We rate this claim True.

pomt-01426	The state’s overall revenues only returned this year to 2007 levels.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/08/nathan-deal/deal-correct-revenue-recovery-was-long-time-coming/	Public education advocates gave a collective sigh of relief on April 28. Gov. Nathan Deal signed the 2015 state budget that day, and that action gave them hope that school systems might be able to ease up on the worst of the belt-tightening measures. Unpaid furlough days. Larger class sizes. Shorter school years. State austerity cuts to public education started in 2003 --- well before the Great Recession -- and they are not ending. But this year, they total $746.6 million, and that to educators, who can do the math, looked better than the $1 billion-plus-a-year cuts in each of the five prior years. "We have been through tough times since the Great Recession started," Deal said during a candidate forum that was part of the annual meeting of the Professional Association of Georgia Educators’ foundation on September 15th. But just how tough? The governor told the crowd that it has taken until this year for overall state revenues to return to the levels they were in 2007. (The National Bureau of Economic Research declared that the country’s longest recession since World War II lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, although surveys show many people believe it has lasted much longer.) Given all the debate about state budget cuts through the years -- especially in education -- we decided to run Deal’s statement through the Truth-O-Meter. We reached out to the Deal campaign as we always do for supporting evidence. Campaign spokeswoman Jen Talaber said Deal was relying on information from the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget. OPB reports shows that 2007 was a fiscal high water mark for the state. Taxes on everything from personal and corporate income to gasoline and alcohol hit $17.8 billion that year, up $1.3 billion from 2006. Those same documents show that as the national and Georgia economies sank, so did state revenues. At the low point --- which was the fiscal year that ran from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010 -- total tax collection were about $14.5 billion -- or $3.3 billion off the peak. It wasn’t until Fiscal 2014, which ended June 30 of this year, that total state tax collections were back to -- and slightly above -- 2007 levels, budget documents show. Tax collections for 2014 were $17.9 billion -- or about $100 million over 2007 levels. The governor is right on the money on this one. We rate Deal’s statement as True.

pomt-11629	Says Evan Jenkins was Sen. Joe Manchin’s "spokesperson. It’s true!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/22/patrick-morrisey/west-virginia-evan-jenkins-joe-manchin-flak/	Did a Republican candidate in the West Virginia primaries for U.S. Senate once serve as a spokesperson for his Democratic opponent? That’s the accusation of Republican hopeful and Attorney General Patrick Morrisey lobbed at his opponent, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins on Twitter on Jan. 18, 2018. "Do you remember when @EvanJenkinsWV was @Sen_JoeManchin’s spokesperson? It’s true! How will Jenkins effectively criticize Manchin when he was his spokesperson & held a fundraiser for him. Manchin will simply portray Jenkins as a dishonest flip-flopper, & it will be true. #wvsen," Morrisey tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Jenkins has switched parties several times. He switched from a Democrat to Republican in July 2013 to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. But Jenkins was never on Manchin’s payroll in the typical manner of a "spokesperson." In the parlance of political campaigns, it is the role of a spokesperson to offer public statements for the candidate that appear in news stories and press releases. That is not what Jenkins did, although he did support Manchin back then as a fellow Democrat. Morrisey’s tweet was in reference to a public candidate forum sponsored by the local chapter of the NAACP and the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition in October 2004. Jenkins, then a Democrat, represented then-Democratic gubernatorial candidate Manchin, at the event. "Incumbent legislative candidates present included delegates Kevin Craig, Margarette Leach and James Morgan and senators Bob Plymale and Evan Jenkins, all Democrats," The Huntington, West Virginia Herald-Dispatch reported on Oct. 27, 2004. "Jenkins was there to represent democratic gubernatorial candidate Joe Manchin." Manchin did not attend the forum, where candidates for the state Legislature and county and city offices fielded questions on crime prevention, the environment and education, according to the news report. Morrisey spokeswoman Nachama Soloveichik clarified that Jenkins wasn't an official part of Manchin's team as a spokesperson, but rather, acted as his representative at this event. She did not provide evidence of any other times this occurred. Neither Jenkins nor the reporter, Jean Hardiman, recall how exactly Jenkins represented Manchin. "Evan does not recall that local forum in detail but knows he did not give a speech or answer questions on Manchin’s behalf," Andy Sere, Jenkins’ spokesman, said. Sere offered Jenkins likely passed along his colleague’s regrets for his absence. "At a lot of events, one politician will stand up to speak for someone who couldn’t be there and read something on the person’s behalf, or offer to relay concerns or take questions on the person’s behalf," Hardiman said. "This may or may not have been the case. And he may or may not have been officially asked to be there, but I didn’t ask that question apparently." Morrisey’s spokeswoman said it doesn’t matter that Jenkins wasn’t paid or hired to represent Manchin. "He did it as a friend and political compatriot. That’s the whole point," Soloveichik said. "How can he credibly take on Manchin when he was serving on Manchin’s team not that long ago — representing him at events and hosting fundraisers for him." A spokesman for Manchin’s Senate campaign, Grant Herring, recalled Jenkins as a "big supporter" of Manchin in past campaigns. Jenkins hosted a 2007 fundraiser for Manchin in his Huntington home, referenced in the Morrisey tweet. "Joe Manchin was much different before Washington changed him," Sere of the Jenkins campaign said. "When they served together in Charleston, Evan and Manchin both supported tax cuts, pro-life, pro-gun and pro-coal policies. As governor, Manchin was endorsed by the NRA and West Virginians for Life; Morrisey is thus impugning those conservative groups, as well, when he attacks those who backed Manchin when he was not the liberal he is today." Our ruling Morrisey tweeted, "Do you remember when @EvanJenkinsWV was @Sen_JoeManchin’s spokesperson? It’s true!" Jenkins once represented Manchin at a public candidate forum in Huntington, W. Va. Neither Jenkins nor the reporter recall his role at the event, but Morrisey said Jenkins was not paid to do so, or hired by the Manchin campaign as an official spokesman at any time.

pomt-13871	Says "while serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer-funded junket to China."	pants on fire!	/colorado/statements/2016/jul/05/colorado-citizens-accountable-government/group-says-colorado-senate-candidate-voted-China/	For the second straight election, a conservative group has attacked a Democratic Colorado state Senate candidate with the same claim: "Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer-funded junket to China." In late June, political mailers started arriving at homes in the northwest Denver suburbs of Senate District 19. They featured a photoshopped image of a smiling Zenzinger wearing sunglasses with dollar signs on the lenses and an ornamental Asian bridge in the background. "While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China," the mailer said. The back of the mailer showed a pagoda and elaborated on the claim, saying, "Zenzinger couldn’t be trusted with taxpayer money on the city council -- we definitely can’t trust her to oversee $26 billion in the State Senate." The mailers were produced by Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government, a conservative 527 political group. 527s are tax-exempt entities (organized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code) that can collect unlimited donations and influence a political issue, policy, appointment or election. But to maintain nonprofit status, the groups cannot expressly advocate that people vote for or against a candidate. The same group attacked Zenzinger for a taxpayer-backed junket to China in 2014. But just as before, there are key problems with these attacks. "I’ve never been to China," Zenzinger told PolitiFact. "I was joking to friends, believe me if I had been to China, I would have had so many pictures on Facebook they wouldn't have to Photoshop my picture in the ads." Also, while on the Arvada City Council in 2013, Zenzinger made -- and then voted for -- a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for a proposed sister-city delegation to China. No city officials ever went on the trip. But you wouldn’t know that from this mailer, or a 2014 TV ad called "China Girl" that targeted Zenzinger, who was running to hang onto her Senate seat. Zenzinger had been appointed in 2013 to the District 19 seat to replace Democratic Sen. Evie Hudak, who resigned in the face of a recall effort by gun-rights groups angered by gun-control laws passed by Democratic lawmakers after the deadly mass shooting at an Aurora movie theater in 2012. Zenzinger lost the election by 663 votes to Republican candidate Laura Woods — a defeat she blames on the misleading TV ad and mailers with the same misleading theme. Now Zenzinger is running in a rematch against Woods. "I would knock on people's doors and they'd be like, 'Oh yeah, you went to China,’ " she said. So if there was no trip, what is the mailer talking about? A 2013 council meeting As evidence, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government emailed PolitiFact a brief excerpt from the minutes of an Arvada City Council meeting on April 1, 2013. Council members were discussing an invitation from the mayor of Arvada’s sister city, Jinzhou, China, to send an official delegation from Arvada to the 2013 World Landscape Art Exposition. A nonprofit group, Arvada Sister Cities International, recommended that the invitation be accepted and that an official delegation -- including Arvada city officials, members of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Arvada Sister Cities -- attend the Jinzhou expo. Councilman Bob Dyer made a motion to accept the group’s recommendation and send a delegation to Jinzhou, according to the meeting minutes. Before the vote on the motion, the 527 group points out, Mayor Marc Williams said he was uncomfortable using public funds on the trip. The mayor said "since he understands the motion includes sending delegation members from the city at city expense, he cannot support it," according to the minutes. However, he said he would back sending Zenzinger as the elected representative if her travel was privately funded. Zenzinger voted for the Dyer motion to send a delegation, but it failed, 4-3. But that wasn’t the end of the meeting. The group attacking Zenzinger left out what happened next. Zenzinger then made her own motion, saying if a city delegation was sent, the money would come from a non-city source. "Councilmember Cook asked if Ms. Zenzinger is suggesting that no city costs be used in the delegation and Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger said yes," the minutes state. "Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger clarified...that if Sister Cities is unable to fund them, then we would come back and decline the invitation." Zenzinger’s motion passed on a 5-2 vote. Ultimately, no city officials or employees went to China because no private funding was found. ‘Outrageous fabrications’ Several people who were at the council meeting on the China delegation proposal blasted the attacks on Zenzinger. City Councilman Mark McGoff called the current mailers and the 2014 TV ad "outrageous fabrications." "I'm appalled by that because it besmirches Rachel Zenzinger's reputation and it's made out of whole cloth. There's just nothing there. She didn't vote to send herself on a junket and she didn't go on a junket," McGoff said. Just because Zenzinger voted to send a delegation doesn't mean she "intended to use city funds," said Edna Gordon, president of Arvada Sister Cities. Participants paid their own way on previous sister city trips, including a 2008 delegation when two councilmembers and the city manager went to Jinzhou (before Zenzinger was on the council), Gordon said. Even the local Arvada Sister Cities group’s members paid for their trips. Williams, the mayor, has a different view of Zenzinger’s initial vote in favor of Dyer’s motion to "send a delegation to Jinzhou." "Did she support a motion that would have funded through city funds the opportunity for her to go? Yes, she did," the mayor said. But he stressed that she also made the subsequent successful motion "with the explicit direction that no city funds be used." "My negativity toward their ad is that it implies that she actually took that trip, and she didn’t," Williams said. Zenzinger disagrees with the mayor’s interpretation. "Yes, I voted to approve an ‘official’ delegation, which meant that an elected official would make the trip," Zenzinger said in an email. "The funding for the delegation was not addressed until the subsequent vote." "Mayor Williams’ comments about funding, even though they were not relevant to the original motion, prompted me to make a second motion that clarified and distinguished that this delegation would receive no funding from the city," Zenzinger added. Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government did not respond to additional requests for comment from PolitiFact. Our ruling In a political mailer, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government stated, "While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China." As of a member of the Arvada City Council, Zenzinger did vote on a failed motion to send an official delegation to a sister-city event in China. This hardly supports the political group’s accusation. Not only did Zenzinger initiate a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for the delegation to China. She never even went to China! The attack is a gross distortion of the facts.

pomt-02299	"Two-thirds of the people who receive the minimum wage are female."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/02/cokie-roberts/cokie-roberts-two-thirds-minimum-wage-earners-are-/	Many Democrats are eager to debate raising the federal minimum wage because it’s a popular issue to the party base, especially women, says ABC News political commentator Cokie Roberts. "When you're talking about the minimum wage, you're talking about women," Roberts said March 31 on NPR’s Morning Edition. "Two-thirds of the people who receive the minimum wage are female, and this is one of many attempts on the part of Democrats to get out the voters who normally don't vote in an off-year election, to try to get them to the polls this year. We’ll see whether that works or not." Is her statistic accurate? The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, a hub for data on American workers and the unemployed, had just the report, "Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2013." The BLS collects this data through a national monthly survey of households called the Current Population Survey. It does not account for overtime pay, tips or commissions workers earn above their hourly wage. Of the 75.9 million Americans who earn hourly wages (and make up half of the nation’s workforce), 1.5 million earn exactly the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, and 1.8 million earn less than that, according to BLS. Here, we’re focused on the gender composition of those 3.3 million workers who earn at or below the minimum wage. We found it’s true that women have a disproportionately high place in the minimum-wage workforce than men. In 2013, 62.4 percent of workers, or 2.06 million people, who earned at or below the federal minimum wage were women. This was down slightly from the year before, when it was 64 percent. It’s important to know this data only isolates workers who make the federal minimum wage of $7.25 or below. Many states have set a higher minimum wage for their residents. The BLS measure would not account for minimum-wage earners in California, who earn $8 an hour, or their counterparts in Washington, who earn the highest minimum pay in the country of $9.32. A recent Congressional Budget Office report pointed out half of all workers live in states where the minimum wage is more than $7.25 an hour. Still, these caveats do not undermine Roberts’ point, said Heidi Shierholz, a labor economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which supports increasing the minimum wage. An increased federal minimum wage to $10.10 would set a new floor for all workers in the country, even those in states that set their own minimum wages. And it wouldn’t just lift the pay of workers who earn $7.25 an hour, but also those who make slightly more, such as $8 or $9 an hour. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found women would make up 55 percent percent of workers who would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $10.10 by the second half of 2016, a congressional proposal backed by the White House. That figure aligns with CBO data, too. "If you raise the wage floor, more women will be affected by that," Shierholz said. "That’s the bottom line." The discrepancy in pay between men and women known as the "gender gap" is closer at the bottom of the income distribution than at the top 1 percent of earners, Shierholz said. The gap is closing as a result of more women going to college and stagnated male wages. The White House argues raising the minimum wage would further tighten the gap because women are overrepresented in low-paying professions. The amount of women in tips-based jobs, such as hairstylists and waitresses, is even higher than the female share of the federal minimum wage workforce, Shierholz said. Employers are allowed to pay workers a minimum of $2.13 an hour as long as their tips or at least $5.12, or the difference between $2.13 and $7.25. The White House also wants an increase in the tipped minimum wage of $2.13 an hour to $4.90 by 2016 under the proposed Harkin-Miller legislation. Efforts to reach Roberts through ABC News were unsuccessful. Our ruling Roberts said, "Two-thirds of the people who receive the minimum wage are female." The actual figure is just a little bit lower. Federal data shows 62 percent of people who earn the federal minimum wage or below are women. The federal data has limitations, as it does not account for women in states with a higher minimum wage. One study says that if the federal government raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, women will benefit more than men by a 55-45 percent spread. Roberts claim is on the right track but needs some additional information. That falls into a rating of Mostly True.	None	Cokie Roberts	None	None	None	2014-04-02T14:42:38	2014-03-31	['None']
pomt-01880	"In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/09/sean-spicer/gop-spokesman-says-supreme-court-unanimously-ruled/	House Speaker John Boehner’s threat to sue President Barack Obama is either a political stunt or a necessary course of action against an errant administration, depending on what side of the aisle you fall. On CNN’s State of the Union July 6, 2014, the debate bore out along expected lines. After liberal radio host Stephanie Miller claimed, "President Bush had way more executive orders than President Obama" (a topic we have tackled in previous fact-checks), Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer said Obama’s actions are "fundamentally different than has ever happened before." Proof? How about his recent record with the Supreme Court. "In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders," Spicer said. This was a bit of deja vu for us. Just one week earlier on another Sunday political show, Fox News Sunday, we heard a very similar claim from Rep. Bob Goodlatte. We rated it False. Goodlatte claimed that the Supreme Court decision in National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning was "the 13th time the Supreme Court has voted 9-0 that the president has exceeded his constitutional authority." Spicer’s statement relies on the same incorrect premise as Goodlatte’s comment, and in fact takes it a step further. (In an email to PolitiFact, he also admitted that he "misspoke in using the statistic.") Let's explain why. Goodlatte provided us a list of the cases he was referring to. We reviewed them, and enlisted the help of constitutional law experts to take a look as well. We had several issues with the list. For starters, nine of the 13 cases actually originated when President George W. Bush was in office. Bush’s Justice Department handled the initial court proceedings in most of those instances. Obama’s Justice Department in many of the cases handled the appellate process and ultimately defended the actions to the Supreme Court. But that’s commonplace, experts we spoke with said. Only one of the 13 cases actually had to do directly with Obama’s overreach: National Labor Relations Board vs. Noel Canning. In that case, decided in June, the Supreme Court said unanimously that Obama went too far when he appointed members to the National Labor Relations Board when the Senate wasn’t technically in session. But even that case had nothing to do with what Spicer said last weekend on CNN. Spicer claimed that the court has unanimously rejected "the president's executive orders" 13 times in three years. Executive orders are a lot different, and a lot more specific, than "constitutional authority," which is what Goodlatte said. Executive orders are official actions taken by the president directing the federal government and bureaucracies. They carry the power of law, but can be revoked or amended by future administrations and are limited in scope. It does not appear that any of these cases actually have to do with executive orders issued by Obama. In the case concerning the National Labor Relations Board, for example, the issue was the president’s power to make appointments. There was no executive order issued that named individuals to positions to the board. In United States vs. Arizona, another case on the list, Obama’s justice department took Arizona to court over the state’s tough immigration laws. But it wasn’t the result of an executive order from Obama. In one of the cases, McCullen vs. Coakley, the Obama administration was not even a plaintiff or a defendant in the case. The case was a challenge to a Massachusetts law that put no-protest zones around abortion clinics. While the Obama administration filed a brief supporting the Massachusetts law, no executive order was filed or challenged. And again, most of these cases were started under Bush, so any executive action was likely coming from the previous administration, not Obama. Our ruling Spicer said, "In the last three years alone, 13 times, the Supreme Court, unanimously, 9-0, including all of the president's liberal picks, have struck down the president's executive orders." Most of the litigation actually came in response to actions under the Bush administration. In the few cases initiated during Obama’s two terms, the court wasn't even ruling on challenges to Obama’s executive orders. Spicer took an already debunked argument and made another mistake in repeating it, so it was even more incorrect. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05369	Says no Austin City Council "member lives south of" Lady Bird Lake "or north of 45th Street."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/may/09/shaun-ireland/shaun-ireland-says-no-austin-city-council-member-l/	Austin City Council candidate Shaun Ireland recently claimed, in his campaign video among several from candidates posted on the city’s website, "Not a single City Council member lives in South Austin. Nor in North Austin." In May 2011, we looked at a candidate’s statement that "there’s no one from South Austin on the council," and found that was True. Only one face on the council has changed since then, but what about their current home addresses? Ireland, who himself lives on Manchaca Road in the South Lamar neighborhood of South Austin, told us by email that he pulled council members’ addresses from their personal financial statements filed with the city, and sent us his findings. Meanwhile, in an Austin American-Statesman news story published online May 7, 2012, he narrowed his claim, saying that "no council member lives south of (Lady Bird Lake) or north of 45th Street." We called council members’ city and campaign staff for the most up-to-date information. Ireland’s opponent, Place 6 incumbent and Mayor Pro Tem Sheryl Cole, is one of two council members who live in East Austin -- Cole in Wilshire Woods and Mike Martinez in Senate Hills. Mayor Lee Leffingwell lives in the Highland Park West/Balcones Area neighborhood. Laura Morrison resides in Old West Austin, Chris Riley is downtown and Bill Spelman hails from Hyde Park. The council’s newest member, Kathie Tovo, lives north of the University of Texas in the Heritage neighborhood. All the addresses are north of Lady Bird Lake. Are they all south of 45th Street? This is where Ireland’s claim gets interesting, because 45th Street does not extend across the entire city. It’s not oriented directly east-west, either. But if you drew a line extending 45th Street across the entire city map, Martinez and Leffingwell’s homes would both lie less than a mile north of that line. Ireland told us, "All City Council members live within six miles of each other … none live south of downtown or north of Koenig (Lane) -- magnetic north, true north, or past the 45th street parallel, whichever the case may be. There are no council members that reside in the Arboretum or near Parmer and Metric, or Onion Creek or the ‘Y’ at Oak Hill." Our ruling No council members live in South Austin, as Ireland says, and five council members live south of 45th Street. If that street were extended east and west, though, Leffingwell and Martinez would land north of it, though not by much. We rate Ireland’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00098	Says she’s "leading the fight" to "force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2018/oct/30/martha-mcsally/fact-checking-martha-mcsally-pre-existing-conditio/	U.S. Rep. Martha McSally is promoting herself to Arizonans as someone who’s led the fight to guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions. McSally, a Republican running for the state’s open Senate seat, says in a new ad that she is "leading the fight to secure our border, force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions and protect girls and women from sex trafficking." Has McSally, an Air Force veteran, led the fight to "force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions"? That’s not what her voting record shows. McSally in 2015 voted for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In 2017, she voted for a repeal and replace bill that health care law experts say undermined the Affordable Care Act. It is the Affordable Care Act that forces insurers to cover pre-existing conditions. McSally is competing against Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who’s also taken credit for protecting Arizonans’ health coverage. (See our fact-checks of Sinema’s claims.) McSally’s voting record McSally has aligned with the Republican Party’s goal of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, the health care bill signed into law by former president Barack Obama. Before the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions (health problems people had before a new coverage started). Insurers also were able to charge higher premiums based on health status. The Affordable Care Act prohibited those practices, effectively forcing companies to insure people with pre-existing conditions. McSally in February 2015 voted for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The bill directed House committees to offer new legislative proposals, including one with a provision to "provide people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage." That bill passed the House, 239-186, but died in the Senate. In May 2017, McSally also voted in favor of the American Health Care Act, a Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. It passed the House, 217-213, but again, failed in the Senate. How would the American Health Care Act affect coverage for pre-existing conditions? McSally and other Republicans say that although they want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, they also want to protect people with pre-existing conditions. McSally’s campaign spokeswoman, Torunn Sinclair, said McSally "played a large role" behind the scenes in the American Health Care Act’s amendment process. "Especially by setting the tone with leadership and other members that pre-existing conditions must be protected," Sinclair said. The American Health Care Act said nothing in it "shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions." But it also allowed states to apply for waivers to certain Affordable Care Act rules. In states with a "community rating" waiver, insurers would have been able to raise premiums, for one year, for people with pre-existing health conditions who did not have coverage for at least 63 straight days the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office in a 2017 analysis said that less-healthy people, including those with pre-existing conditions, would ultimately be unable to buy individual health insurance (policies not tied to an employer) at premiums comparable to those under the Affordable Care Act, "if they could purchase it at all." Additional funding from Upton/Long amendment During the 2017 debate for the American Health Care Act, McSally "successfully negotiated $8 billion in additional funding to bring down insurance costs for people with pre-existing conditions," her campaign said. McSally supported a last-minute measure known as the Upton-Long amendment to help secure enough votes to pass the American Health Care Act in the House. The amendment, offered by Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Billy Long of Missouri, made available $8 billion over five years to states granted a community rating waiver. The funds were intended to help reduce premiums or other out-of-pocket medical expenses for people with pre-existing conditions whose monthly premiums increased because of the waiver. Analyses and news reports at the time said it was uncertain how many states would apply for the waiver; the number would tell how the $8 billion would be allocated. Experts find shortcomings in McSally’s claim Health care law experts say McSally’s claim overlooks protections established by the Affordable Care Act, downplays the impact of the American Health Care Act, and overstates the Upton-Long amendment’s reach. The Republican measures would not have forced insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions — they already had to because of the Affordable Care Act. The American Health Care Act, on the contrary, weakened coverage protections, experts said. "The AHCA’s state waivers would have made it much more expensive and, in some cases, effectively impossible for people with pre-existing conditions to obtain coverage," said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings Institution’s Economic Studies Program. The Upton-Long amendment "did very little to undo those adverse effects," Fiedler said. The amendment could be helpful to some extent, "but offering a moderate level of financial assistance falls well short of ‘forcing’ insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions," said David Gamage, a law professor at Indiana University Maurer School of Law. "The bottom line is that the American Health Care Act undermined the ability of people with pre-existing conditions to be able to maintain adequate coverage at affordable price," said Allison K. Hoffman, a law professor at Penn Law School. "And then amendments like the Upton-Long amendment tried to soften the blow of some of these harms." The proposal said nothing in it was to be construed as permitting insurers to limit coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. But experts said that was "vague catch-all language," and that the bill included avenues for states to undermine that coverage. Our ruling McSally claimed she’s "leading the fight" to "force insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions." It was the Obama-era Affordable Care Act that forced insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions. McSally in 2015 voted in favor of a full repeal of the law. The bill directed House committees to offer new proposals, including one that provided people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage. In 2017, McSally voted for the American Health Care Act, a Republican proposal that kept the Affordable Care Act’s pre-existing conditions coverage. Despite language in the bill to protect people with pre-existing conditions, it included provisions that undermined that coverage and increased premiums for certain people, making insurance unaffordable in some cases, experts said. McSally did support an amendment to help reduce over 5 years increased premiums and out-of-pocket expenses that people with pre-existing conditions might face due to a state waiver allowed in the bill. McSally’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14636	"A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/27/dale-kooyenga/gop-wisconsin-lawmaker-says-federal-government-ref/	On Jan. 20, 2016, two lawmakers appeared on Wisconsin Public Radio’s "Joy Cardin Show" to discuss the State of the State speech given the previous night by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. One of the first topics to emerge was college affordability. State Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, called for state legislation to enable student loan borrowers to refinance their student loans. Refinancing, of course, allows you to get a lower interest rate on an existing loan when interest rates drop. State Rep. Dale Kooyenga, a Republican from the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield, countered by saying it’s important to find ways to reduce the amount of loans students are amassing. And Kooyenga, an accountant, said he is open to discussing refinancing at the state level. Then, however, Kooyenga stated: "A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government." If they are, then why has there been so much debate -- at both the state and federal levels -- about legislation to allow refinancing? Past fact checks We’ve examined claims about college student loans before. Half True was the rating we gave U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., when she said in 2014 that four-year college students, on average, are graduating with $30,000 in student loan debt. The best data available was mixed on whether the figure was accurate. Mostly False was the rating earned a couple of months later by Wisconsin’s other U.S. senator, Republican Ron Johnson. He had said the affluent are taking advantage of student loans at the expense of middle-class families. In some cases, affluent people get a subsidized loan and, based on repayment programs, some small portion hits the federal government’s general fund. But that’s picked up by all taxpayers, not simply middle-class taxpayers with no ties to college. In that item we described in a nutshell how federal student loans work: The Department of Education budget draws on funds from the U.S. Treasury to shoulder the costs of subsidized loans, grants and the repayment of some loans. When loan payments are collected, those funds are then returned to the Treasury. Student loans generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue annually for the federal government. Private banks also provide student loans. Now to Kooyenga’s claim. Repayment options Private banks, of course, are free to refinance student loans. The decision is based on a number of factors, including whether the borrower has substantial income. After all, a student loan isn’t like a car loan, where there is a car to serve as collateral. But Kooyenga’s claim is that Uncle Sam refinances a lot of student loans. The federal government does offer consolidation for most student loans. That gives you one monthly payment on one loan, rather than multiple monthly payments on multiple student loans. But you might lose benefits such as principal rebates and end up with a longer payment period, racking up more in principal and interest payments in the process. Student borrowers can also take advantage of different payment plans. For example, lower monthly payments in the first few years after college and higher payments over time. But when it comes refinancing, the federal government doesn’t do it. As PolitiFact Texas found in a 2014 fact check, federal law simply makes no provision for the government to offer such refinancing. The non-profit group American Student Assistance states it flatly: "There is no federal refinancing … you cannot refinance federal or private student loans into a federal loan." Indeed, that’s why Democrats have been pushing legislation to allow federal refinancing. Backers include Baldwin and Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold, who is seeking to win back his U.S. Senate seat from Johnson in 2016, as well as 2016 presidential contenders Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley. In January 2016, Minnesota announced its own refinancing program and U.S. Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., announced new legislation that would do the same at the federal level. As for Kooyenga, he told us his "comments were not meant that an individual with student loan debt could approach the federal government and refinance. I was speaking to the fact that beginning in 2008 the federal government began purchasing the loans made by private lenders." So, he was using the term refinancing in a more technical way, even though the context of the discussion was about students refinancing their loans through the government. Our rating Kooyenga said: "A lot of student loans are already refinanced by the federal government." Borrowers can refinance student loans through private banks, though it isn’t necessarily easy and comes with down sides. Democrats have pushed legislation to allow the federal government to offer refinancing, so that student borrowers can get lower interest rates. But that legislation has not been adopted, and the federal government does not do refinancing. Which means Kooyenga’s claim is False.

pomt-14564	"Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/09/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-offers-overheated-claim-where-all-r/	Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has been contending that all of his Republican opponents are climate change deniers. The matter came up during the Feb. 4 Democratic debate in New Hampshire when Sanders talked about the way money and influence are leveraged to sway political positions. "Let's talk about climate change," he said. "Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system? Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system? That is what goes on in America." Not one Republican recognizes that climate change is real? We decided to look at the positions of the GOP candidates who were in the race when Sanders made his statement. The climate change question has several elements. Some candidates acknowledge that Earth's climate has changed in recent decades but insist that natural forces — not human activity — are responsible. Some acknowledge that humans are playing a significant role in climate change but argue that there's little the United States can do by itself to reverse the global warming trend. Others are pushing for specific proposals to address the issue. So where do the Republican candidates stand? Last August, NPR produced a chart showing how all the candidates viewed the various aspects of the climate question. In addition, we repeatedly emailed all the candidates' campaigns to see if that chart was still accurate and whether there were additional nuances that had surfaced in the intervening six months. We heard from the Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina and John Kasich campaigns. Spokespeople for Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Donald Trump didn't respond. We also checked their campaign websites for updated information on how they felt about the climate change question. On the issue of whether climate has been changing significantly in recent decades, Bush, Christie, Fiorina, Kasich and Rubio say that it has. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich say it's man made. Rubio says it's not. Bush, Christie, Fiorina and Kasich have called for some degree of action to combat it. For example, Christie's campaign sent us comments from an April town hall meeting in Exeter, N.H., where the candidate said, "I don’t believe we can do this on our own. We have to have cooperation with the rest of the world. If America changes its behavior and puts up with the economic ramifications that will happen from changing that behavior in the short term, the rest of the world has to engage in it with us." Fiorina's campaign made a similar point, quoting the candidate on CNBC in September as saying that innovation would be the key: "That's how you're going to solve an intractable problem. It's always the way you solve an intractable problem. Not with regulation — with innovation." She made the same point during a Nov. 16 town hall meeting. Bush in July said humans have contributed to climate change. "The climate is changing; I don’t think anybody can argue it’s not," Bush told Bloomberg. "Human activity has contributed to it. I think we have a responsibility to adapt to what the possibilities are without destroying our economy, without hollowing out our industrial core." So clearly, some GOP candidates are not denying the problem at all. During the debate, Sanders referred to "Republicans," not the GOP presidential candidates. But two days earlier, at an event in Keene, N.H., he specifically said, "We do not have one Republican candidate for president acknowledging this (climate change) reality." Even if he was referring to party supporters in general, a 2013 Pew poll found that 23 percent of people who lean Republican say there is solid evidence that Earth is warming and human activity is responsible. And a 2013 bipartisan poll found that 53 percent of Republican voters under age 35 picked either "crazy," "ignorant" or "out of touch" to describe someone who denies that climate change is happening. Since those polls, the evidence for warming has only gotten stronger, with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration saying that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880. When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim, policy director Warren Gunnels said, "The reality is that none of the Republicans have introduced a plan to solve climate change in a way that would transform our energy system. ... Go look at all of their websites. None of them have a plan." Actually, some of the GOP candidates have posted plans that deal with energy issues, although they don't go in the direction that Sanders and scientists concerned about climate change might like. Bush's website, for example, calls for the repeal or reform of the Carbon Rule, which is President Barack Obama's executive order requiring coal-fired power plants to dramatically reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Rubio wants to get rid of some anti-pollution rules and use the free market, not government regulation, to encourage "environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity." Others say little if anything on the issue. Christie's website seems to be silent on the matter. The "climate change" section of Kasich's website has a video saying that he cares about the environment. Carson's website simply says, "Earth is in a constantly cycle of warming or cooling," Some are downright hostile. Cruz's website belittles climate change activists and calls for an end to the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and all other sources and an end to the "regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles." And Trump's issues page bluntly declares, "Climate change: It is a hoax," a claim worthy of a Pants on Fire. Our ruling Sanders said, "Not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real." In fact, we found four GOP presidential candidates who have said it is real, it's man-made, and they have offered support for actions to deal with it. Whether their proposed actions — or the actions proposed by Sanders — are the best way of tackling the problem is a matter for debate. We rate Sanders' assertion as False.

pomt-01164	"A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year" in public assistance in Wisconsin.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/12/glenn-grothman/can-single-mother-wisconsin-easily-get-35000-year-/	Once it became clear that Wisconsin Republican Glenn Grothman would win a U.S. House seat in the November 2014 elections, his penchant for making provocative statements gained national attention. So much so that, after Grothman claimed the seat held for 35 years by Tom Petri, we decided to publish an In Context article fleshing out five of his most biting sound bites. It quickly became one of our most popular items of the year. But while those statements were more opinion than fact, Grothman has also taken his turn on our Truth-O-Meter. He earned a True, for example, for saying a study showed that children who lived with a biological parent and the parent’s partner were 20 times more likely to be sexually abused. On Nov. 30, 2014, the congressman-elect made another statement that made us stop and say, "Really?" In an interview on "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a statewide public affairs show on WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Grothman said welfare reform would be one of his priorities in Washington. Saying the first step is to educate people about benefits, he declared: "A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year in total benefits between the healthcare and the earned income credit and the FoodShare and the low-income housing and what-have-you." Grothman went on to say that amount is a "bribe not to work that hard or a bribe not to marry somebody with a full-time job." We wondered how easy it is for a single parent in Wisconsin to get $35,000 a year in state and federal benefits. Grothman’s evidence Grothman based his claim on a September 2012 memo from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The bureau is a well-respected nonpartisan scorekeeper of state budget matters. But it’s important to note this memo responded to a specific request Grothman made in his capacity as a state senator, rather than something the bureau produced on its own. Lawmakers often make requests of the bureau, but the way they tailor their requests can limit the bureau's analysis. Indeed, the memo was titled: "Value of (state and federal) public assistance and student financial aid benefits and tax credits available to two hypothetical families." Both hypothetical families rented a three-bedroom apartment in West Bend (the Milwaukee suburb where Grothman then lived), had two children -- ages 3 and 7 -- and had no health insurance through an employer. The difference was that one hypothetical family was a single parent working part-time, earning $10,000 per year, and going to technical college full-time. The other example was a married couple. One parent worked full-time and the other worked part-time while attending technical college full-time. They earned $50,000 per year. When the Washington Post Fact Checker checked Grothman’s claim, it said Grothman based his $35,000 figure on what the memo estimated the single parent could potentially receive in two categories: public assistance and tax benefits. That is, more than $29,000 in public assistance -- including child care subsidies, rent assistance and food stamps -- and more than $5,000 in tax credits. When we spoke to Grothman, he cited different tallies from the memo. In addition to public assistance and tax benefits, the memo also did calculations in two more categories: student aid for the parent attending technical college and BadgerCare health care benefits. The grand totals for all four categories of benefits were vastly different. Roughly $47,000 for the single mother (again, public assistance being the largest category). And roughly $8,000 for the married couple (from student aid and health benefits, no public assistance). Although the difference between the two grand totals is about $39,000, Grothman said he claimed $35,000 just to give himself a "cushion." And he said the intent of his claim was to highlight what he called the "marriage penalty" -- lower benefits for a married couple versus a single parent. Regardless of how Grothman explained the figure to the Fact Checker and to us, either way, there are problems with his characterization of the $35,000. Understanding the figure As the Fact Checker pointed out: "It’s easy to pick and choose what would make up a person’s ‘welfare package,’ and tack a number to it. This is essentially what Grothman did" in requesting the memo. The Fact Checker gave Grothman "two Pinocchios," the second-lowest of their five ratings, for a claim that contains "significant omissions and/or exaggerations." Grothman argued to us that his examples weren’t cherry picked -- that a single parent with two children is common, and so are the vast majority of benefits the single parent could receive, including child care, health care and food stamps. But in its memo, the fiscal bureau was careful to say "no data exist on the number of households that may actually be receiving the combination of tax and program benefits" listed for the hypothetical families. The memo added: "Although the number of families who would qualify for all of the benefits described in this memorandum is unknown, it is likely to be quite small relative to the state’s overall population." One other point: Grothman made his claim in the context of reducing "welfare" benefits. But while some of the assistance he cites, such as food stamps, might commonly be considered to be welfare, other benefits -- including tax credits and student aid -- are not. Our rating Grothman said: "A single parent with a couple kids can easily get $35,000 a year" in public assistance in Wisconsin. On one level, Grothman is using a common example in terms of a single parent with two children, but his use of the word "easily" goes too far. The very analysis he cites as evidence concludes that only a small percentage of Wisconsin residents would qualify for all of the various child care subsidies, housing aid, food stamps and tax benefits that Grothman cites. Our rating is Mostly False. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.	None	Glenn Grothman	None	None	None	2014-12-12T13:47:30	2014-11-30	['Wisconsin']
pomt-07422	"Each day our nation pays communist China $73.9 million in interest on our debt."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/26/randy-forbes/randy-forbes-says-us-pays-china-739-million-day-de/	When Rep. J. Randy Forbes voted against the budget compromise between President Barack Obama and Republican leaders earlier this month, he said the measure did not do enough to cut the nation’s debt. Forbes, R-4th, said failure to address the nation’s borrowing weakens the United States and strengthens China, the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt. The representative is chairman of the Congressional China Caucus and often discusses that nation’s growing military power. "Each day our nation pays communist China $73.9 million in interest on our debt, money that is allowing them to aggressively modernize their military and increase their global influence," Forbes said in an April 14 press release. Forbes’ number -- $73.9 million a day in interest payments to China -- left our heads spinning. We set out to see if it was right. First, a little background. The total federal debt, as of April 22, was $14.29 trillion. Of that amount, about $9.65 trillion is called public debt, which refers to all federal securities held by institutions and individuals outside the U.S. government. That includes China and other foreign nations. The remaining debt -- about $4.64 trillion -- is held by the Federal Financing Bank, U.S. government trust funds, and other federal funds and accounts. The largest trust fund is the one that endows Social Security. Our discussion and calculations for this fact check, as well as Forbes’, are based on the public debt. China buys U.S. Treasury bonds in public auctions, the same way other nations and investment companies purchase our debt. The Treasury Department said that as of February 2011, China, along with Chinese companies and investment groups, held $1.15 trillion in U.S. debt. Japan was the second-largest foreign holder, at $890.3 billion, with Great Britain third at $295.5 billion. In total, about $3.16 trillion of the U.S. public debt, or 33 percent, is held overseas. The rest is owned by Americans. Because American debt has long been considered one of the safest investments in the world, the government can borrow money at very low costs, paying less than 2 percent average annual interest on its debt during the past decade. In fiscal 2010, which ended Sept. 30, the federal government spent $197 billion on interest payments for public debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If we divide that by 365 days, we reach an average daily interest payment of $539,726,027. Because the Treasury doesn’t make payments on weekends or holidays, and because debt payments vary depending on when a Treasury note was issued, the actual daily number was probably never that exact amount. On Sept. 30, 2010, China held about 12.8 percent of the U.S. public debt. If we assume China got 12.8 percent of our interest payments, it would have received roughly $68.9 million per day during fiscal 2010. Forbes based his comments on fiscal 2011, in which the CBO estimates the government will spend $225 billion, or $616,438,356 per day, on interest payments. China held 12.1 percent of public debt at the end of February. So if the 2011 estimates hold and China holds the same proportion of debt throughout the year, it would receive about $74.4 million per day. Forbes made his calculations with the March 16 public debt figures. That explains the $500,000 difference between his calculation and ours. We don’t know the exact mix of debt held by China. If the debt owned there is primarily short-term bonds, then the interest rates would be lower. If China mostly holds 10-year or 30-year bonds, it would stand to receive higher payments. Our calculations, and those by Forbes, assume China’s debt holdings mirror the larger pool of U.S. debt. Let’s review: Rep. Randy Forbes says the United States pays $73.9 million per day in interest to China. He based his statistic on the percentage of U.S. debt held by China and the CBO’s estimate of how much we will spend on interest payments during the 2011 fiscal year. We looked into the numbers and discovered that based on CBO and Treasury Department data, China likely received about $68.9 million per day during the 2010 fiscal year. Based on the nation’s February holdings and the CBO data, China should receive about $74.4 million per day in payments during the current fiscal year. Forbes got the numbers right. We rate his statement True.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2011-04-26T06:00:00	2011-04-14	['China']
pomt-00513	Says Scott Walker "said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.'"	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/24/naral-pro-choice/did-scott-walker-say-forced-vaginal-ultrasounds-ar/	The nation’s oldest abortion rights advocacy group attacked Gov. Scott Walker and his presidential aspirations on June 18, 2015 with a TV ad called "Crazy Ideas." In it, NARAL Pro-Choice America, formerly the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, made a claim about comments Walker made about abortion and transvaginal ultrasounds. Walker, according to the group, "said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.' " Let’s see if that’s what he said. Forced ultrasound law The ad, which NARAL said would run statewide in Iowa and New Hampshire for a week, begins with a narrator saying: "Scott Walker talks and talks about abortion. He said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was..."; then, to finish the sentence, an audio clip is inserted with Walker saying: "just a cool thing." The reference is to a law Walker signed in July 2013. It requires an ultrasound before getting an abortion. But the woman can choose to receive the ultrasound transabdominally, which is done externally; or transvaginally, which is what NARAL refers to as invasive. (For some women, though -- in cases of early pregnancy or morbid obesity, for example -- the transvaginal procedure may in effect be required because it is medically necessary.) ‘Cool thing’ The audio clip used in the ad is from an interview Walker did May 22, 2015 with Dana Loesch, a conservative radio talk show host in Dallas. About halfway into a 30-minute interview, there was this exchange about ultrasounds: Loesch: What place do social issues have in 2016 and why do you think so many Republican candidates are scared of them -- are scared to embrace them; they're scared to get trapped by the media? Walker: Well, I think a little bit of it is the media is a gotcha; some do at least, I don't want to say universally. But I think that -- Loesch: Oh, most of them do. Walker: Yeah. I mean, well, I'll give you an example. I'm pro-life, I've passed pro-life legislation. We defunded Planned Parenthood, we signed a law that requires an ultrasound -- which, the thing about that -- the media tried to make that sound like that was a crazy idea. Most people I talk to, whether they're pro-life or not -- I find people all the time who'll get out their iPhone and show me a picture of their grandkids' ultrasound and how excited they are; so that's a lovely thing. I think about, my sons are 19 and 20 -- you know we still have their first ultrasound picture. It's just a cool thing out there. We just knew, if we signed that law, if we provided the information, that more people, if they saw that unborn child, would make a decision to protect and keep the life of that unborn child. Walker’s comments led to some contrasting news reports. For example, the headline in the Washington Post was: "Scott Walker, discussing abortion, says ultrasounds are ‘just a cool thing out there.’" But the headline in the Huffington Post was: "Scott Walker defends mandatory ultrasounds: they’re a ‘cool thing.’" Walker did defend mandatory ultrasounds. But what he called cool was the ultrasound technology, not forcing women to get transvaginal ultrasounds. Our rating NARAL Pro-Choice America says that Walker "said that forcing women facing abortion to get invasive ultrasounds was 'just a cool thing.'" Walker did defend the law he signed requiring an ultrasound in order to get an abortion. But the "cool" reference wasn’t to forcing some women to get vaginal ultrasounds, but rather to the ultrasound technology that produces images from the womb. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-10530	Obama "only wants your children to have health insurance."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/29/hillary-clinton/his-plan-includes-adults/	Sen. Hillary Clinton made a strong new charge against Sen. Barack Obama on Feb. 28, 2008, suggesting that he doesn't care about the health needs of adults. "I want ... each and every member of the family to have health insurance," she said at a campaign event in Hanging Rock, Ohio. "My opponent only wants your children to have health insurance. I don't think that's smart." There's been lots of discussion about the differences in the candidates' health plans, and there are uncertainties about cost estimates and whether the plans could achieve universal coverage. (We have explored the health plans in detail in this article and in previous Truth-O-Meter items on Obama's claim that Clinton would force people to buy insurance even if they can't afford it and on Clinton's claim that Obama's plan would leave out 15-million people). But with her new claim, Sen. Clinton makes her strongest attack yet, suggesting that Obama is ignoring the needs of everyone except children. We find that is not an accurate description of Obama's plan. When PolitiFact asked the Clinton campaign about her comment, spokesman Mo Elleithee said Clinton was referring to the major difference between their plans: She would require everyone to purchase insurance (a mandate that has been likened to state requirements that drivers buy car insurance), while Obama only requires parents buy insurance for their children. Clinton says the mandate is the best way to achieve universal coverage. But Obama says it could penalize people with modest incomes. If premiums don't drop enough after all his reforms are implemented, people would still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won't, he contends. We won't go into all the details of Obama's plan, but it includes several elements that apply to adults: • It would expand Medicaid, the federal program that provides health coverage for the poor. • It would provide income-related subsidies to help people who don't qualify for Medicaid but still need financial help to buy coverage. • It would require employers to provide health insurance for their workers, or contribute to the cost of the insurance. If Clinton had said that Obama's plan "does not mandate insurance for adults," she would have been on solid ground. But she didn't and, given that Obama's plan has elements to expand coverage for adults, it is simply wrong to say he " only wants your children to have health insurance." We find her statement to be False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-02-29T00:00:00	2008-02-28	['None']

Isakson’s most recent statement was debated in the conservative blogosphere, with some saying he had completely changed his stance. We contacted Isakson’s office about his statements on Syria. His spokeswoman, Lauren Culbertson, said the senator had previously been undecided about his support for President Barack Obama’s resolution to use force against Syria. Culbertson said Isakson’s statement supporting military action came before the president unveiled his resolution. "Senator Isakson could not support a mission that was so ill-defined," Culbertson told us. Indeed, for days afterward, Isakson seemed hesitant to support the resolution. The senator’s full statement on Monday, said: "After carefully weighing this very important issue, I have decided that I will vote against the resolution to authorize a U.S. military strike in Syria. Over the past week, I have traveled my state and have talked personally to hundreds of Georgians. Thousands more constituents have contacted my office by phone and email. It is clear to me that Georgians overwhelmingly oppose our country getting involved militarily in Syria. The administration’s lack of a clear strategy is troubling, and the potential fallout following a military strike is also troubling." Here’s what Isakson said Aug. 31. "It is appropriate for the president to seek authorization from Congress, although I wish he would have called us back to vote on this immediately rather than waiting until Sept. 9. I support the use of military action in Syria. If we fail to take strong action against Syria for this horrendous attack, then we are sending a signal to Syria as well as to Iran and North Korea that they are accountable to no one." The senator’s initial statement came the same day Obama announced he would seek congressional approval for military action against Syria. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the following day that Isakson and Georgia’s other U.S. senator, Saxby Chambliss, backed military intervention in Syria. Chambliss is undecided on whether he will vote for the congressional resolution. (At press time, Chambliss was the lone member of Georgia’s congressional delegation supporting some sort of intervention. U.S. Reps. John Barrow and Sanford Bishop had not clarified their positions.) Between those two statements, the AJC reported that Isakson wanted a clear strategy from the Obama administration. "There's no question the Syrians crossed the red line the president drew, " Isakson told the AJC in a Sept. 3 phone interview. "And I think when you draw lines, when you don't enforce those lines you become a paper tiger. But I'm not going to blindly give this president a blank check given the commitment he's shown in the past two weeks and what appears to be a lack of a strategy. I want to be part of the debate." During an interview Tuesday with Channel 2 Action News, Isakson reinforced his reluctance to vote for a resolution authorizing military action. When asked whether he stood by comments from Aug. 31 that he supported the use of military action in Syria, Isakson said: "I support that if it was actionable and meaningful and if it sent the right signal to North Korea and Iran. … If in the total context, yes. This one, in my opinion, did not do that." "Is this a change of heart?" Isakson was asked. "No," he answered. "Is this a change of mind?" the interviewer asked. "No," Isakson replied. Some bloggers had a different interpretation. Jason Pye, a prominent Georgia libertarian, believes the senator has changed course. "In his press statement on August 31, Isakson said in no uncertain terms that he supported the use of military action in Syria, making the case that failure to respond would send a signal to the United States' enemies that they are accountable to no one," said Pye, who opposes the strikes. "The lack of strategy from the Obama administration may now be a concern for the senator, but he didn't initially seem to have a problem with that." "If this isn’t a flip-flop, I don’t know what is," Pye said. Political science professor Kerwin Swint disagreed. "Under the circumstances, I think it’s hard to blame him for waiting to see how it all plays out," said Swint, who teaches at Kennesaw State University in Isakson’s home county. "It’s a unique situation especially because so many legislators around the country are revising their positions on this in light of the changing circumstances. It’s just a weird kind of story." Culbertson directed us to recent AJC articles and other comments the senator has made on the subject, including a CNN interview Monday in which Isakson said "this is about the plan and the strategy that has been proposed to us." We wondered whether Isakson still supports military action. Culberston told us via email that Isakson hopes for a diplomatic resolution, but if that fails, "he will reassess at that time. This is a fast-moving situation that is changing every day." So where does all of this leave us? Isakson’s position is that he initially supported the use of military action against Syria. But that was before Obama’s resolution outlined his administration’s plan for what that entailed. Isakson had reservations about the proposal, and he decided to oppose the White House resolution seeking congressional authorization for military strikes. Isakson has altered his initial hard-line position on a military strike against Syria, putting additional conditions on any such attack. He initially backed a strike without stating any reservations. We rate this a Half Flip.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2013-09-13T00:00:00	2013-09-13	['None']
pomt-05908	AIDS was transmitted to humans because "one guy" had sex with "a monkey" and then started "having sex with men."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/03/stacey-campfield/knoxville-republican-says-aids-came-man-having-sex/	Of the many controversial claims state Sen. Stacey Campfield, R-Knoxville, made in an interview on satellite radio last week with a gay-rights advocate, none was more sensational than his assertion that AIDS in humans came from "one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men." This came about 12 minutes into an interview that ostensibly was about a bill Campfield has championed declaring that only sexuality involving "natural human reproduction" can be addressed in the state’s K-8 public-school classrooms. Campfield calls it a "Don’t Teach Gay" bill, but it’s been more commonly called the "Don’t Say Gay" bill. Critics say it could open the door to allowing anti-gay bullying and harassment and potentially prevent teachers and administrators from helping students properly deal with sexuality issues. We’re working on a separate article to post on Sunday that will cover many of the other claims made by Campfield, who also serves as Tennessee campaign co-director for Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign. This item will explore Campfield's specific claim about AIDS entering the human population because "one guy" had sex with a monkey and then had sex with men. Here's the pertinent exchange for this fact check: CAMPFIELD: Most people realize that AIDS came from the homosexual community. SIGNORILE: No, it did not. Do you know the history of AIDS? CAMPFIELD: It was one guy screwing a monkey, if I recall correctly, and then having sex with men. SIGNORILE: No, it was not one guy screwing a monkey. It was somebody in Africa. Do you know the history of AIDS? Because I can tell you in a minute? It was somebody in Africa who actually killed a monkey, because they eat the meat of many animals, as I’m sure you do, I’m sure you eat the meat of animals. And they ate the meat of a monkey and the blood, they chopped it up, and it got in a cut and that’s how AIDS then spread among heterosexuals all through Africa, and it is a pandemic around the world. In the days since the interview, Campfield has done other interviews and put up posts on his blog, adding some caveats and qualifiers to some of his claims. But in his blog posts, one of which he titled "More fun than a barrel of monkeys," Campfield stuck by his claim of cross-species simian-human sex as the origin of AIDS. He wrote: "The research on sex with a monkey being the first transmitter of AIDS has not been proven nor firmly dis proven (sic). It is one of about 5 theories I was able to find on the source of AIDS." We figured that because the legendary "Scopes Monkey Trial" happened in our fair state -- about 80 miles southwest of Knoxville -- PolitiFact Tennessee should examine this theory of evolution. Consequence of hunting Signorile had recently interviewed infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist Dr. Jacques Pepin, author of the recently published book, The Origin of AIDS, and Signorile accurately characterized Pepin’s research. Pepin gave PolitiFact Tennessee an even more precise account. Pepin’s research, which relies on meticulous peer-reviewed studies that include DNA evidence going back decades, concludes that HIV in humans originated in Central Africa, likely sometime in 1921, from a hunter who was exposed to contaminated blood from an ape -- perhaps a chimpanzee -- that was killed for food. A slow dissemination through Africa followed, Pepin said, through heterosexual transmission, needle injections and blood transfusions. It stayed at a "low level," he says, until 1966 or 1967 when it "was exported to Haiti" and "from there to the United States, probably at the beginning of the 1970s." Pepin agrees with Campfield on one point: that its spread in North America accelerated through infections transmitted in unprotected sex among gay men. Apes, not monkeys We also talked to Beatrice Hahn, a former longtime University of Alabama-Birmingham professor of medicine and microbiology now at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a 2010 research paper, "Origin of HIV and AIDS Pandemic." She clued us into a key distinction -- a monkey is not an ape and an ape is not a monkey. But they are both simians, the animal classification for what are known as "higher primates." She has concluded that the form of HIV most prevalent around the world, known as HIV-1 Group M, originated in chimpanzees -- and chimps are considered apes, not monkeys. Figure 1 in her paper, which cites studies from 150 research papers and was written with Penn colleague Paul Sharp (formerly of University of Edinburgh) features pictures of 10 kinds of simians and has arrows showing how SIV -- "simian immuno deficiency virus" -- made a path to humans in two major forms, HIV-1 and HIV-2. Hahn said HIV-1, the most common AIDS virus, has been documented to have emerged following "four independent transmissions of ape viruses -- not monkey viruses." A second human AIDS virus that is largely restricted to West Africa is called HIV-2, and it is declining and being replaced by HIV-1, according to the paper. That less prevalent form has been traced to a monkey called the Sooty mangabey. Hahn says the mostly likely way that the simian precursors of HIV-1 and HIV-2 entered the human population was from bushmeat hunters who killed simians for their meat. Pepin and other researchers have written the same thing, and we found no serious academic papers mentioning simian-human sex as a possible transmission route. "Human infection," wrote Martine Peeters of the retrovirus laboratory of the Institute of Research for Development in Montpelier, France, "is thought to have resulted from cutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to infected blood during the hunting and butchering of chimpanzees and Sooty mangabeys for food. Bites from pet animals and possibly contact with fecal and urine samples may have also been involved." Pepin’s book covers the same territory in great detail and cites many studies. Hahn has appeared on panels with renowned primatologist Jane Goodall to discuss the dangers bushmeat hunting poses. Not only does it endanger species of simians like chimpanzees, there is concern the practice could some day lead to other simian viruses getting passed to humans to create a new pandemic. Scientists remain unsure why SIV does not lead to AIDS in some simians, while HIV causes a deadly condition in humans. Our ruling Campfield is unable to provide any convincing evidence to back up his claim and we could find none. The overwhelming scientific research shows Campfield is wrong. Experts believe HIV entered the human population through so-called "bushmeat" hunting, and, furthermore, that the predominant HIV-1 form has never been shown to be transmitted directly from monkeys to humans. Hahn emphasized, too, that there is zero evidence to support the cross-species sex Campfield proposes: "It surely wasn’t transmitted through sexual activity (with simians)."

pomt-13000	"California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world. If you add the GDP’s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/dec/15/antonio-villaraigosa/villaraigosa-claims-california-oregon-washington-p/	Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles and 2018 Democratic candidate for California governor, recently called for the state to unite with like-minded cities and states on the West Coast to oppose "dangerous policies advanced by a Trump administration." California’s large economy, Villaraigosa said in a Dec. 8, 2016 op-ed in the Sacramento Bee, gives it leverage in any possible showdown. In making this call, Villaraigosa repeated a favorite claim by California politicians that the state’s economy ranks as the sixth largest in the world -- a claim PolitiFact California rated Mostly True in July. He then took the economic comparison further -- all the way to the Pacific Northwest. "California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world," Villaraigosa said. "If you add the GDP’s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world." "That’s power – power we must use to protect our people against any dangerous policies advanced by a Trump administration," he added. We decided to fact-check the part of Villaraigosa’s claim that if the GDPs of California, Washington and Oregon were somehow combined, they’d represent the fifth largest economy on the planet, ahead of the United Kingdom. Gross domestic product, or GDP, is used to measure the health of a country’s or state’s economy. It’s the total value of all goods and services. Our research A campaign spokeswoman for Villaraigosa pointed us to 2015 GDP figures from the International Monetary Fund. We used the same data in July to verify that California, with a GDP of nearly $2.5 trillion, had the sixth-largest economy behind the United States, China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. California Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration released GDP figures in June showing the state had jumped two spots in these unique world rankings ahead of France and Brazil and into sixth place behind the United Kingdom. In our July fact check, we noted that when adjusted for California’s very high cost of living, the state’s GDP drops several places. This led us to our Mostly True rating for the claim, which we define as "accurate but needs clarification or additional information." To come up with a combined GDP for three West Coast states, we added California’s nearly $2.5 trillion to Oregon’s $217 billion and Washington’s $445 billion, using 2015 figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Together, their GDPs add up to $3.1 trillion. This hypothetical West Coast powerhouse economy would be larger than the United Kingdom’s $2.8 trillion GDP. Villaraigosa’s claim, however, needs the same disclaimer about high cost of living. California, Oregon and Washington are all expensive places to live. We realize Villaraigosa’s comparison is hypothetical -- and it looks like he got his numbers right. But to do this, he creates a fictional California economy that magically annexes the GDPs of two nearby states. Our ruling Antonio Villaraigosa recently said: "California is once again the sixth-largest economy in the world. If you add the GDP’s of Washington and Oregon, California would surpass the United Kingdom to become the fifth-largest economy in the world." We rated the first portion of this claim Mostly True in a separate fact check in July. We crunched the numbers on the second part of Villaraigosa’s claim, about a combined and hypothetical California-Oregon-Washington economy. At $3.1 trillion, it would surpass the United Kingdom’s $2.8 trillion GDP and would rank fifth in the world. It’s important to note that some economists factor in cost-of-living when assessing a state’s or country’s GDP. Expenses are high in all three states, which means this mega-economy could be knocked down a few spots in the rankings. The former mayor’s statement needs this clarification. Overall, we rate Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b83a74d-fde6-48d9-9c72-c93824f92b4e	None	Antonio Villaraigosa	None	None	None	2016-12-15T06:00:00	2016-12-08	['California', 'Oregon', 'United_Kingdom', 'Washington,_D.C.']
pomt-09183	"A Houston school district analysis found that the (State Board of Education) more than quadrupled the number of historical figures students must learn about."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/02/kathy-miller/miller-state-board-education-more-quadrupled-numbe/	The state's social studies curriculum standards fell under the microscope this year as members of the State Board of Education squabbled over what should be taught to Texas students. In a May 18 opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman -- before the board gave final approval to revised standards May 21 -- Kathy Miller of the Texas Freedom Network, which bills itself as a watchdog group that monitors "far-right issues, organizations, money and leaders," wrote: "Teachers despair that the standards, rather than simply identifying major concepts students should master, are far too long and detailed. For example, a Houston school district analysis found that the board more than quadrupled the number of historical figures students must learn about." That sounds like a lot of names and dates to remember. We decided to look it up. In response to our inquiry, Dan Quinn, the network's communications director, pointed us to an entry on School Zone, the Houston Chronicle's education blog, reporting that the Houston school district's social studies curriculum managers had expressed concerns about some proposed changes to the standards during an April 29 district school board meeting. According to the post, the managers, Angela Miller and Michael Dorsey, said the proposed standards contained "262 historical figures that students must learn about from elementary through high school," compared with the current count of "60 people." That's more than four times as many as now. But there's a hitch. The numbers in the Houston school district analysis differ from those reported in the Houston Chronicle blog. The actual counts are 64 required historical figures under the current standards and 252 under the proposed ones -- four names short of a quadrupling. At the time of the Houston analysis, the proposed standards included changes the state education board had already made to recommendations from board-appointed "writing groups" made up largely of teachers. (The new standards are set to be implemented in 2011-12, and classroom materials and tests based on the standards are scheduled to take effect in 2012-13.) In a document prepared for the Houston school board, Angela Miller and Dorsey said they were concerned about the growth in the "number of people who are now required topics of instruction" primarily because "teachers have fewer opportunities to tailor their instruction to address the needs and interests of their students and communities. And, two, the effort to create a 'balanced' list of required individuals inevitably results in very long lists of names as each constituency advocates the inclusion of individuals representative of their interests." In her Statesman article, Kathy Miller followed up: "Historians have warned that such a 'laundry list' approach ... is a lazy and ineffective way to teach and sets up our schools -- and our children -- to fail as they struggle through a blizzard of names and facts." A little background: There are two ways to figure out how many historical figures the curriculum standards require that students be taught. You can read the standards and count the individuals who are named. Or, you can consult the lists of names that the Texas Education Agency has created for both the current and proposed requirements. Some names appear more than once on the lists -- and are counted each time -- because they are studied in more than one grade. At the time the Houston analysis was done, the proposed standards specified more than 40 names more than once. For example, economist Adam Smith was to be taught in both high school economics and world history classes. Houston officials used the first method, making their own grade-by-grade comparison -- between the current standards and the proposed ones -- of the number of historical figures that must be taught in kindergarten through eighth grade, as well as for mandatory high school social studies classes: world geography, world history, U.S. history, government and economics. To tally historical figures that students must be taught now, Angela Miller said, she and a colleague combed the current standards, adopted in 1997. For the proposed standards, Miller said, she relied on the list of names produced by the education agency; it reflected all the changes made to the proposals by the state board through March 2010. For comparison, we consulted the education agency's lists of required historical figures in the current and proposed standards. (To ensure a valid comparison, we removed any names that were part of the curriculum standards for psychology and sociology courses; those classes are electives and were not included in the Houston school district's analysis.) Our counts differed slightly from the Houston district's: 71 now vs. 250 in the proposed standards, 34 names short of a quadrupling. Angela Miller told us that she and her colleague could have erred as they perused the current standards. We also found that a difference in interpreting some objectives in the standards may explain variations in the counts. For example, the TEA list of required historical figures in the high school world history curriculum contains three names: Hammurabi, Emperor Justinian I and John Locke. All three come from this objective in the current standards: "The student is expected to identify the impact of political and legal ideas contained in significant historic documents, including Hammurabi's Code, Justinian's Code of Laws, Magna Carta, John Locke's Two Treatises of Government, and the Declaration of Independence." Angela Miller said the three names were not included in the Houston school district's analysis because knowledge of the document, not the individual, is what is required of the students. Bluntly, counting the figures required to be taught in social studies classes is not a perfect science. And there's a postscript: The proposed curriculum standards changed again when the State Board of Education met in May -- after Kathy Miller's opinion piece ran in the Statesman. Monica Martinez, TEA's managing director of the curriculum division, said that short of watching the videos of the two days of 15-hour meetings during which the state board worked on those changes, we would have to wait for the agency to release updated documents to determine the final number of historical figures that must be taught. She said the agency hoped to have those ready later this month. Based on changes made during the first day alone, indications are the total will drop from what it was when Miller made her statement. Summing up: Kathy Miller leaned on a news report quoting research by the Houston school district. Unfortunately, the blog had the wrong numbers, overstating the number of historical figures required to be taught under the proposed standards being considered at the time. That led Miller to overstate the facts in claiming that the State Board of Education "more than quadrupled the number of historical figures students must learn about." Had she relied on the original research, which was linked directly to the Chronicle blog, Miller wouldn't have goofed making her point. The changes made by the state board up to that point meant students were going to have to study a lot more historical figures than they do now -- but it's less than four times as many.

pomt-07386	"We don't have bridges being built" in the United States.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/03/donald-trump/trump-said-us-doesnt-build-bridges-anymore/	Now that President Barack Obama has released his original Certificate of Birth, Donald Trump wants to talk about other things. Like bridges. More specifically, that the United States isn't building them any more, while China is. It has become a regular talking point for the real estate mogul/potential Republican presidential candidate in recent press appearances. Here are a couple examples: "We are rebuilding China. I don't know if you know it. They're building bridges. They're building airports. They're building cities, brand-new cities. When was the last time you saw a bridge being built in the United States? We don't have bridges being built. We have bridges that are falling down." - Trump on CNN's State of the Union on April 17, 2011. "When was the last time – if you go to China, as an example – bridges being built, massive bridges. When is the last time we built a bridge in this country, other than a little toy." - Trump at a press conference in New Hampshire on April 27, 2011. Is the United States no longer in the bridge building game? We contacted the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration to get data on federal spending on bridges over the last decade. The press office prepared a report on funds obligated for highway bridge replacement, rehabilitation and maintenance for the fiscal years 2001 through 2010. The report shows a steady upward trend in federal spending (in other words, not including state and local bridge funding): from $4.8 billion in 2001; to $6.8 billion in 2008; and then jumping to $9.4 billion and $8.5 billion in 2009 and 2010 as a result of an influx of money from the economic stimulus package. It's not that the U.S. isn't spending more on bridges, said Jeffrey Solsby, a spokesman for the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. It's that it isn't nearly enough to keep pace. Over the last 30 years, the number of cars and miles driven has doubled, he said, yet the amount of road and bridge capacity has increased just 7 percent. "We didn't build it, and they came anyway," Solsby said. According to an April 28, 2011, story in The Economist, America is lagging behind most of the rest of the industrialized world in terms of investment in infrastructure such as bridges. "Total public spending on transport and water infrastructure has fallen steadily since the 1960s and now stands at 2.4 percent of GDP," the story notes. "Europe, by contrast, invests 5 percent of GDP in its infrastructure, while China is racing into the future at 9 percent. America’s spending as a share of GDP has not come close to European levels for over 50 years. Over that time funds for both capital investments and operations and maintenance have steadily dropped." Moreover, the article notes, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that "America needs to spend $20 billion more a year just to maintain its infrastructure at the present, inadequate, levels." And that's doesn't include building new bridges. In its "2010 Bridge Inventory" report, Better Roads Magazine analyzed the state of the nation's more than 600,000 bridges and concluded that a "worryingly high" number of them are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Politicians on both sides of the aisle acknowledge the problem, Solsby said. The dilemma is how to pay for it. States are financially strapped as a result of the recession. Federal dollars are stretched, too. The ARTBA would like to see an increase in the gasoline tax to fund more bridges, Solby said, but with gas prices soaring, "Is that politically palatable?" "From one perspective, he (Trump) is right," Solsby said. "Everyone else on the planet realizes infrastructure investments are a major shot of adrenaline for an economy. But it's not like we are not building bridges. We are. It's just slow." Bridge experts we spoke with rattled off a number of major bridges recently completed or well underway. Among them: * The Hoover Dam bypass bridge, which opened October, 2010. The New York Times called it "an engineering marvel and an acrophobe's nightmare." The 1,900-foot-long bridge over the Colorado River gorge, connecting Arizona and Nevada, is the the seventh-highest bridge in the world and the longest single-span concrete arch bridge in the Western hemisphere. In other words, not just a "little toy." * The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, a "major seismic retrofit" with a total project length of 8.4 miles. Cost of the East Span alone is estimated at nearly $5.5 billion. It is projected to open in both directions in 2013. * The replacement 1.1-mile Woodrow Wilson Bridge across the Potomac River, connecting Maryland and Virginia, which was completed in 2008 with a capacity for 295,000 vehicles a day. * The I-35W bridge over Mississippi River in Minneapolis, replacing the bridge that tragically collapsed in August 2007, claiming 13 lives. A new, 10-lane replacement bridge opened -- at a cost of $234 million -- just over a year later. * The Willis Avenue Bridge over the Harlem River connecting Manhattan and the Bronx in New York City. Completed last summer at a cost of $614 million, the 2,400-ton bridge span was shipped 136 miles via two barges. This is by no means an exhaustive list, just a sampling. Which is all to say: the U.S. is still in the bridge-building business. So Trump has overreached with his claims. But allowing for the possibility that Trump was exercising a bit of hyperbole to make a point about needing to prioritize infrastructure investment for things like new bridges -- an issue that data suggests is a valid and pressing concern -- we rate Trump's statement Half True.

pomt-01898	"A salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception … is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-hobby-lobby-salesclerk-not-go/	By now, lots of major political figures have weighed in on the decision in Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, a landmark Supreme Court case. A 5-4 majority ruled that a closely held, private corporation, such as the craft retailer Hobby Lobby, could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. One of the most closely watched responses was by Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State who is the presumptive frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton addressed the case during a question-and-answer session at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado. Clinton blasted the decision as "deeply disturbing." "It’s very troubling that a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception, which is pretty expensive, is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception," Clinton said. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed this claim and gave it Two Pinocchios, out of a maximum of four. We thought we’d take our own look. First, some background. The company’s owners say they object to four out of the 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved forms of contraception -- the four that prevent implantation of the embryo. These include two forms of "emergency contraception," sometimes called the "morning-after pill," and two forms of intra-uterine devices, or IUDs. (Officially, the FDA considers these four methods to be "contraception," but the company’s Christian owners consider them to be a form of abortion.) According to the Wall Street Journal, the company actually supported all 20 forms of contraception until 2012, when the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty informed Hobby Lobby about the Affordable Care Act’s contraception requirement. Owner David Green told the Journal that he was "shocked" at the discovery. He proceeded to revoke the coverage and file the suit that was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court on June 30, 2014. Contrary to Clinton’s claim, Hobby Lobby’s website says the company does in fact support the other 16 forms of contraception. Here are some excerpts from its Frequently Asked Questions page: Q: Is Hobby Lobby preventing its employees from buying contraceptives under its plan? A: Not at all. The Greens (the family that owns the company) and their family businesses respect the individual liberties of all their employees. The Greens and their family businesses have no objection to the other 16 FDA-approved contraceptives required by the law that do not interfere with the implantation of a fertilized egg. They provide coverage for such contraceptives under their health care plan. Additionally, the four objectionable drugs and devices are widely available and affordable, and employees are free to obtain them. Q: But isn’t Hobby Lobby depriving its women employees of health care? A: Just the opposite: the Greens and their family businesses, including Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., offer their employees – nearly 70 percent of whom are women – a robust benefit plan that includes coverage for preventive care and almost all of the contraceptives required under the Affordable Care Act. That plan includes an on-site clinic with no co-pay at Hobby Lobby headquarters, and all full-time employees are eligible to enroll in a generous benefit plan: including medical, dental, prescription drugs, along with long-term disability and life insurance, and a 401(k) plan with a generous company match. For the record, the 16 contraceptives the company supports, according to a Hobby Lobby spokeswoman, are: male condoms; female condoms; diaphragms with spermicide; sponges with spermicide; cervical caps with spermicide; spermicide alone; birth-control pills with estrogen and progestin; birth-control pills with progestin alone; birth control pills, extended or continuous use; contraceptive patches; contraceptive rings; progestin injections; implantable rods; vasectomies; female sterilization surgeries; female sterilization implants. Of course, not all of these forms will be equally useful to the salesclerk, particularly vasectomies and male condoms. Still, they include some of the most widely used forms of contraception, including several varieties of the birth-control pill. We found no evidence to dispute the company’s assertion that it pays for 16 out of 20 forms of contraception. So Clinton goes too far when she says the salesclerk "is not going to get" contraception through the company’s health care plan. And the fact that the company pays for 16 types undercuts Clinton’s claim that Hobby Lobby "doesn’t think she should be using contraception." Where Clinton’s claim includes a grain of truth is that the salesclerk will not have an unfettered choice in what form of contraception she gets. Say the salesclerk is unable, for medical reasons, to use the birth control pill. An IUD might be a good alternative, but it would not be available to her under Hobby Lobby’s health care plan. IUD use has been increasing in recent years, and paying for one out-of-pocket means significant up-front expenses. If IUD implantation is taken off the table, the salesclerk may be forced to choose another method -- one that may be less well-suited to the employee. There’s another nuance that leave this question in something of a gray area. The way the decision was written leaves some question about whether closely held, religious companies can choose to opt out of supporting any of the remaining 16 forms of contraception in their health plans. For the record, a spokeswoman said that Hobby Lobby "will continue to cover all 16," but that may not be the case for other companies. Already, some companies have been allowed by lower courts to stop paying for a wider range of contraceptives than were at issue in the Hobby Lobby case, according to the Associated Press. Their cases are likely to work their way through the courts, and the Supreme Court has let those policies stand pending further appeals. While the Hobby Lobby decision may open the door to judicial acceptance of more sweeping contraceptive bans, the specific comment we’re checking targeted Hobby Lobby -- and it’s significantly flawed. "To the extent she was talking about Hobby Lobby as an employer specifically, I think Clinton overstated her case," said I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology & Bioethics at Havard Law School. He added, "It may be true for a subset of employees, and to the extent she was also referring to other potential employers who might ban all contraceptives, I think she is on firmer ground." Our ruling Clinton said that "a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who needs contraception … is not going to get that service through her employer’s health care plan because her employer doesn’t think she should be using contraception." There’s reason to believe that future court decisions could allow companies to forgo payment for all types of birth control, but Clinton’s claim refers specifically to Hobby Lobby’s policies toward its employees. And in that context, her claim is greatly exaggerated. Hobby Lobby doesn’t shun contraception entirely for its employees; it pays for access to 16 out of the FDA’s 20 approved methods. Where Clinton has a partial point is that an employee would be barred from having the company pay for four other types, even if one of those may be the best medical option for the employee’s needs. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. UPDATE, July 4, 2014: After this article was published, Hillary Clinton's camp got back to us. A spokesman pointed us to a line from Ginsberg's dissent that "seems to be pretty in line with" Clinton's comments. "The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga (Wood Specialties, another plaintiff in the case) would override significant interests of the corporations’ employees and covered dependents. It would deny legions of women who do not hold their employers’ beliefs access to contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure." We stand by the rating of Mostly False.

pomt-11697	"Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/22/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-overreaches-fentanyl-figures/	Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is requesting information from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the United States Postal Services and the U.S. Department of States regarding a drug she claims is illegally making its way into the country. In a press release from Nov. 22, 2017, the senator said, "Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid, and we should use every tool at our disposal to keep it from entering the United States." The number of opioid overdose deaths has been getting a lot of attention in recent years, but is fentanyl now the leading cause? What is fentanyl? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fentanyl is a synthetic, or man-made, opioid sold legally as a pharmaceutical drug to treat pain. It is also illegally made and is increasingly used to intensify the effects (or "high") of other drugs, such as heroin. Most recent cases of fentanyl-related overdose and death have been linked to illicitly-manufactured fentanyl. Heroin is an opioid synthesized from morphine that can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance. Heroin is an illegal, highly-addictive opioid, typically injected but also smoked and snorted. Although fentanyl is similar to heroin, fentanyl is 30 to 50 times more potent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Have overdose deaths increased? There was a 21 percent increase nationally in overall overdose deaths from 2016 to 2017. The CDC categorizes six types of drugs, with fentanyl part of the "synthetic opioids excluding methadone." Fentanyl-related deaths are on the rise. A 2016 study of 10 states over six months detected fentanyl in 56.3 percent of 5,152 synthetic opioid deaths. The CDC reported a total of 20,145 overdose deaths, up from 9,445 in 2015, which means the number of overdoses related to synthetic opioids excluding methadone more than doubled between 2016 and 2017. Sarah Feldman, the deputy communication director for McCaskill, told us that "the term ‘synthetic opioids excluding methadone’ is, according to the CDC, exclusively represented by ‘fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.’" But CDC spokeswoman Courtney Lenard said the synthetic opioids category isn’t exclusive to fentanyl. She gave an example as prescription pain reliever tramadol, which isn’t fentanyl-based. In other words, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are a subset of synthetic opioids. "Fentanyl deaths cannot be separated out," Lenard said. Our ruling Sen. McCaskill said, "Fentanyl is now killing more Americans than heroin or any other opioid." The CDC says illegally manufactured fentanyl is primarily responsible for the increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids in 10 states. But fentanyl and fentanyl analogs aren’t the only synthetic opioids claiming lives. There is no breakdown of fentanyl from the larger synthetic category number. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13070	"America’s tax code hasn’t been updated in 30 years."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/16/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-right-federal-tax-code-has-not-been-upda/	Paul Ryan clearly knows his constituents. To bring to life his ideas for tax reform, the Wisconsin congressman employed a video in which he compared the current U.S. tax code to a block of cheese. "Right now, our tax code looks like a block of swiss cheese," he said in the video posted on his website. "It’s got all these carve-outs and loopholes, and the IRS is the one calling the shots." Ryan has made clear he wants to drastically simplify the tax code. Consider this tweet posted on his Twitter account in late September: "FACT: America’s tax code hasn’t been updated in 30 years. We’re past due for a #BetterWay." With Republicans in full control in Washington, D.C., come January, many of Ryan’s ideas -- including on taxes -- may move to the front burner. If it’s been three decades since the tax code was updated, that certainly supports his case. Is he right? Remodeling or repainting? Ryan was referencing The 1986 Tax Reform Act, the second of two major tax cuts passed while Ronald Reagan was president. Enacted just over 30 years ago in October 1986, this major overhaul of the tax code took lawmakers several years to put together. They sought to simplify the tax code and redistribute the tax burden more fairly. Changes included consolidating income levels into fewer groups and closing loopholes that allowed people to evade taxes. The law lowered the tax rate for the highest earners and corporations and raised the rate for the lowest earners while eliminating from the tax roll earners below the poverty line. It’s true we haven’t seen a drastic overhaul of U.S. tax laws since then. But Ryan’s claim was the tax code hadn’t been "updated." Since 1986, the tax code has more than doubled in size. The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit group advocating for a simplified tax code, found that the tax code grew from 30,000 pages to 70,000 pages during that time. (A previous PolitiFact item confirmed Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz’s claim that the tax code is several times longer than the Bible.) A 2013 Tax Foundation analysis found the amount of credits, loopholes and deductions in the tax code increased by 44 percent since 1986. A corresponding report authored by foundation president Scott A. Hodge detailed some of the changes: "Over the decades, lawmakers have increasingly asked the tax code to direct all manner of social and economic objectives, such as encouraging people to buy hybrid vehicles, turn corn into gasoline, purchase health insurance, buy a home, replace that home’s windows, adopt children, put them in day care, purchase school supplies, go to college, invest in historic buildings, spend more on research and the list goes on." In an email, Hodge said though the code grew, the 40,000 additional pages "did not change the basic structure of the 1986 system." "It's the difference between remodeling your home and repainting," he said. "1986 remodeled the tax code, while everything since repainted it." But Ryan’s statement could easily be understood to mean the code hasn’t been touched at all, which is clearly not the case. In fact, revisions to tax code became more frequent after 1986. "There are updates to the tax code all the time," said Fabio Gaertner, an accounting professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Business who specializes in taxation. Gaertner said while it’s true there hasn’t been a major overhaul in 30 years, in his view Ryan’s use of the word "updated" goes too far. When we asked for input from the IRS, which enforces the tax code, spokesman Matthew Leas recommended we ask the Department of Treasury, which collects tax revenues through the IRS. But we didn’t hear back from either. Our rating Ryan said the tax code "hasn’t been updated in 30 years." The statement hinges on how a listener interprets the word "updated." While Ryan’s camp said he meant "reformed," the statement could just as easily be understood to mean tax law hasn’t been touched at all, when there have been around 40,000 pages worth of updates, many of which are commonly-used credits and deductions. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c96058ce-127d-4f29-8ab6-728f0501c092	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-11-16T05:00:00	2016-09-26	['None']
pomt-11019	Says Maxine Waters told CNN, "SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/05/viral-image/phony-image-alleged-maxine-waters-called-undocumen/	As the nation awaits President Donald Trump’s announcement of a nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, social media has erupted with chatter from politicians and pundits about the potential pick. Another person dominating the internet space has been U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who first made headlines on June 23, 2018, when she told protestors at a Los Angeles rally to put pressure on the Trump administration over its policy separating immigrant families at the border with Mexico. Waters has been under constant fire from conservatives — including Trump, who elevated her profile with a series of Twitter attacks — for her comments at the rally. Waters also has become a target of several false reports and internet memes. The latest example: A doctored image purporting to show her telling CNN that an "illegal immigrant" should be nominated as the next Supreme Court justice. "Waters: SCOTUS pick should be illegal immigrant," said the chyron in what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN interview with Waters. The photo was posted to Facebook on June 28, 2018, by Trump Nation, a group devoted to supporting the president. On a ticker at the bottom of the image, Waters is quoted as saying, "It’s the only way the Democrats can ever win again." In a comment accompanying the image, the post said: "... and this is why WE don't watch CNN... They are bat shit crazy! SHARE if you agree …" But, as several media outlets were quick to point out, the image is fake. The screenshot was likely lifted from an Oct. 24, 2017, interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo in which Waters explained what she had meant when she said she would "take Trump out." In the original clip, Waters can be seen wearing the same attire and jewelry — and speaking in front of the same backdrop — as in the doctored photo. She makes no mention of a judicial nominee being an immigrant. We searched Google and Nexis and could not find any credible reports indicating that the doctored image was real.

pomt-14348	Mitt Romney did not "endorse" Ted Cruz, even though he said he is voting for Cruz and urged others to do likewise.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2016/mar/24/romney-allies/romney-non-endorsement-endorsement-sorts/	Welcome to politics, where "is" is only "is" when someone says it is. Or so it seems. Just a week ago, former Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney inserted himself squarely into the current slugfest of a GOP primary via a highly publicized March 18 Facebook message, just a few days before voters in Utah, Idaho and Arizona went to the polls. Romney made no bones of the fact that he was trying to derail GOP front-runner Donald Trump. He wrote that "Trumpism" has been associated with "racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence." He ended with this: "I will vote for Senator Cruz and I encourage others to do so as well, so that we can have an open convention and nominate a Republican," Romney wrote. It certainly appeared to be an endorsement in a GOP primary contest where Romney vowed he would not endorse a candidate. He had also vowed to support the party’s nominee, regardless of who that might be. But Romney aides and "allies" stressed in news reports that this was not an endorsement. "Mr. Romney’s vote in Utah, where he owns a house in Holladay, is not an endorsement, his allies stressed," The New York Times reported. "Rather, it is part of his effort to unite the Republican Party around an alternative to Mr. Trump’ Other news outlets reported Romney’s statement as an outright endorsement of Cruz, a "sort of" endorsement or something short of an endorsement. What’s going on here? Trump certainly took it as an endorsement of Cruz. He fired back on Twitter: "Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who ‘choked’ and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!" Romney’s office declined to comment when PolitiFact contacted a spokeswoman. However, political scientists from across the country weighed in. Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, pointed out that Romney was campaigning for Gov. John Kasich in Ohio a few weeks before he urged Utah voters to support Cruz. "Essentially, Romney is telling Republicans to vote for the candidate who can beat Trump in any given state, with the clear objective to deny Trump 1,237 votes on the first ballot of the GOP convention," Sabato said. "That will create an open convention, and the probability is that someone other than Trump will be picked on a subsequent ballot." Sabato said Romney is essentially endorsing "strategic voting" but not a specific candidate. Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, agreed. "I'd call it a ‘non-endorsement endorsement,’ " Swint said. "Romney is using Cruz, who he clearly dislikes, as a vehicle to try and stop Trump. The only place that might work is Utah. Outside of that, Romney's anti-Trump actions could actually help Trump. Romney reeks of ‘the GOP establishment.’ " Nathan Gonzales of the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report said Romney and his allies are "splitting hairs." "If you publicly support and vote for a candidate and encourage others to do the same, the only thing left is to utter the word 'endorse,’ " Gonzales said. "This is a good example of why Donald Trump is leading the field because politicians and party loyalists are playing the game with an old playbook. Instead of trying to stop Trump, Romney and company are arguing with reporters over the meaning of the word ‘endorse.’ " Political scientist Steven Smith of Washington University said the nuanced approach is complex but defendable. "Romney is trying to say that his strategic recommendation (vote for Cruz) is not yet a sincere recommendation (endorsement) of Cruz for president," Smith said. "That’s complicated but reasonable." Our ruling Romney’s aides and allies tried to spin his Facebook post in which he blasted Trump and urged voters to support Cruz as something other than an endorsement. Technically, they have a point, according to political scientists. But the statement is also misleading.

pomt-06729	"As governor, [Mitt Romney] balanced the budget without raising taxes and created jobs."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/30/ed-lindsey/georgia-pol-whips-debate-romney-record/	Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is trying to gain support for his presidential bid in Georgia, and one of his chief supporters here recently offered a case for Romney’s candidacy we found quite interesting. "Georgians are suffering under the leadership of President [Barack] Obama. Mitt Romney is the candidate with the vision and experience to turn around the failing economy," Edward Lindsey, a Republican state representative from Atlanta, said in a news release pumped out Aug. 22 by the Romney campaign. Lindsey, the House majority whip, one of the most influential positions in the Georgia Legislature, added: "As governor, [Romney] balanced the budget without raising taxes and created jobs. He has the experience in both the private and public sectors to get Americans back to work." Romney, widely considered one of the Republican front-runners, is trying to make the argument that he can do a better job than Obama in managing the American economy. The candidate that makes the best argument will likely win the presidency in 2012. With that in mind, we wondered whether Lindsey is right about Romney’s record in Massachusetts. Did he balance the budget without raising taxes and create jobs? We talked briefly to Lindsey, who referred our questions about his claim to the Romney campaign. So first, let’s deal with the budget question. Romney took office as Massachusetts’ governor in January 2003. The Massachusetts economy, like much of the country, was struggling before he took office. In 2002, Massachusetts leaders passed tax increases that raised revenue by about $1 billion, said Mike Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Tax Foundation. In 2003, the money problems continued, and it was now Romney’s job to find solutions. That year, the Massachusetts Legislature balanced the budget through spending cuts and raised revenue through some revisions of the corporate tax code. Romney signed off on several other corporate tax revisions in 2004 and 2005. Those changes resulted in an additional $350 million in revenue, Widmer said. When Romney left office, Massachusetts collected about $18 billion in revenue. Were those code changes a tax increase? Romney officials call them "loopholes." Widmer refers to them as "corporate tax increases." "I don’t fault Romney," Widmer said. "I commend him and the Legislature for the balanced approach that they took." Noah Berger, president of the Massachusetts Budget & Policy Center, does not believe they are tax increases. "I think it’s fair to say that’s different than raising taxes," Berger said of the changes. The issue has been debated for years. "[Romney’s] indicating that he balanced a budget without raising taxes is misleading at best," Brian Gilmore, executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the state's largest business lobbying group, told MSNBC in 2007. "We respectfully disagree." Romney officials countered that he was trying to stop some companies from using "aggressive accounting" to reduce their tax liability. The changes, according to MSNBC, included real estate investment trust subsidiaries created by banks to hold mortgages. The parent banks received dividend income from the trusts and took advantage of deductions to lower their state taxes. Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams told us the candidate was under pressure from the Legislature, which he described as 87 percent Democrat and among the most "liberal" in the country, to raise taxes. Romney, he said several times, resisted and did not raise "broad-based taxes." We asked whether we should then consider the corporate tax code changes a tax increase. "[Romney] did not increase taxes to solve a difficult situation," Williams said. As for job creation, federal data show the number of employed Massachusetts residents grew by about 1.3 percent during Romney’s four years as governor. The job growth was greater than population growth. Critics argue Romney cannot make much of a case that he was a great job creator as governor. Massachusetts was ahead of only Louisiana, Michigan and Ohio in the percentage of job growth during Romney’s four years in office. Louisiana leaders then had an excuse for slow job growth, contending with the aftermath of a hurricane called Katrina. Some economics experts argue governors should get little credit, or blame, for job growth. Williams, the Romney spokesman, correctly noted that unemployment fell from 5.6 percent the month Romney took office in 2003 to 4.6 percent four years later. He also correctly pointed out that Massachusetts had lost jobs in each of the two years before Romney took office. Massachusetts also had about 30,000 fewer employed residents in the two years after he was no longer governor. Technically, Lindsey has a point on both parts of that specific quote. Romney did preside over an increase in job growth as governor. As past research has shown, it was smaller than nearly every other state. There was improvement, however, on the employment front when he was governor. As for taxes, Massachusetts didn’t raise the property tax rate or other traditional types of taxes during Romney’s time as governor. But he did close several corporate loopholes, which resulted in companies paying more taxes. Because the changes to the corporate tax code resulted in some businesses paying more in taxes, we believe Lindsey’s statement needed some clarification and rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15049	"Almost nine out of every 10 pennies that would be spent" turning a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 70 into a toll road "would be from folks outside Missouri."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2015/sep/29/jay-nixon/jay-nixon-says-90-i-70-toll-road-funding-would-com/	The search for money to fund infrastructure improvements has Gov. Jay Nixon open to the idea of turning a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 70 into a toll road. On Aug. 20, Nixon spoke to nearly 1,000 people at the State Fair’s 63rd annual Governor’s Ham Breakfast. After the event, Nixon took questions from reporters and shared his thoughts on turning I-70 into a toll road. Nixon said, "almost nine out of every 10 pennies" spent on the proposed I-70 toll road would come from non-Missourians. "Almost nine out of every 10 pennies that would be spent there would be from folks outside Missouri, with the federal dollars, and then (with) the folks traveling through here," Nixon said. "So you can get a road built, 90 percent (of) a brand new road, by non-Missourians, (a road) that we use a lot. ... I think that's still is something that should be looked at very carefully." The numbers Nixon cited jumped out at us, so we decided to see if he had his facts right. The journey for answers began by reaching out to Scott Holste, the governor’s press secretary. Holste said Nixon’s claim was "part of an extemporaneous answer to a reporter’s question at the State Fair." The numbers cited by Nixon for the construction revenue of I-70 would be based on tolls collected from vehicles, as well as construction funds received from the federal government, Holste said. He also provided a Missouri Department of Transportation report, which lays out tolling options for I-70. The project cost could range between $2 billion and $4 billion. The report analyzed a 200-mile stretch of I-70 from Independence, Mo. to Wentzville, Mo. (Basically, all of I-70 in Missouri outside the St. Louis and Kansas City metro areas.) No data from the report, however, aligned exactly with Nixon’s claim, but there were some interesting details about truck traffic, which Holste pointed out. "Some 70 percent of the truck traffic on I-70 originates and terminates from outside the 200-mile study limits of Independence to Wentzville – many of those originate or are destined from locations outside Missouri," the report stated. Put another way, trucks passing through this stretch continue on to somewhere else. Holste said this information suggests those trucks come from out-of-state. In addition, trucks would face a toll rate two to three times higher than the 10-15 cents per mile rate for passenger vehicles, according to the report. Add those two facts together, Holste said, and it suggests out-of-state trucks would carry a greater share of the cost a per-vehicle basis. Not 90 percent, but something. In addition to truck traffic bringing in extra dollars, Holste said the federal government will help pave the way. Under The Highway Trust Fund, the federal government is responsible for reimbursing states a certain project types. This means up to 80 percent of construction costs will be paid by funds from the federal level, Holste said. So, in theory, 80 percent of the revenue used to fund an I-70 toll road would come from the federal government. But that by itself is misleading. The transportation trust fund is dependent on fuel taxes paid in each state, which are deposited in the trust fund to pay for transportation projects. In other words, Missourians would be responsible for a portion of the funding for the trust through the gas taxes they’ve paid. We wanted to be thorough in our analysis of Nixon’s claim so we contacted Bob Brendel, the special assignments coordinator for MoDOT and a contributing writer of the original report Nixon’s office cited. When asked about Nixon’s claim, he said the best data for what we are looking for is in the MoDOT report. The data supporting out of state truck traffic comes from a study conducted between 2006 and 2009, Brendel said. The report Holste provided was prepared in 2014 to provide data to support the idea of turning I-70 into a toll road. The data paint an interesting picture for out-of-state truck traffic, but don’t touch on how much toll revenue might be paid by out-of-state or "non-Missourian" drivers if I-70 was a toll road. "To determine the percentage of traffic from out of state would require a detailed origin-and-destination study that has not been conducted," Brendel said. Brendel also pointed out another important feature about the Highway Trust Fund. The portion of money from the federal government would only reimburse Missouri for 80 percent of project work. So Missouri would only see federal money after construction is complete. Our ruling Nixon claimed that "nine out of every 10 pennies" spent on the proposed I-70 toll road would come from non-Missourians. His office later clarified that the remark was "part of an extemporaneous answer" to a question from a reporter. In reality, it’s a guess. The report Nixon’s office cited includes many interesting traffic figures, but none of them support his specific claim. And while the federal highway trust fund would cover much of the work, some of that money comes from gas taxes paid by Missourians. Nixon has a point that a toll road would bring in a good chunk of revenue from out-of-state drivers and the federal government. But 90 percent? That’s an unsubstantiated guess. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Jay Nixon	None	None	None	2015-09-29T13:57:55	2015-08-20	['Missouri']
pomt-03829	Of every "three dollars in food stamps for the needy, seven dollars in salaries and pensions (go to) the bureaucrats who are supposed to be taking care of the poor."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/19/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-70-percent-food-stamp-fundin/	Federal bureaucrats are a favorite target at CPAC, the annual conservative conference that was held March 14-17, 2013. And in her address to the conference, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., served up a doozy. How does it help the poor, she asked, when "of every dollar that you hold in your hands, 70 cents of that dollar that's supposed to go to the poor doesn't. It actually goes to benefit the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. Seventy cents on the dollar. That's how the president's caring works in practice. So three dollars in food stamps for the needy, seven dollars in salaries and pensions for the bureaucrats who are supposed to be taking care of the poor. So with all due respect, I ask you, how does this show that our president cares about the poor?" Seventy percent of the food stamp budget goes to bureaucrats rather than beneficiaries? This sounded way off to us. So we looked into it. The real numbers We first turned to budget data for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs the food stamp program. (We should point out that the food stamp program has officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008). In 2012, the Food and Nutrition Service spent a little over $112 billion, an amount that includes not only food stamps but also several smaller nutrition programs for low-income Americans. Of this, $136.5 million was spent on administration. That works out to one tenth of 1 percent -- nowhere near 70 percent. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities came up with a somewhat larger percentage on administration in a 2012 briefing paper. The center came up with administrative costs of about 5 percent by including several other categories of spending, including state administrative costs and educational programs for SNAP participants. Bachmann did mention "pensions," and if you add the retirement costs of SNAP employees it would boost the numbers a bit higher. But even the most generous accounting of SNAP’s administrative costs end up well short of 70 percent. What gives? Where Bachmann went wrong Bachmann’s office did not answer our inquiry, but experts say she probably got it from The Poverty of Welfare: Helping Others in Civil Society, a 1996 book by Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute. Tanner told PolitiFact that Bachmann is "misquoting me in a subtle but important way." In his book, Tanner cited a claim by Robert L. Woodson -- president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise and author of Breaking the Poverty Cycle: Private Sector Alternatives to the Welfare State -- that in the 1980s, 70 percent of every dollar went "not to poor people but to government bureaucrats and others who serve the poor. Few private charities have the bureaucratic overhead and inefficiency of government programs." In a footnote, Tanner added, "It is important to note that the 70 percent figure is not solely government administrative overhead. That figure also includes government payments to the non-poor on behalf of the poor. For example, Medicaid payments go to doctors. Housing subsidies are frequently paid directly to landlords." So, we see three problems here. First, Bachmann’s claim appears to be based on a 17-year-old study that cites data that may be a decade older than that. In an interview, Tanner said he quoted Woodson’s findings and then referenced a number of regional studies that reached similar conclusions. Second, the footnote makes clear that not all the people receiving federal anti-poverty money are "bureaucrats." And third, even if you assume Woodson and Tanner are correct, the finding still doesn’t apply to SNAP, which is a pure cash benefit system without payments made to intermediaries such as doctors or landlords. Our ruling Bachmann said that of every "three dollars in food stamps for the needy, seven dollars in salaries and pensions (go to) the bureaucrats who are supposed to be taking care of the poor." That is ridiculously off-base. Even the broadest calculation of administrative costs for SNAP tops out at 5 percent of program costs, far below the 70 percent Bachmann claims. And the scholar behind the statistic she appears to have used as support said Bachmann has misquoted his work. Pants on Fire!

pomt-08015	"Following the 2009 session," Texas House Speaker Joe Straus "was acknowledged and ‘thanked’ for his ‘tireless efforts’ by Planned Parenthood, the nation’s premier abortion provider."	true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/11/heidi-group/activists-say-planned-parenthood-nations-premier-a/	A letter distributed by a conservative group Jan. 4 ticks off reasons it says Texas House Speaker Joe Straus is not "pro-life," ranging from his past authorship of legislation authorizing stem-cell research to his past designation of a former Democratic legislator as chief of staff. The letter urges Republican legislators, who will have a 101-vote House majority, to deny the San Antonio Republican a second two-year stint as speaker. Straus drew 70 of 100 GOP member votes in the party's caucus meeting Monday and is expected to prevail today when the post is formally filled by the 150-member body after the session starts Tuesday. The Jan. 4 letter, signed by more than 30 anti-abortion activists, floated an unusual warning sign about Straus--involving a thank you. "Following the 2009 session," the letter says, Straus "was acknowledged and ‘thanked’ for his ‘tireless efforts’ by Planned Parenthood, the nation’s premier abortion provider." Some perspective: Planned Parenthood is a reproductive health care provider with facilities nationwide that offer family-planning services, including abortion. The organization advocates for comprehensive sexual health care and education. Carol Everett of Round Rock, a signer of the anti-Straus letter and founder and CEO of the Heidi Group, a non-profit that has run crisis pregnancy centers in Dallas advising women with unplanned pregnancies about giving birth, told us the reference to Planned Parenthood as the nation’s premier abortion provider reflected on her understanding that its clinics provide more than 300,000 of the nation’s 1.2 million legal abortions a year. She forwarded a 2009 report by an anti-abortion group, the Virginia-based American Life League, terming Planned Parenthood the largest "abortion chain" in America with 817 clinics around the country. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health, 1.2 million legal abortions were performed in the United States in 2008. Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind told us the institute doesn’t break down which groups provide abortions, but stand-alone clinics provide more abortions than all U.S. Planned Parenthood clinics combined. By our accounting, about 27 percent of abortions in the U.S. are performed at Planned Parenthood clinics versus 73 percent at other medical facilities. To our inquiry, Tait Sye of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said that in 2008-09, Planned Parenthood provided 328,000 abortions. Sye said in an e-mail: "Our health centers do much more than provide abortions. They provide a wide range of safe, reliable health care--and more than 90 percent is preventive, primary care, which helps prevent unintended pregnancies through contraception, reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections through testing and treatment, and screen for cervical and other cancers." Straus has been slammed before from the right for links to Planned Parenthood. In the early 1990s, his wife served on the board of San Antonio’s Planned Parenthood affiliate. And in 2008, before Straus was a candidate for speaker, the local group’s political arm contributed $1,000 to Straus’s campaign kitty. Everett pointed us to an article headlined "2009 Patron Party" in the fall 2009 edition of Horizons, the newsletter of the Planned Parenthood Trust of San Antonio and South Central Texas. The article says the Planned Parenthood affiliate’s president and CEO, Jeffrey Hons, thanked three legislators attending the Oct. 6, 2009, gathering at a San Antonio home, plus state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, and Straus, both in absentia, "for their tireless efforts on behalf of Texas women and children during the last legislative session." Everett said such a mention carries a taint. "If I got any mention from Planned Parenthood, people would wonder about it," Everett said. "You show one other conservative pro-lifer who has had any mention from Planned Parenthood, I would eat the paper that shows it." In an interview, Yvonne Gutierrez, spokeswoman for the San Antonio Planned Parenthood group, said Hons’ shout-out was not intended to underscore any particular action by Straus. The party was at a home in Straus’ district, Gutierrez said, and Hons "thanked the speaker because he thought that for his first session (as speaker) he did an excellent job for women and families... It was almost as if how could you be sitting in the speaker’s district talking about the legislative session and not mention the speaker?" Gutierrez said. The thanks "was really nothing more than that." The four-paragraph newsletter article focuses on more than 120 individuals whose gifts to the group exceed $1,000 a year. But the story also quotes Mindi Alterman, then the departing board chair, stressing strides the group had made in cervical cancer prevention, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and permanent birth control. The 18-page issue opens with a message from Hons describing Planned Parenthood as the city’s most effective teen pregnancy prevention program. "Finally, and perhaps as a footnote, the people who protest on the sidewalk outside my office window do nothing, absolutely nothing, to prevent so much as one teen pregnancy," his message says. "They do nothing to prevent one abortion while Planned Parenthood prevents thousands of abortions with our family planning clinics. And their protests do nothing to help vulnerable, at-risk teens keep their fragile lives pointed toward a successful adulthood." We asked Tracy Young, Straus’s communications director, for the speaker's take. She made no comment. We rate the statement True.

pomt-03180	"There’s only one candidate under investigation -- Terry McAuliffe."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/sep/03/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-under-investigation/	Confused about all charges of poor ethics that the major gubernatorial candidates are lobbing at each other? Republican Ken Cuccinelli wants to help you out. "The truth? There’s only one candidate under investigation: Terry McAuliffe," the announcer says at the start of a Cuccinelli TV commercial that’s been airing since Aug. 22. We wondered whether that is indeed the truth. The ad comes on the heels of a Quinnipiac University poll that showed McAuliffe, a Democrat, had staked out a 48-42 percent lead over Cuccinelli. The survey showed Cuccinelli is being hurt by voter doubts about his trustworthiness, the likely result of a scandal that has touched him as well as Gov. Bob McDonnell. Cuccinelli accepted $18,000 in gifts from Jonnie Williams, the chief executive of Star Scientific Inc., a nutritional supplement company. Williams was the source for more than $145,000 in gifts and loans for McDonnell and his family, most of which went unreported. Cuccinelli, in April, amended four years of personal disclosure reports he had filed with the state to include $12,000 in gifts he said he forgot to report -- including about $5,000 from Williams. Examining Cuccinelli’s ad claim requires a determination whether either major party candidate is under formal investigation. So let’s start. Is McAuliffe under investigation? Cuccinelli says his claim is based on a recent media reports about GreenTech Automotive, an electric car company that McAuliffe founded in 2009. McAuliffe quietly resigned as GreenTech’s chairman last December -- an action that wasn’t made public until April -- but continues to be a major stockholder in the struggling company. On Aug. 2, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that GreenTech is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The full scope of the probe has not been made public, but the newspapers said it focuses, at least in part, on GreenTech’s recruitment of foreign investors. GreenTech and a partner company, Gulf Coast Funds Management, sought to raise money for the electric car venture through a federal program, called EB-5, that gives permanent resident visas to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in a U.S. startup company that creates jobs. The newspapers said the SEC was examining whether GreenTech and Gulf Coast illegally promised foreign investors risk-free returns. GreenTech and Gulf Coast officials have said they have received subpoenas and are cooperating with the investigation. But McAuliffe says the SEC has not contacted him and his only knowledge of the probe comes from newspaper articles. The Post reported on Aug. 22, "there is no indication McAuliffe is personally under investigation." Cuccinelli’s campaign, in defending the ad claim, says the investigation targets a time when McAuliffe was GreenTech’s chairman. Anna Nix, a campaign spokeswoman, referred us to an article on the investigation by Breitbart.com. It quotes Douglas Park, a California business attorney, as saying that corporate board members can be held responsible for the actions of their companies and that "a good plaintiffs’ securities lawyer is going to go after" McAuliffe. Legal experts we spoke to said the facts are not clear cut. "There have been plenty of government investigations of corporations that did not involve misconduct by a high level corporate official, and plenty that have focused on misconduct by CEOs or Boards of Directors," said John G. Douglass, University of RIchmond law professor, in an email. The only way to know, he said, is when prosecutors announce who is involved. We should note that there’s a second investigation swirling around GreenTech, although Cuccinelli’s campaign did not cite it in defense of its ad. The inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security is investigating whether U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Alejandro Mayorkas gave preferential treatment to GreenTech and some other firms seeking to establish EB-5 programs. Mayorkas, who has been nominated for deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and is going through Senate confirmation hearings, has denied giving GreenTech special treatment. Records show McAuliffe and several of his business partners lobbied Mayorkas to speed consideration of EB-5 applications. But McAuliffe and officials from GreenTech and Gulf Coast Funds said they did not receive any favors and have not been contacted in the Mayorkas probe. So again, there is no evidence that McAuliffe is being personally investigated. Is Cuccinelli under investigation? Cuccinelli’s name has been tied to two probes this year. He initiated the first one on himself in April after amending his disclosure forms to include $12,000 in unreported gifts he received since lated 2009, when he was elected attorney general. Amid criticism from Democrats, Cuccinelli appointed Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Michael Herring to investigate whether he had violated state disclosure laws. Herring ended the investigation on July 18 with a nine-page report saying he found "no evidence" that Cuccinelli violated any laws or intentionally failed to disclose gifts." Two days later, PolitiFact Virginia gave a Pants on Fire to McAuliffe’s claim that the probe concluded Cuccinelli "should have been prosecuted" but Virginia’s ethics laws are too weak. The second investigation, being conducted by Virginia’s inspector general, focuses on whether a lawyer in Cuccinelli’s attorney general’s office offered legal advice to two energy companies involved in a dispute over paying royalties for natural gas they extracted from private lands. One of the companies, Consol Energy Inc., has contributed $111,000 to Cuccinelli’s campaign. The probe centers on emails Assistant Attorney General Sharon Pigeon sent to the lawyers for the energy companies. U.S. Magistrate Pamela Mead Sargent wrote in June that the emails "shockingly" show that Pigeon "has been actively involved in assisting" the companies. Cuccinelli has said that although Pigeon’s emails were "overzealous," they ethically carried out his office’s responsibility of defending the constitutionality of a state law that’s at the center of the royalties dispute. For this Truth-O-Meter, here’s the important thing to remember: Inspector General Michael Morehart has said his investigation focuses on attorneys in Cuccinelli’s office -- not Cuccinelli himself. As noted by The Post, the inspector general is not empowered to initiate investigations of elected officials. We should finally note that there are no reports that a third gubernatorial candidate -- Robert Sarvis, a libertarian -- is under investigation. Our ruling Cuccinelli said McAuliffe is the only gubernatorial candidate under formal investigation. He cites an SEC probe into the tactics GreenTech Automotive used to attracted foreign investors. McAuliffe was chairman of the electric car company until last December and remains one of its key stockholders. But there has been no indication that McAuliffe is a target of the SEC investigation. The burden of proof falls on Cuccinelli to prove his charge against McAuliffe, and he comes up empty. The good news for Cuccinelli is that we can also say that he is not the focus of any current investigations. The bad news is that we rate his ad claim False.

"Breaking: Shep Smith to be canned because he can’t control his hate for Donald Trump," said a headline by Newsflash. The website, which lacks original reporting, has a hodgepodge of articles about politics and celebrities. Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. Fake stories stating that Smith will be or has been fired have circulated since 2017 on multiple websites. Snopes, which debunked the claim in 2017, found it first published on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that calls itself satire. We rated that version of the claim Pants on Fire almost a year ago. The latest iteration of the story has been debunked by the Associated Press and Factcheck.org. We did our own reporting and came to the same conclusion that Smith’s job remains safe. One easy giveaway: Smith was just rehired. Smith, one of Fox’s original hires in 1996, is now the anchor of Shepard Smith Reporting (weekdays 3-4PM/ET). In March 2018, Fox News Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch announced that Smith, the chief news anchor and managing editor of breaking news, signed a multiyear agreement. In February, network spokeswoman Irena Briganti told the AP that the story that Smith has been let go was "completely false." Smith has drawn the ire of some Trump fans because he has criticized the president on air. Newsflash included an accurate quote by Smith in which he said Trump made a false statement that the media frequently under-reports radical Islamic terror attacks. "In short, the president’s assertion is false," Smith said in February 2017. "The White House knows that it was false or could have learned that it was false with a quick Google check, but either did not do so or decided not to tell the truth." Smith told Time in an article published in March that he’s not bothered by the divergence between his reporting and Fox’s opinion slate: "We serve different masters. We work for different reporting chains, we have different rules. They don’t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want, if it’s their opinion. I don’t really watch a lot of opinion programming. I’m busy." Bottom line: This headline is recycled fake news from 2017. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-09671	Obama "closed offshore tax safe havens."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/19/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obama-closed-offshore-tax-safe/	We got a chain e-mail recently that purports to list 90 accomplishments from President Barack Obama's first six months in office. Unlike most chain e-mails we get, this one was signed by its author, Robert Watson, a professor of American Studies at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Fla. Watson said he spoke last spring at Democratic political clubs and was asked by some members to compile the list as talking points to balance some of the claims about the Obama administration coming from Republicans. The list has since gone viral, and now Watson fields several calls and e-mails every day challenging him on some of the entries. We decided to look into a handful of items on the list to see if they check out. Here, we look at No. 46, that Obama "closed offshore tax safe havens." On May 4, 2009, the White House issued a detailed, six-page plan to curb overseas tax havens and remove tax incentives for companies to shift jobs overseas. The plan to "get tough" on overseas tax havens included eliminating loopholes for certain offshore subsidiaries; cracking down on the abuse of tax havens by individuals; and putting more resources into IRS enforcement to help close the international tax gap. And in late October, the House and Senate introduced the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2009, which seeks to crack down on Americans hiding their assets in overseas tax havens. The president promptly issued a statement in support of the legislation. "Shortly after taking office, I laid out a set of proposals to crack down on illegal overseas tax evasion," Obama stated. "The legislation introduced today would fulfill that promise, putting a stop to billions of dollars worth of abuses. I look forward to working with Congress to turn these proposals into law so that honest Americans no longer shoulder the burden of the few individuals and businesses that put profit before responsibility." Although the legislation enjoys the support of the White House, it is likely to face strong opposition from corporations that do considerable business overseas. According to a story in the New York Times , "about 200 companies and trade associations, including Microsoft Corp., General Electric Co. and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, signed a letter stating that the proposed changes to the tax code would put them at a disadvantage with their rivals." In other words, it's premature to put this one in the "Obama Accomplishments" column. Watson acknowledged as much when we spoke to him on Nov. 19. "The president started it, and Congress is now looking at it, but it's not a done deal," he said. And so we rate this one Half True.

pomt-04382	Says fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years.	true	/texas/statements/2012/oct/19/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-less-30-percent-texas-college-stud/	Rick Perry, who has said he wants the 2013 Legislature to impose a four-year tuition freeze for incoming freshmen, said at a Dallas press conference that such a move would give students an economic incentive to graduate on time. "Less than 30 percent of our students graduate in four years; only 58 percent of our students have their degrees in six years," Perry said, according to an Oct. 2, 2012, Dallas Morning News news story. "That is a system that can and must be improved." He aired a similar claim in a CBS News interview Oct. 10, 2012, saying: "One of the problems we’ve got is that only 30 percent of our college students are graduating in a four-year period of time." We previously explored a similar claim by state Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston, who said in June 2010 that about a third of Texas high school graduates who go to college end up "getting through" college. His statement rated True; our look also quoted an official from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board pointing out that 57 percent of Texas students were graduating within six years. Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said the Republican governor drew his figures from the board, and a board spokesman, Dominic Chavez, guided us to the agency’s 2012 "Higher Education Almanac." A chart in the report says 29.9 percent of Texas students who initially enrolled as full-time students in the state’s four-year public colleges and universities graduated within four years. It says 58.4 percent of full-time students graduated within six years, with 65.6 percent doing so within 10 years. Fewer part-time students graduated within the time periods. Chavez said by email that the four-year graduation rate of nearly 30 percent reflects 18,396 graduates out of 61,485 full-time students in the fiscal year running through August 2011 who had enrolled as first-time students four years earlier. Notably, he said, the state can track students who switch schools by tracking them using Social Security numbers or another identifier. And the 30 percent rate reflects improvement from the previous decade, Chavez said. By the same measure, nearly 20 percent of fourth-year undergraduates had graduated by August 2000, a rate based on 8,352 graduates among 41,925 fourth-year students. "Not only did rate go up," he said, "but the number of students increased as well." As noted in our check of Hochberg’s statement, two caveats apply. First, the data don’t account for students who enrolled in a Texas institution and then transferred out of state. Second, while the enrollment data include students who attended school out of state, the data don’t track whether they graduated. Separately, the U.S. Department of Education also gauges college graduation rates by state. In 2009, its latest figures indicate, 48.5 percent of Texas students who had enrolled six years earlier had earned bachelor’s degrees, compared with 55.5 percent nationally. The same year, 25.4 percent of Texas students who had enrolled three years earlier seeking community college associate’s degrees had succeeded, compared with 29.2 percent nationally. Based on the raw numbers behind each rate, we reached a combined graduation rate of 38 percent. In contrast to the Texas board’s calculation, the federal figures do not account for students who transferred from one institution to another. We asked Patrick Kelly, who works for the agency that oversees the federal graduation figures, to appraise the Texas board’s method of calculating graduation rates. "This makes sense," he said, calling the approach a straightforward, standard way of tracking students including those who change schools. Our ruling Perry said fewer than 30 percent of Texas college students graduate in four years and only 58 percent graduate within six years. That information is drawn from the state’s higher education oversight agency. We rate the claim as True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-10-19T11:41:22	2012-10-01	['Texas']
pomt-13193	"14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-14-percent-noncitizens-a/	One of Trump’s rallying cries as Election Day nears has been that the election system is rigged and rampant with voter fraud. We’ve debunked this idea in more than one way, but more recently, Trump offered several statistics to back his claim up during a rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on Oct. 23. One of those claims was this: "14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote." Trump’s remark stood out to us and piqued our interests. We found that Trump is referencing a study that has been criticized and rebutted multiple times for the methodology it uses. Trump’s proof was rebutted Trump was citing a 2014 article posted on Monkey Cage, a blog hosted by the Washington Post, his campaign told PolitiFact. The blog post was a precursor to a study that discussed the impact noncitizens could have on the November 2014 election. The authors — Jesse Richman and David Earnest — determined more than 14 percent of noncitizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. Richman and Earnest used data collected from a Harvard-affiliated Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). The duo concluded that CCES’ data provided "sufficient samples" to conduct their research. Trump accurately cites the study, but its findings have been highly contested. Three experts wrote rebuttals of the study’s findings after the Post article appeared, and the study spawned another peer-reviewed article. The main issue with the study is the sample size and the unreliable database of Internet respondents. Shortly after Richman and Earnest’s study was published, the CCES released a newsletter encouraging researchers not to use its data in that way. "The example for this analysis is Richman, Chattha, and Earnest (2014), which presents a biased estimate of the rate at which non-citizens voted in recent elections," the letter says. The CCES researchers — Stephen Ansolabehere, Samantha Luks and Brian Schaffner — reiterated their point in a Washington Post analysis last week. (This analysis became the subject of a study published in 2015 by the same authors.) Ansolabehere, Luks and Schaffner say a small percentage of respondents, who are citizens, accidentally misidentify themselves as noncitizens on the survey. This is because the respondents didn’t read the question carefully and accidentally selected the wrong response to the question. How do they know this? Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts, said the group has conducted surveys where they ask people questions regarding their citizenship and some people change their answers. "When we took out people who changed their answer on the citizenship question and only look at people who answered consistently that they were noncitizens, we found no reported noncitizens who voted," Schaffner told PolitiFact. News 21, a national investigative reporting project, found 56 cases of noncitizens voting across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Rick Hasen, an election expert at University of California at Irvine’s School of law, told PolitiFact that Trump’s statistic is bogus. He also cited Ansolabehere, Luks and Schaffner’s study rebutting Trump citation. Hasen wrote in the Wall Street Journal recently that "the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded last month than only a ‘tiny fraction’ of voters are noncitizens and that there is no evidence it is a serious problem." Sarah Pierce, an associate policy analyst of the U.S. Immigration Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said there are substantial legal deterrents that are in place to keep a noncitizen from voting. First, it’s a criminal offense to unlawfully vote in a federal election. Second, this offense is worthy of deportation, even without a conviction. "Voting renders an individual permanently inadmissible — again, even without a conviction," Pierce said. "This means that if someone were to be found inadmissible for having voted, they could never return to the United States, even temporarily, no matter the circumstances. Voter identification laws and regulations for registering to vote vary from state to state. In September, the Supreme Court blocked Kansas, Georgia and Alabama from requiring residents from proving they are a U.S. citizen while registering to vote, due to concerns that people who actually are citizens do not have paperwork readily available to prove it. Our ruling Trump said, "14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote." Trump is citing a study that has been refuted by the experts who actually gathered the underlying data. Trump’s remark references an unreliable data point that uses a small sample size to represent an entire population.

pomt-15181	"The United States is about 100th in voter turnout among the industrialized nations, and Texas is near the bottom in terms of voter registration and voter turnout."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/aug/21/bruce-elfant/bruce-elfant-says-us-about-100th-voter-turnout-tex/	A Travis County official declared the United States and Texas lag far behind other countries and states in voting. On Aug. 5, 2015, Democrat Bruce Elfant, the Travis County tax assessor-collector, was interviewed by Dick Ellis of the KOKE-FM Austin Radio Network about the 50th anniversary of President Lyndon B. Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act. Johnson, Elfant said, "would be very disappointed by the number of Americans who choose to use that right. The United States is about 100th in voter turnout among the industrialized nations and Texas is near the bottom in terms of voter registration and voter turnout," he said. We previously found merit to a claim that Texas had the nation’s worst voter turnout in 2014, though we noted voter statistics weren’t yet final. So, does Texas rank near the bottom nationally in voter registration and turnout? And is U.S. turnout about 100th among industrialized nations? Elfant’s backup To our inquiry, a county official, Tiffany Seward, said by email that Elfant drew the international comparison from one source and reached his conclusion about Texas from a U.S. Census Bureau survey. Seward sent along a chart, attributed to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, showing the U.S. had turnout of nearly 67 percent of registered voters in the 2012 presidential elections, placing it 97th in the world among more than 175 countries with national elections—basically tied with Montserrat, Mongolia and Bahrain. Also based on the 2012 turnout, according to the chart, the United States ranked 139th with 54 percent of its voting-age population turning out, tied with Canada and several smaller countries. The presented turnout percentages for other countries were based on elections from 2007 through 2014, according to the chart. Seward also provided a chart, drawing on bureau survey results released in July 2015, showing 59 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens were registered to vote in November 2014, placing Texas 45th among the states by that metric in a virtual tie with New York and Nevada. Nearly 35 percent of the state’s voting-age U.S. citizens turned out that November, according to the chart — about the same share turning out as in Indiana and narrowly better than turnouts in New York, Oklahoma and West Virginia, which each had 34 percent turnout. We confirmed the state-by-state figures by downloading the relevant chart from the bureau’s website which also had a report stating that nationally in 2014, about 42 percent of voting-eligible citizens turned out—the lowest rate since the bureau started asking about both voting and citizenship status in 1978. The report said the figures reflected answers to supplemental questions posed after the November 2014 elections as part of its annual Current Population Survey. According to the report, the bureau has posed supplemental post-election questions every two years since 1964. Turnout in U.S., industrialized nations Next, we turned to Elfant’s moan about U.S. voter turnout ranking about 100th among "industrialized nations." Our whoa: We’re doubtful there are 100 industrialized nations on the planet. The State Department lists 195 independent states in the world and the CIA’s World Factbook breaks out only 34 "developed countries": Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Denmark, Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holy See, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Among the developed countries identified by the CIA, U.S. turnouts have been among the lowest by two measures tracked by the International IDEA--the share of voting-age residents casting ballots by country and the share of registered voters turning out. Still, the U.S. turnout of 67 percent of registered voters in 2012 was better than such turnouts in Greece, Canada, Japan, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, San Marino and Switzerland. Also, the U.S. turnout of 54 percent of its voting-age population that year was better than such turnouts in Liechtenstein, Ireland, Austria, Switzerland, Andorra and Monaco, according to the international group, which describes itself as an intergovernmental organization, founded in Stockholm in 1995, whose mission is to "support sustainable democratic change." Asked to assess Elfant's claim, an institute spokeswoman, Lynn Simmonds, told us by email that Elfant got it right, though she added: "Please note that the label ‘industrial nations’ may cause confusion and therefore, we would say among all countries." We asked Elfant about his focus on "industrialized nations." By phone, he said he’d made a misstatement to Ellis in that he meant to roll in more countries. But "any way you slice it, we’re way towards the bottom" in voter participation, he said. Other analyses There are other ways to sort this out. Seema Shah, an institute official, advised by email that if you define voter turnout as the ratio of voters compared to the entire population of citizens eligible to vote, then for presidential elections, the U.S. lately ranks 75th (with 53.58 percent of eligible voters turning out) if you focus only on the 113 countries with presidential elections. And the institute's Peter Wolf said that if the focus is limited to the 34 countries (including the U.S.) that comprise the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, which promotes economic development, the U.S. turnout of nearly 67 percent of registered voters in the 2012 presidential elections landed in a "mid-field position"--lower than turnout, say, in New Zealand (77 percent), comparable to turnout for parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom and yet higher than than turnout in Canada (61 percent). Wolf said the nearly 43 percent U.S. turnout rate in the 2014 congressional elections was among the lowest rates for the countries. In May 2015, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center said U.S. voter turnout typically trails turnout among the other OECD member-nations. An accompanying chart showed the U.S. ranked 31st among the selected nations, based on its 2012 turnout, besting Japan, Chile and Switzerland. Among the member-countries, the highest turnouts were in Belgium (87.2 percent), Turkey (86.4 percent) and Sweden (82.6 percent). Then again, Pew noted, Belgium and Turkey are among 28 nations where voting is compulsory, according to the International IDEA; countries that require voting include Australia, Peru, Singapore and Uruguay. Drew DeSilver, who wrote the Pew analysis, told us by phone he compared turnouts in the OECD nations because they represent the world’s advanced industrialized democracies, hence amounting to reasonable peers. DeSilva added by email: "That is to say, it wouldn't make much sense to compare the U.S. to either developing-world democracies or to developed but not-so-democratic countries." Our ruling Elfant said the U.S. is "about 100th in voter turnout among the industrialized nations and Texas is near the bottom in terms of voter registration and voter turnout." Texas is nearly last among the states in voter registration and turnout and U.S. voter turnout ranks low internationally, though that's among all nations, not the limited number of countries considered industrially developed.

pomt-09333	Says he did not say Republicans would filibuster immigration reform.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/12/jon-kyl/yuma-daily-newspaper-quoted-kyl-saying-republican/	Update: After publishing this item on April 12, 2010, we received new information, including video of a town hall meeting in Yuma, a comment from Sen. Jon Kyl's staff and more information about the Yuma Sun report. We have updated this item on April 13 to fully reflect the new information. The ruling, however, remains the same -- False. What Sen. Jon Kyl did or didn't say about immigration at a town hall in Yuma, Ariz., was in dispute on ABC News' This Week. Host Jake Tapper asked Kyl, "You helped lead the cause of immigration reform in 2007. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that he is going to bring up immigration reform. You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?" "I don't think I said that, Jake, but what I did say is that the conditions for immigration reform no longer exist," Kyl said. "The consensus that existed before does not exist. And among other reasons, because the administration -- this current administration has not done what's necessary to secure the border and enforce the law. We just saw the tragic death of a rancher down on the border, presumably from drug smugglers or illegal immigrants, that simply illustrates once again the fact that we have not controlled the border. And until that's done, I think it's going to be very difficult for Congress to support legislation that would be as comprehensive as that I supported three years ago." The answer indicates Kyl is not optimistic about immigration reform, but we wanted to find out whether Kyl said Republicans would filibuster or not. Kyl made his remarks at a town hall attended by 350 people in Yuma, Ariz., on April 7, according to a report in the Yuma Sun, a daily newspaper owned by Freedom Communications. The newspaper reported the filibuster remark, though very briefly. Here's what the paper's report said: One man in the audience asked Kyl about the GOP's strategy to curtail the efforts of the Democrat-controlled Congress and executive branch. "First of all, our strategy on health care included taking as long as we possibly could so the American people could clearly understand (it).. and it took a year for it to get done," Kyl said, adding they will do their best to slow up any other bills, like immigration reform, in the same manner. "My guess is (immigration reform) won't have the votes to pass, but political promises have been made to key constituency of the party that is in power. Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster..." Kyl's remarks did not go unnoticed. The Wonk Room, a liberal blog run by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, linked to the Sun's report and noted that Kyl's remarks were "the first time a high-ranking GOP member has threatened to block reform entirely." Tapper's question -- "You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?" -- was a verbatim repeat of the quote the Sun reported. But the Sun's quotation of Kyl -- "Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster" -- is a little off. Kyl's staff provided us with a transcript and video; they said it showed more context for Kyl's statement. We reviewed the material; here's an extended version of Kyl remarks. "My guess is, neither (card check and immigration reform) will have the votes to pass. But because political promises have been made to key constituency of the party that is in power, that they're going to do something about these problems, they will bring up very partisan legislation. Republicans will, primarily Republicans, will vote it down, that is to say we will prevent it from coming up through the filibuster, through requiring cloture and they won't get 60 votes. And then they’ll be able to blame us for being anti-union or anti-Hispanic or whatever. It's false, but that’s the political game. But at least those things won't pass." On April 13, the Yuma Sun said it would run a correction on the quote. But Tapper's summary of the misquote is still a fair account of what Kyl said. And of course, there are no quote marks on broadcast television. If anything, the video makes a stronger case that Kyl believes Republicans will filibuster immigration reform, which was the premise of Tapper's question. Kyl's staff told us he only meant that Republicans would filibuster a purely partisan bill, not the kind of bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that Kyl put forward with Sen. Edward Kennedy in 2007. That's why Kyl objected to Tapper's premise. Still, Tapper's question -- "You said the other day in Yuma, Ariz., that Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster. Are you going to help with the filibuster of immigration reform?" -- remains an fair summary (though not a quotation) of Kyl's town hall remarks. The video showed that Kyl predicted a Republican filibuster. So Kyl's statement -- that he didn't say Republicans will use the opportunity to filibuster -- is False.

pomt-15272	"More than half of all drivers' licenses issued in California this year have gone to illegal aliens."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/28/numbers-usa/did-more-half-all-california-drivers-licenses-go-u/	California is home to more undocumented immigrants than any other state, over 3 million, so any policy shift it makes is bound to catch attention. NumbersUSA, a group that favors reduced immigration, noticed a trend with driver’s licenses in the Golden State and posted a meme with this message on its Facebook page. "More than half of all drivers' licenses issued in California this year have gone to illegal aliens," the meme says. The group is on solid ground with its numbers, although it omits why this has happened. According to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, about 397,000 undocumented immigrants received a driver’s license since January. "This figure represents more than half of the total 759,000 original driver licenses that have distributed during the first half of 2015," the department said in a press release. Behind these numbers is a 2013 law called the Safe and Responsible Driver Act. The measure reversed a 20-year-old law that blocked people without legal status from applying for a license. A large coalition of immigrant advocacy organizations argued that in the state that epitomizes American car culture, that ban made it difficult for people to get to work, drive their kids to school and run simple errands. The result, the advocates argued, was thousands of people on the road without licenses and without any way to make sure they knew how to drive. Under AB 60, all that would be needed to get a license was proof of residency and the ability to pass a driver’s test, both written and on-the-road. California Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill in October 2013. It took effect January 2015. A wave bigger than expected State officials predicted that about 500,000 people would apply in the first six months, with about another million people after three years. By April 2015, they had already hit the 500,000 mark. "The interest in this program is far greater than anyone anticipated," said DMV director Jean Shiomoto in a press release. Shiomoto might have been surprised, but the state had done a lot to make this happen. In January 2014, Brown proposed spending $65 million to open five temporary offices and hire as many as 1,000 additional staffers to handle an application surge. He largely got what he wanted. The department opened four new offices and hired 900 people. In November 2014, the Department of Motor Vehicles announced it would keep longer office hours and stay open on Saturdays. "DMV is committed to successfully implementing this new law to increase safety on California roads by putting licensed drivers behind the steering wheel," Shiomoto said. Our ruling The group NumbersUSA said that this year, more than half of all drivers' licenses issued in California went to undocumented immigrants. By the state’s own tally, that is correct. What the group doesn’t mention is that this is the result of a substantial state effort. First, lawmakers made it possible for over a million unauthorized residents to apply for a license, and then the state spent millions of dollars to speed the application process. The statement had the right numbers but needs additional information. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	NumbersUSA	None	None	None	2015-07-28T11:20:01	2015-07-22	['California']
pomt-14081	Since 2009, "after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/18/penny-pritzker/commerce-secretary-penny-pritzker-says-2009/	President Barack Obama has touted his administration’s record of overseeing economic growth since the Great Recession. But is it correct -- as Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker wrote recently in Medium -- that since 2009, "after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent"? To check Pritzker’s statement, we looked at two economic statistics compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which, as it happens, is part of the department Pritzker oversees. One is real disposable personal income -- that is, the accumulation of all personal incomes in the United States, minus taxes and adjusted for inflation. That statistic rose from $10.9 trillion in 2009 to $12.2 trillion in 2015, the last full year available. That works out to an increase of 11.9 percent. Here’s a summary graph: That’s lower than the 14 percent figure Pritzker cited, but it’s still a double-digit increase over six years, so it’s in the ballpark. We didn’t hear back from Pritzker’s office, but Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless said he suspects she arrived at her number through a different but reasonable calculation. He said she was probably referring to a comparison of an average of the 12 monthly figures from 2009 and the three monthly figures (so far) for 2016. We double-checked Burtless’ math and found that it works out to be a 13.7 percent increase -- on target with what Pritzker said. But while Pritzker is either correct or reasonably close when looking at the overall personal income numbers, it’s worth remembering that this number can be affected by population growth, even over a period as short as seven years. Consider an alternative measure -- real disposable personal income per capita, which is the previous statistic, but adjusted for the size of the U.S. population. That measurement has gone up from $35,616 in 2009 to $38,046 in 2015 -- an increase of 6.8 percent. That’s only half as fast as Pritzker said -- and it’s worth remembering that this was a cumulative rise over six years. As a result, disposable personal income rose by only about 1 percent a year above inflation during that period. That doesn’t sound quite as exciting. Why doesn’t this feel right to most Americans? So if Pritzker’s claim about after-tax income growth is reasonably accurate, how does that jibe with equally accurate claims noting that "Americans haven’t had a raise in 15 years"? For starters, as we’ve noted, there are various ways to measure income growth, each of them legitimate but some of them show different results. "I agree that we want to think about some sort of per-person measure, but is the right measure per capita or per employed or per labor force participant?" said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed. In addition, even if real disposable personal income is going up over time, that doesn’t mean it’s rising as fast as it once was. To measure this, we looked at the average annual increase in real disposable personal income during three recent periods. From 1992 to 2000, real disposable personal income rose an average of 3.7 percent per year. From 2001 to 2008, it rose an average of 2.7 percent per year. And from 2009 to 2015, it rose by 1.6 percent per year. That’s a clear pattern of diminishing growth, even if it’s still growth. Burtless noted that the lack of attention given to the role that rising population has warped perceptions of economic output and income growth. Specifically, he said, the slowdown in population growth since the 1970s, especially in the age groups likeliest to be working, has made it harder for the United States to reach the once-common historical level of 3 percent annual economic growth. Our rating Pritzker said that since 2009, "after-tax incomes are up nearly 14 percent." Using the most basic, aggregate measure, Pritzker is either on target or reasonably close. However, it’s worth noting that this accomplishment is not quite as impressive once you strip out population growth or look at growth levels historically. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/adb03577-9123-471c-87e4-b3383d5fddcf	None	Penny Pritzker	None	None	None	2016-05-18T13:49:28	2016-05-13	['None']
pomt-07069	"We are one of the most expensive [bus] rides in New England."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/28/charles-odimgbe/transit-ceo-says-rhode-island-bus-fares-are-most-e/	With the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority facing a projected $4.6- million budget shortfall in the coming year, CEO Charles Odimgbe told his board of directors that bus service would have to be cut 10 percent. He ruled out raising fares, something the board has done five times since 2002. "We are one of the most expensive rides in New England," Odimgbe told the board members during the meeting. Does a ticket to ride cost more in Rhode Island? We decided to find out. When we reached Odimgbe, he said he based his statement on knowledge of the industry. He later had a RIPTA employee forward an internal survey. He qualified the remark he made to his board, saying it’s more relevant to compare RIPTA to transit systems that are comparably sized and in areas with a comparable cost of living than to simply look toward other systems in New England. If you did look to Boston or New York for a comparison and took into consideration their higher cost of living, "you will come to the conclusion that the rides in Rhode Island are very high," he said. We’re not sure why cost of living should be a factor, so we focused only on how much it costs to ride the bus. In Rhode Island, the fare for riding a RIPTA bus is $2 one way. Need to transfer to another bus? That costs another 50 cents. Ride frequently? You can get a one-day pass for $6 and a monthly pass for $62. Some people, including seniors, disabled, low-income and students, can ride for free or for half price. [Of the 18.2 million rides RIPTA provided during the past 12 months, about 4.2 million, or one-quarter, were seniors and disabled people who hold free passes -- they number 40,000 -- and another 2 million were students with passes, according to assistant general manager Mark Therrien.] By comparison, in Boston, the base bus fare is $1.50, or 25 cents less with a pre-paid Charlie Card. A monthly local pass costs $40. Let’s look at some other transit systems in New England. In Portland, Maine, the fare is $1.50, with a monthly pass costing $45. The Worcester Regional Transit Authority charges $1.50, with monthly passes going for $48. In Burlington, Vt., the fare for a public bus is $1.25, with a monthly pass costing $42. Connecticut Transit, serving Hartford and New Haven among other communities, charges $1.25, with free transfers. RIPTA’s internal survey draws a comparison with a handful of comparable, or "peer" systems outside of New England. Fares were reported from last summer, but we went to their individual websites and updated those that have changed. In cities such as Albany, Rochester, Memphis, and Louisville, basic fares were lower than RIPTA’s. So far, Odimgbe’s claim seems to be holding up. But comparing only base fares doesn’t give a complete picture of what it costs to ride a bus in any of these systems. And this is where Odimgbe’s claim begins to break down. In Rhode Island, there’s one basic fare, no matter how many miles you travel -- whether it’s within Providence city limits or between outlying communities and the capital city. Get on a bus in Westerly and it will carry you the 43 miles to Providence, all for just $2. Get a transfer for another 50 cents and you could then head to Woonsocket, another 15 miles. [Odimgbe said the agency has concluded that because most RIPTA riders travel within urban areas -- an estimated 85 percent of rides within 7 miles of downtown Providence -- it would not be worth creating a system to charge long-distance riders more.] You’re not going to travel those long distances in Connecticut that cheaply. Express bus service between Hartford and outlying areas is based on zone fares that range from from $2.25 to $4.30. For example, if you board a bus in Old Saybrook or New Haven and travel the 40-plus miles to Hartford, the fare is $4.30, more than double Rhode Island’s fare for a comparable distance. Boston, meanwhile, has higher fares for its Inner Express ($3.50) and Outer Express ($5) services. Let’s make one last stop before we arrive at our destination. The American Public Transportation Association, whose members include RIPTA and 350 other transit systems conducts an annual survey of base fares for adults. Of those that responded to the 2010 survey, only four U.S. systems charged more than RIPTA, ranging from $2.25 in San Diego to $3.65 in San Francisco. So what have we learned during our ride? When we confined our comparison to New England, just as Odimgbe stated, we could not find another bus system charging as much as RIPTA’s $2 base fare. And while several of these do not charge to transfer to other buses, RIPTA tacks on another 50 cents. RIPTA’s monthly pass also is substantially higher. However, while RIPTA lets patrons travel all the way across the state for no more than $2.50, riders in Boston and Connecticut have to pay substantially more to travel comparable distances. So, Odimgbe’s claim that RIPTA is "one of the most expensive rides in New England" is true for base fares, but not when it comes to longer trips. Because 85 percent of RIPTA riders pay the base fare, we rate his claim MostlyTrue. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-07524	"Across the United States, 25 percent of voting age African Americans do not have the photo ID that this bill would require."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/07/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-one-quarter-african-a/	It’s normal for House Democrats and Republicans to have sharp divides, but last month’s heated debate over a controversial voter ID law added a new ingredient to the partisan stew: race. Democrats, including several black members of the caucus, in no uncertain terms, accused Republicans of targeting minority populations with the proposal to require all Ohioans to show government-issued ID at polling locations. Democrats saw the move in racial terms because of what they said was clear evidence black voters are more likely not to have photo IDs than white voters. Rep. Armond Budish, the House Democratic leader, implored House Speaker William G. Batchelder to not move the legislation forward. In a March 22 letter to the speaker, Budish said groups such as senior citizens, college students, poor citizens and black residents would suffer because they are more likely to not have a photo ID. "Across the United States, 25 percent of voting age African Americans do not have the photo ID that this bill would require," Budish wrote. Surely there are African-Americans in the United States who don’t have photo ID (as do a portion of every racial group), but could a full quarter of 41 million black Americans be without IDs? Politifact Ohio decided to take a look. The legislation would require voters to show one of four forms of ID when voting in person — an Ohio driver license, state ID, military ID or passport. House Republicans added a provision that would allow an expired driver license be used - a measure aimed at helping seniors comply with the ID law. The claim about 25 percent of African Americans became the underpinning for the racially-charged accusations lobbed at Ohio Republicans. Rep. Tracy Maxwell Heard, a Columbus Democrat who is black, repeated it at a news conference March 23. Later that same day, the House passed the bill along party lines. It’s now pending in the Ohio Senate. We asked Budish where Democrats got the 25 percent figure they were using to make the case that the Ohio law would impact blacks disproportionately. He cited a report from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. The report, "Citizens Without Proof," is based on a telephone survey conducted by Opinion Research Corp., an independent polling firm. It surveyed 987 randomly selected voting-age Americans over four days in November 2006. Those surveyed were asked, "Do they have a current, unexpired government issued ID with their picture on it?" Among the African Americans, 25 percent have no current government-issued photo ID, according to the survey. For white adults, the rate was 8 percent. The margin of error, the Brennan Center states, for that particular statistic is plus or minus 8 percent—meaning the actual statistic is probably between 17 and 33 percent. It was clear that one five-year-old national survey had found a quarter of African Americans without proper ID, but were there other studies of this issue? Some sleuthing in the political science academic journals turned up a 2007 study done in Georgia — one of only two states in the country with an ID requirement similar to the one proposed in Ohio — that found a much lower portion of African-Americans without photo ID. This study found that only 6.8 percent of blacks did not have a proper government-issued photo ID. However, that same study found that 3.7 percent of white adults in Georgia did not a photo ID — a finding that tended to support the outrage from Ohio Democrats that the proposed law would disproportionately targeting black adults. A study from Wisconsin found much higher percentage of black adults without state ID. Statewide, 80 percent of men and 81 percent of women had a valid drivers license, the study found. But only 45 percent of black males and 51 percent of black females had a driver’s license or other form of state ID PolitiFact Ohio checked with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles for information on how many black Ohioans have driver’s license or state IDs, but the bureau does not track individuals by race. So add it up and what do we have? A national study did find 25 percent of African Americans don’t have the kind of government-issued photo identification, such as a driver’s license or passport, that the Ohio proposal would require. But the study has a sizable margin of error -- 8 percent -- and that it was done in 2006. It may be the most current research available, but Budish’s statement was made in the present tense about data that is five years old. Budish was using the national statistic to argue that the new law would disproportionately impact potential black voters in Ohio. Yet there has been no study of this issue in Ohio so there are no specific figures for the state population. ID rates in other states where studies were done differed greatly. So while Budish’s statement is accurate, it leaves out those important details needed to understand it in full context. On the Truth-O-Meter that rates as Half True.

pomt-10992	Since 2014, "each year, (NATO) nations have been increasing their contributions."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/john-kerry/john-kerry-rebuts-trump-nato-spending-was-not-down/	Former Secretary of State John Kerry took exception to President Donald Trump’s criticism of the NATO allies at the recent meeting in Brussels. Trump came into the meeting saying the European members needed to spend more. At a news conference after the meeting, Trump said their defense spending had been falling. "It was going down, the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially, and now it's going up very substantially," Trump said. Kerry said the trend was just the opposite. "President (Barack) Obama raised the issue in a constructive and collegial way that succeeded in securing a pledge from NATO members to increase their defense spending," Kerry said in a statement July 11. That meeting took place in 2014 in Wales. At the end, NATO members said they would spend more on defense and "aim to move towards the 2 percent guideline within a decade." "Each year, (NATO) nations have been increasing their contributions," Kerry said. The European nations had reasons beyond Obama to up their defense game. Open fighting in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists had Europe on high alert. Whatever motivated the Europeans, the numbers say Kerry is right, at least for the time frame he mentioned. Since 2014, the European members collectively increased defense spending by 8 percent, or $20 billion in real terms. (Canada’s spending also rose by $7 billion.) This chart draws from official NATO statistics, with all amounts in constant 2010 U.S. dollars. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Now, it is true that before 2014, Europe had been spending less, but that isn’t what Trump said. Trump said spending was going down when it was rising. In relative terms, the European share of all NATO member defense spending has been rising since before 2014. In 2012, its share stood at 27 percent. That fraction increased every year, reaching 30 percent in 2017. Defense analysts at the conservative Heritage Foundation see the data the same way. Luke Coffey and Daniel Kochis said while non-U.S. spending needs to go higher (as did Kerry), they also said it has been headed in the right direction. "In 2017, NATO members (not including the U.S.) collectively increased spending by 4.8 percent, or $23 billion, since 2015," Coffey and Kochis wrote June 26. NATO broke from its usual practice and issued a projection of 2018 defense spending at the end of the recent gathering. That report shows Europe’s collective spending rising by about $35 billion in current dollars, while U.S. spending would go up by about $20 billion. Our ruling Kerry said that NATO members have been increasing their contributions. Total defense spending by the European members rose 8 percent or $20 billion dollars from 2014 to 2017.

Gone are the fancy airplane rides for nothing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/barack-obama/a-player-but-not-the-captain/	(Published Oct. 30, 2008) From the start of his presidential bid, Democratic nominee Barack Obama has touted ethics as a major campaign theme. He barred lobbyists and corporate political action committees from contributing money to his campaign, for example, and fairly or not he's repeatedly assailed his Republican rival's ties to lobbyists. But the Illinois senator's oft-repeated theme that he led the effort to pass ethics reform legislation in the Senate last year is much exaggerated, as we pointed out last spring . Obama's 30-minute infomercial made the claim again on October 29, 2008, quoting Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill. "He's changed the rules in Washington," McCaskill said during the half hour campaign commercial that ran on major broadcast networks and cable channels. "Gone are the free gifts from lobbyists. Gone are the fancy airplane rides for nothing. He did that." It's clear what McCaskill is referring to here: the 2007 ethics reform law that Congress passed and President Bush signed in the wake of the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal. And to be sure, Obama backed the 2007 law, which barred gifts from lobbyists and required that a senator flying on a corporate jet reimburse the plane's owner at the full charter rate. (Senators didn't previously fly free, as McCaskill claims, but rather were required to pay whatever a first class ticket on a commercial airline would have cost for the same route.) But Obama was not the leading player on the new law. Obama was most active on the issue a year earlier, when he was tapped by Democratic party leaders in early 2006 to lead the party's efforts on lobbying reform in the wake of the scandal created by Abramoff, a longtime Washington lobbyist for Indian tribes who pleaded guilty in January 2006 to conspiring to bribe members of Congress. Obama proposed setting tougher rules for the disclosure of earmark requests and creating an outside ethics office, staffed with independent monitors, to evaluate complaints against senators. But Obama was not pleased with what the Senate came up with and in March 2006 he was one of just three Democrats to vote against legislation, which ultimately passed 90-8, by then-GOP Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi that would have made it more difficult to add earmarks to spending bills, required members of Congress to wait two years after leaving public office to lobby their former colleagues and banned gifts from lobbyists. Obama said Lott's bill was not tough enough. In the end, the House and Senate were not able to reconcile their differing versions of the legislation and Lott's bill died. When Democrats took control of both chambers in January 2007, they moved quickly to pass ethics reform legislation, but most of the legwork was done by Obama's Democratic colleagues, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. They negotiated the final legislative language and moved it through both chambers in defiance of skeptical Republicans. During the 2007 debate, Obama was a less central player than he had been in 2006. Though he supported the gift ban, he was not its most vocal backer. In 2007, he continued to push, unsuccessfully, for an independent ethics office and, with Democratic colleague Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, drafted the provision on corporate jets that was ultimately incorporated into the final bill. On that score, then, McCaskill is right. But to imply Obama was the leading force behind the 2007 ethics law goes too far. For that reason, we rate McCaskill's statement Half True.

pomt-11136	New York state has the "second highest millionaires tax in the nation."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2018/may/31/christine-quinn/does-new-york-state-have-second-highest-tax-wealth/	New York state ranks only behind California for taxing the rich, Christine Quinn said at the Democratic Party’s state convention on Long Island. "Second-highest millionaires tax in the nation, highest on the East Coast, only behind California but we'll find a way to beat them, too," Quinn, vice chairperson of the New York State Democratic Committee, said to applause from the party’s delegates. When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took office in 2011 he was staunchly opposed to the tax on the state’s highest earners. He, like Republicans, thought it would prod high-income residents to leave the state and lead to less income-tax revenue. Cuomo, however, has since fought to preserve the tax. He repeated Quinn’s claim in his speech at the convention. "Our millionaires tax is the second-highest in the nation and the highest in the East," Cuomo said. New York state has a reputation as a high-tax state. But does the state have the second-highest millionaires tax rate in the nation? The millionaires tax In 2009, state lawmakers and then-Gov. David Paterson raised the state income tax rate from 6.85 percent to 8.97 percent for earners making $500,000 or more. The tax, intended to help close the state’s deficit, was supposed to expire after three years. Cuomo and state lawmakers agreed to extend the so-called "millionaires tax" before it ended, but lowered the rate to 8.82 percent for people making about $1 million or more. They eliminated the higher rate for filers making less. The top rate remains at 8.82 percent in 2018. Democrats in the Assembly have proposed setting even higher rates for people making more than $5 million annually. Republicans oppose that proposal. Other states Some residents of New York State — but not all — pay the second-highest income taxes in the country. Some cities in New York state, like New York City, collect their own local income tax on top of the state tax. Neither Quinn nor Cuomo made reference to the city in their speeches. The highest earners in New York City pay a local income tax of 3.876 percent. That applies to single filers making more than $50,000 a year and married filers making more than $90,000. That rate was already in place before Cuomo took office. The combined state and local income tax rate in New York City is 12.7 percent for people who make about $1 million or more. That’s less than California’s 13.3 percent state income tax rate, but more than the rates in the other states. We couldn’t find another city in the U.S. with a higher combined state and local income tax rate. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, confirmed that New York City residents pay the second-highest combined rate behind California. Quinn’s claim doesn’t hold up outside New York City. Seven states have higher income tax rates on wealthy earners, according to research from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, a tax policy analysis group. Auxier confirmed that finding. California is highest, but two of New York state’s neighboring states also have higher tax rates on the wealthy. Vermont taxes people who make more than $416,650 at 8.95 percent and New Jersey taxes those making more than $500,000 at 8.97 percent. In the Midwest, Iowa and Minnesota tax their highest earners at 8.98 percent and 9.85 percent, respectively. Oregon’s highest rate is 9.90 percent and Hawaii reinstated an 11 percent state income tax for wealthy earners this year. New York state and California are the only two states with an isolated tax bracket for filers who earn about $1 million or more. The highest brackets in the other six states start lower, from $71,190 to $500,000. Washington D.C., while not a state, also has an income tax bracket for filers making $1 million or more, and they are taxed at 8.95 percent. No one from the State Democratic Committee offered an on-the-record explanation supporting Quinn's claim. Our ruling Christine Quinn said New York state has the "second-highest millionaires tax in the nation." That’s only true for New York City residents. Millionaires outside New York City have a lower rate than those in seven other states. Her claim contains an element of truth about New York City. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01723	Austin mayoral candidate "Mike Martinez takes corporate money."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/aug/07/eugene-sepulveda/adler-supporters-mike-martinez-money-claim-unsuppo/	A supporter of an Austin mayoral candidate declared that another candidate accepts corporate donations--which would be illegal, he did not add. In a July 29, 2014, Facebook post, Eugene Sepulveda of Austin, treasurer for attorney Steve Adler’s mayoral campaign, declared Adler isn’t taking "corp money, PAC money or bundled contributions," meaning money gathered from multiple sources by a single person. Commenting below Sepulveda’s post, Austin political consultant Mark Littlefield, who supports City Council member Mike Martinez for mayor, asked: "Are other candidates taking corporate money?" Sepulveda replied: "Mike Martinez takes corporate money. Steve won’t." A Martinez backer, Jose Velasquez, asked us to check Sepulveda’s claim. We wondered first if perhaps laws have changed dramatically so that Texas candidates may accept corporate donations. Not so, we were reminded, in that Texas adopted its ban on corporate donations to candidates more than a century ago. A September 2013 Texas Ethics Commission guide for candidates for local office specified that state law bars contributions to candidates for state and local office from labor unions and most corporations. More recently, Austin lawyer Tim Sorrells, the commission’s former general counsel, advised candidates for city office in an April 2, 2014, blog post: "In Texas, it is still a felony of the third degree for a corporation or labor organization to contribute directly to a candidate or a candidate committee." We asked Sepulveda, a social entreprenuer and philanthropist, to elaborate on his Facebook statement. By email, he told us: "I should have said Mike was taking money from business entities. I was referring to his acceptance of contributions from LLCs as well as PACs and bundlers." LLCs are Limited Liability Companies. "My bad for not being more specific," Sepulveda wrote. In another email, he said that when Velasquez asked him about the corporate claim, "I used the term corporate generically, even referring him to the documents filed with the city clerk. If I'd been trying to mislead anyone, I certainly wouldn't have pointed them to the candidate-filed reports." Sepulveda, who said he made his Facebook comments as an Adler supporter and not as a spokesman for Adler’s campaign, elaborated that according to a campaign-finance filing, Martinez fielded contributions from 13 businesses, which we confirmed from Martinez’s July 15, 2014, campaign finance report, which showed the cited contributions ranging from $50 to $350. We noticed the business contributors included several limited liability companies, which prompted us to ask an election-law expert, Trey Trainor of Austin, if such companies can legally give to candidates for local office. By phone, Trainor said LLCs may legally make donations so long as none of their members are corporations. Also by phone, Austin lawyer Ed Shack, who said he has helped Adler’s campaign, said the same. Martinez campaign spokesman Nick Hudson told us the campaign earlier confirmed from state records and by contacting each contributor that none of the LLCs giving to Martinez’s effort had corporate members. Hudson agreed it would be illegal for Martinez to accept corporate donations. Meanwhile, Sepulveda replied to us that he had since posted a comment on Facebook, below his original claim, stating he should have said Martinez accepted donations from business entities including LLCs rather than corporations. It appeared the afternoon of Aug. 4, 2014. Our ruling Sepulveda said on Facebook that Martinez takes corporate donations. That’s not so. In fact, corporate donations remain forbidden and accepting such could lead to a felony charge. However, any candidate may field contributions from PACs and LLCs (so long as a donor LLC has no corporate members). This advocate’s claim, which he clarified on Facebook six days later, shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-02754	Under President Obama’s health-care reforms, the premium for "an average plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500 per year, it's gone up about $2,500 per year."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/15/ron-johnson/obamacare-health-insurance-premiums-havent-gone-do/	When it comes to statistics, chart-loving U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson seems like the guy who tries to get his comb-over just-so before he goes out for the evening. Meticulous. But the Wisconsin Republican wasn’t pointing to any charts (that we could see) on Dec. 5, 2013 when he did a Fox News Radio interview about one of the federal laws he most likes to skewer: The Affordable Care Act. "It’s not affordable," Johnson stated on "Kilmeade and Friends" before making this claim about health insurance premiums. "An average (annual) plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500, it's gone up about $2,500." So, Johnson is saying that premiums are $2,500 more in 2013 than when Obamacare became law in 2010, and linkin the law to the increase. Let’s give the senator’s claim a fine-tooth examination. Down $2,500 When Johnson said premiums didn’t go down, he was referring to a promise made by candidate Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign. Obama pledged to sign a health care bill into law that would "cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year." PolitiFact National rated that a Promise Broken. Now let's see what happened to premiums. Up $2,500 In saying the annual premium has gone up $2,500, Johnson’s office cited figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group. More specifically, we’re looking at the size of the premium for an employer-sponsored family plan -- that is, the total premium paid by the employer and the employee. About 60 percent of Americans under the age of 65 get their health insurance from their employer. Here are the national averages from Kaiser for the past 10 years. Year Annual family health insurance premium Percentage increase 2004 $9,950 -- 2005 $10,880 9.34 2006 $11,480 5.51 2007 $12,106 5.45 2008 $12,680 4.74 2009 $13,375 5.48 2010 $13,770 2.95 2011 $15,073 9.46 2012 $15,745 4.46 2013 $16,351 3.85 (Note: Kaiser says that based on the way its survey of employers is done, it rounds when referring to percentages. For example, Kaiser would say the increase from 2004 to 2005 was 9 percent.) So, as Johnson indicated, the average annual premium was $2,581 higher in 2013 than when the Affordable Care Act was adopted in 2010. But premiums rose each year before Obamacare, too. Why up $2,500? Johnson policy advisor Patrick McIlheran told us the senator was merely observing in the radio interview that premiums had risen in spite of Obama's promise. But implicit in Johnsons' claim is that Obamacare, to some extent, is responsible. The Kaiser figures show a premium increase of 9 percent in 2011, about a year after the health reform law was adopted. But one could argue that the longer the law has been in effect, the lower the premium increases have been (under 5 percent in 2012 and under 4 percent in 2013). Experts say, however, that a number of factors -- including the recession and the sluggish economic recovery -- affect premiums. Moreover, there is no consensus that enough time has passed to determine what effect the Affordable Care Act -- much of which doesn’t even take effect until 2014 -- has had on premiums, particularly for employer-sponsored plans. The president’s Council on Economic Advisers, in a November 2013 report, argues there is a connection between the law and a slowdown in health care costs overall. But the report also notes "the causes of the slowdown are not yet fully understood." Health economist Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told us increases in premiums have slowed, "but I’m one of those people who thinks that has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act." And when The Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post, did a factcheck in September 2013 about Obamacare and premiums, he said the law’s impact "is just now being calculated, adding: "Trust us -- no one really knows yet." So, whether Obamacare has helped raise, or kept a lid, on premiums remains largely unknown. Our rating Johnson said that under Obama’s health-care law, the premium for "an average plan for a family didn't go down by $2,500 per year, it's gone up about $2,500 per year." Johnson is correct that by 2013, three years after the Affordable Care Act became law, the total average premium for employer-provided family insurance had risen by $2,500 per year. But experts say there is little or no evidence that Obamacare is responsible. We rate Johnson’s statement Half True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2013-12-15T05:00:00	2013-12-05	['None']
pomt-13533	"Inner-city crime is reaching record levels."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-inner-city-crime-reaching-recor/	Aiming to blunt an overwhelming edge among African-American voters, Donald Trump has been decrying longstanding black support for Democratic politicians, who he blames for allowing economic inequality and crime to fester in African-American communities. In an Aug. 29, 2016, tweet, Trump wrote, "Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on!" Is Trump correct that "inner-city crime is reaching record levels"? No, not even close. Record levels? There is no official category -- or even a definition -- for "inner-city" crime. So the best we can do is look at crime in large cities. Among the crime data the FBI collects is for that committed in cities over 250,000 in population, so that’s what we used. The chart below shows the rate of all violent crimes -- including homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults -- committed per 100,000 people, which is a standard way of measuring the extent of crime. The top line shows the rate for cities over 250,000 in population, while the lower rate shows it for the country as a whole. The two lines track each other fairly well, but the trend is unmistakable: The frequency of violent crime has declined since the early-to-mid 1990s. We also looked at one subset of the violent crime rate -- the homicide rate -- for both the country as a whole and for cities over 250,000 in population. The patterns for homicide are the same as they are for violent crime generally -- they have been declining since the early-to-mid 1990s. The same pattern holds for the subset of the nation’s very largest cities -- those of 1 million or more residents. In 2014, the violent crime rate in these largest cities was 658.7 per 100,000 residents, a significant decline from 868.9 in 2006 (and even higher in earlier years). Over the same period, the murder rate in these cities fell from 12.3 per 100,000 residents to 7.4 per 100,000 residents. A cursory look at a few specific cities shows that the number of murders, even at their somewhat elevated rate today, are well below their peaks in the 1990s. The number of murders in New York City, for instance, fell from 2,262 in 1990 to 1,927 in 1993, 629 in 1998 and 352 in 2015. And in Chicago, there were 468 murders in 2015, well below the 925 recorded in 1991, according to the Wall Street Journal. The recent spike in crime We should note that even if crime isn’t hitting record levels, there is growing evidence that there has been a one-year uptick, at least in certain cities. Trump’s supporters have seized on this as evidence that Trump isn’t totally off base in claiming that crime is on the rise. Some background: In early June, we gave Trump a Pants on Fire for his statement that "crime is rising," noting that he had made a sweeping statement while ignoring the consistent and long-term decline cited above. Critics took issue with our rating, citing preliminary figures for 2015 that showed crime rising. Scholarly research published since our original fact-check suggests that the uptick is indeed notable. Later in June, the National Institute of Justice -- an office within the U.S. Justice Department -- released a paper that analyzed the uptick. It was written by Richard Rosenfeld, who studies crime at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. Rosenfeld found that the preliminary increase in homicides "was real and nearly unprecedented." But he also added that it was not universal in the nation’s big cities. Only certain cities seemed to see significant increases. Specifically, he found that 10 out of the 56 large cities he studied "produced two-thirds of the big-city homicide increase in 2015." Most cities either showed small increases or declines. Here is a chart he assembled showing how big or small a spike each of the cities experienced: Rosenfeld found that the 10 cities with the biggest spikes tended to have higher poverty rates, higher African-American populations and smaller Hispanic populations. However, he wrote that beyond that, there is insufficient public data available at this time to determine the precise cause, or mix of causes, for the top 10 cities’ homicide spikes. In any case, none of this supports Trump’s more recent statement that crime is approaching "record levels." Even if the recent spike proves durable, the rates of homicides and violent crime in general have fallen so much in the past 25 years that the recent increases will not push them up to "record" levels at any time in the near future. "The increase in crime in inner cities in 2015 was a large one-year increase, but you can see that the long-term trend is way down," said Alan Lizotte, a criminologist at the University at Albany. "The recent spike would need to continue for a while to reach early 1990s levels." "Inner-city crime rates are not even close to record levels," agreed James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist. "And crime rates among African-Americans, especially youth, were much, much higher in the early 1990s." Our ruling Trump said that "inner-city crime is reaching record levels." Criminologists say that it is worth watching the recent jump in homicides in certain big cities to see whether it represents a lasting trend or just a blip. However, the homicide rate and the violent crime rate has fallen to such an extent over the past quarter century -- both in big cities and in the country at large -- that it would take many years of significant increases to return to the "record levels" of the early 1990s. We rate the statement Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47151ed3-abf3-4b0c-9021-db2c19f155e6	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-30T11:08:00	2016-08-29	['None']
pomt-02128	With only 67 bills or so passed into law, "2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping record."	true	/texas/statements/2014/may/09/joaquin-castro/congress-propelled-fewer-bills-law-2013-lowest-pro/	U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro bemoaned inaction in Washington, D.C., in a public breakfast interview with the McAllen Monitor. On April 24, 2014, the first-term San Antonio Democrat told Carlos Sanchez, the newspaper’s editor, that after spending 10 years as a state legislator, he was struck by the slow pace of Congress in his rookie year there. Castro said that "if you look at 2013 in terms of the productivity of Congress, one of the most striking things to me was how each of us ... 535 members of Congress can be very busy during the day ... but at the end of it all not very productive. That was a very strange thing to grasp. 2013 was the least productive year in congressional history since we’ve been keeping records." Castro continued: "Harry Truman in the 1940s campaigned against a ‘Do-Nothing Congress’ and that ‘Do-Nothing Congress’ passed over 900 bills. Congress last year passed 67 or so. So that gives you a sense of the context and the environment which I came into, which I experienced in that first year." Castro had made the same claim just before President Barack Obama gave his latest State of the Union address, according to a Jan. 27, 2014, entry on the Business Insider blog, which also quoted Castro calling the current Congress "the most gridlocked in American history." "Most gridlocked" strikes us an uncheckable opinion. We asked Castro instead about his "least productive" assessment. By email, Castro spokeswoman Laura Zapata provided an audio clip of Castro’s statement at the breakfast, which we used to transcribe what he said. Castro’s staff confirmed the unproductivity of Congress in 2013, Zapata said, after news reports said as much. She said Castro specified 67 bills passing into law because a few other successful proposals simply re-named buildings. Zapata also pointed out an undated chart published by USA Today attributed to information from the U.S. House Clerk’s Office. The chart indicates that through late December 2013, the 113th Congress had passed 72 measures into law. At a glance, the chart suggests that count was lower than any year going back to 1947 when, the chart says, 395 laws came to be. The National Journal reported Dec. 19, 2013, the year's output amounted to the tiniest fraction of 6,366 bills introduced by lawmakers, according to House and Senate records, adding "fodder to the narrative building in recent years that" Congress "has become a dysfunctional, polarized, overly partisan legislative body." Next, we turned to the website for the clerk’s office, which offers one-page detailed numerical recaps of each year’s congressional proceedings dating back to 1947. According to the web page for 2013, 73 measures made it into law through the year. That was a low compared to previous low-end years including 1995 (88 bills passed into law); 2011 (90); 1981 (145); 1969 (190) and 2012 (193), according to the clerk’s web pages. Our ruling Castro said Congress in 2013 had its least productive year since 1947, advancing 67 bills or so into law. Some 73 bills made it into law in 2013, which was the least by 15 for any year since 1947. We’re taking no position on whether this production was good or bad. Castro’s by-the-numbers' claim is True.

pomt-05061	"Two thirds to three quarters of people without [health] insurance in Rhode Island work."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jul/08/elizabeth-roberts/ri-lt-gov-elizabeth-roberts-says-two-thirds-three-/	For better or worse, health-care changes are on the way. During the June 29, 2012, edition of Rhode Island Public Television's "A Lively Experiment" program, Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts, who is helping to implement the federal program in Rhode Island, said most of the uninsured Rhode Islanders who will benefit are working people. "Two thirds to three quarters of people without insurance in Rhode Island work, but don't have access to affordable health insurance," she said, pegging the number of uninsured Rhode Islanders at about 120,000. We wondered whether most of the people who don't have insurance are, in fact, getting a regular paycheck. We called Roberts' office and asked for the source of her information. Spokeswoman Maria Tocco quickly sent us to a reliable source: StateHealthFacts.org, a website of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which compiles data on health coverage gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. The survey asks questions every year about who has health insurance and whether they are working. The most recent state data are from 2010. When the elderly were excluded (they are covered by Medicare), the Census Bureau found that 119,100 Rhode Islanders were without health insurance, essentially the 120,000 number cited by Roberts. The Census Bureau also found that 77 percent of the uninsured are from families in which at least one person has a part-time or full-time job. The remaining 23 percent are from families where nobody is working. Because that 77 percent includes children and adults who aren’t working at all, the actual percentage of workers who are uninsured is less than 77 percent -- probably significantly less. As Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller noted, insurance is often sold by family unit, which is why the numbers are framed that way. Koller sent us to another source, a 2010 "Study of Rhode Island's Uninsured" done by the consulting firm Mathematica Policy Research. It estimated that in 2010 there were 103,400 uninsured Rhode Islanders age 20 to 64. That included 49,600 people (or 48 percent) who were employed, significantly less than Roberts' estimate. The remaining people make up two groups, 22,000 (21 percent) traditionally classified as unemployed and 31,800 "not employed" (31 percent). Project director Deborah Chollet said the "not employed" group consists of people who are not looking for work, such as early retirees, people who regard themselves as too disabled to do their job, or parents staying home to care for a child while the other parent works. Koller said the best numbers are probably from the census because they use data that are more recent and they're not extrapolated, as the Mathematica numbers are. "The point that we're trying to make is that the uninsured are people who are working. They're in working situations," said Koller, the health insurance commissioner. "It's not that they're layabouts or something like that. They're working and they don't have access to it, or they have access to it and they can't afford it." Our ruling Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts said, "Two thirds to three quarters of people without [health] insurance in Rhode Island work." Unfortunately, none of the data precisely match up with the way she cast her statement. The Kaiser numbers Roberts cited to support her claim represent families, not individuals. The Mathematica study showed far fewer working people without insurance, but it's based on a projection using older data. In cases where the facts don't precisely match up with the statement, PolitiFact tries to use the data that are available and triangulate to get the truth. Roberts' larger point, that a lot of Rhode Islanders without health insurance are working people, is true. But she gave a range of two thirds to three quarters -- 67 percent to 75 percent. The Rhode Island studies we consulted suggest the true number is higher than 48 percent but lower than 77 percent. We rate her statement as Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

With the help of unflattering photographs and excerpts from newspaper articles, the mailer aired the dirty laundry of her three biggest primary opponents. One was the race's behemoth: state Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine. With his deep campaign coffers, name recognition and high polling numbers, Oxendine has long been considered the campaign front-runner. Handel's mailer hits Oxendine right where it hurts: his ethics. "John Oxendine is under a state ethics investigation because he illegally funneled more than $120,000 to his campaign from shady insurance political action committees in Alabama," it said. Oxendine's run-in with the State Ethics Commission is renown. The commission has been mulling the legality of those campaign contributions ever since The Atlanta Journal-Constitution broke the story in May 2009. Since then, Republicans have said that should Oxendine win the July 20 primary, the party may lose its grip on the governor's seat. But is it correct to call what Oxendine did "illegal"? Oxendine's troubles began with 10 campaign contributions made in late 2008. The $120,000, which is about 10 times what state rules allow, was given by 10 Alabama political action committees set up by Donald V. Watkins, a director of State Mutual Insurance. Oxendine regulates State Mutual and its subsidiary Admiral Life Insurance Co. of America. Both headed by Delos "Dee" Yancey III, a prominent businessmen who is one of Oxendine's friends. The problem is that Georgia's Ethics-in-Government Act prohibits officials from taking money directly from companies that they regulate. It also bans using multiple PACs to skirt contribution limits of $12,200 per candidate in an election cycle. Oxendine returned the money and maintains he did not violate the law. His campaign declined to comment. The accusations are real, but whether they are true is far from settled, said Tom Plank, the commission's legal counsel. Typically, the commission holds a preliminary hearing where members vote on whether there are "reasonable grounds" to think the accused violated the Ethics-in-Government Act, Plank said. If there are, an administrative judge hears the case and issues a written ruling. If there's reason to believe the violation was willful, the case can be booted to criminal court. The defendant is prosecuted on a misdemeanor charge, Plank said. Proceedings for Oxendine's case are in their early stages. State Mutual filed suit in Superior Court of Fulton County accusing members of the commission of political bias. A judge barred the commission from holding a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 24, and it has since decided against holding a hearing before the July 20 primaries. This means the commission has yet to decide whether the case against Oxendine has enough merit to go before a judge. Still, the Handel campaign stands behind its statement. "Just because he hasn't been convicted yet doesn't mean he didn't break the law," Handel campaign manager Dan McLagan said. But it doesn't mean he broke the law, either. The bulk of Handel's statement is accurate. Oxendine is under a state ethics investigation. It does concern $120,000 worth of questionable campaign contributions that came from Alabama PACs. Those PACs were set up by the director of two insurance companies regulated by Oxendine and headed by Yancey, one of his friends. But stating as a fact that Oxendine "illegally funneled" money is incorrect. Handel's mailer said a violation took place even though the commission has yet to vote on whether the case has merit. No judge has been assigned to the case, much less issued a ruling. If the mailer said Oxendine was "accused" of illegally funneling money it would have been correct. But it didn't. We rate Handel's statement Half True.	None	Karen Handel	None	None	None	2010-07-12T06:00:00	2010-06-28	['Alabama']
pomt-04504	Because of Obamacare, "over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-said-health-care-premiums-went-slower-any-ti/	Mitt Romney likes to say that if he’s elected, he will repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law "on day one." During the Oct. 3, 2012, presidential debate, he predicted what would happen if he isn’t elected: The Affordable Care Act would take full effect in 2014 and "health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family." That prompted the following response from Obama: "The fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we're already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate." For this fact-check, we’re focusing on Obama’s claim that, "over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years." We’ll also examine whether Obama was correct to suggest this slowing in premium growth is connected to reforms in his health care law. Health care spending -- not premiums -- grew slower than at any time in 50 years Obama’s statement about historically low growth is rooted in a real study. Economists from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published a report in January 2012 that said health care spending grew less in 2009 and 2010 than any time in 51 years. Preliminary estimates for 2011 show the same trend. But Obama got himself into trouble by saying "premiums" instead of "total health care spending." It’s not his first time, either. We dealt with this linguistic confusion before when we evaluated Obama’s pledge to reduce health care premiums for the typical family by $2,500 -- a Promise Broken on the Obameter. Using Project Vote Smart, a database of public statements by politicians, we found evidence of Obama using the two terms interchangeably, which is a mistake. Premiums, what people pay to buy health insurance coverage, are only one part of health care spending. Total health care spending includes out-of-pocket costs such as copays, coinsurance and deductibles; depending on the insurance plan, some medical services and physicians aren’t covered at all. It’s worth noting that evidence exists to back up the part of Obama’s claim about premiums. A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group, found slowing growth in the cost of premiums. Dr. Drew Altman, president and CEO of Kaiser, called annual growth in premiums -- along with total health care spending and per capita spending -- "strikingly low." The Kaiser survey, however, goes back 14 years, not 50. Credit the recession, not Obamacare We also wondered: Are premiums and total health spending growing at slower rates because of Obama’s health care law? Obama characterized the slowing growth of premiums as "progress" and mentioned rebates -- a piece of the Affordable Care Act -- in the same breath. We asked for an assessment from Dr. Bradley Herring, a health economist who teaches a course on the history of U.S. health reform at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. "I don’t think it’s fair for one to attribute that slowed growth in healthcare spending to the ACA," Herring said. "Most health economists attribute much of the slowdown (in) the growth in healthcare spending to the recession." Even the government study Obama used to make his claim gives credit to the economic downturn -- not the new health care law. It says the recession between 2007 and 2009 had a delayed effect on health care spending. When the economy goes south, high unemployment, losses in private health insurance coverage, drops in household income and companies’ reluctance to hire new employees result in less health care spending, according to the report. The study noted that much of the Affordable Care Act isn’t in place yet, so its effect on recent health care spending has been minimal. For instance, the report estimated the law’s net impact on 2010 spending to be less than 1 percentage point. "Most of the 2010 provisions, other than a few specific provisions affecting Medicare payments, had a negligible impact on total spending or shifted the distribution of spending without affecting the overall rate of growth," the report said. Our ruling Obama said health care premiums have gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years and suggested it was because of the Affordable Care Act. He mistakenly referred to premiums, not all health care spending for 50 years. The historical data for premiums is generally consistent with his claim, but they only go back 14 years. He also vastly exaggerated the impact of his health care law on the costs. Experts say that's due to the recession, not the law. We rate his claim False.

pomt-07002	"We’re losing almost 6,000 state jobs."	true	/texas/statements/2011/jul/09/eddie-rodriguez/austin-rep-eddie-rodriguez-says-budget-cuts-almost/	Critiquing the new state budget, state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez told the Central Texas Democratic Forum that Austin will suffer because of cuts imposed by the Republican-controlled Legislature. "We’re losing almost 6,000 state jobs," the Austin Democrat said June 22. "If you lose a lot of state employees, it affects Austin" — the state capital — "more than almost any other place in Texas." We wondered whether Rodriguez was right about the number of state jobs getting cut in the 2012-13 budget. Nate Walker, Rodriguez's chief of staff, pointed us to an analysis of the adopted budget by the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budgetary matters. The report has a section on "full-time-equivalent positions," which include state agency jobs as well as higher-education jobs that are funded with money appropriated by the Legislature. According to the report, the new state budget provides for 235,240 FTEs in fiscal year 2012 and 235,135 FTEs in 2013. Compared with the 240,862 FTEs that were budgeted for the current fiscal year, which ends Aug. 31, that's a reduction of 5,727 FTEs by 2013, or 2.4 percent. But does that mean 5,727 fewer state jobs by 2013? Sort of. According to the state auditor's office, which collects information on the state's work force, one full-time-equivalent position is "any combination of employees whose hours total 40." That means that an FTE total is not necessarily equivalent to a head count — one FTE position could be filled by two people working 20 hours a week, for example — and that the number of jobs being cut over the next two years could actually be greater than 5,727. It's also important to note that eliminating a position doesn't always mean someone gets laid off. Employers frequently trim their work forces by getting rid of unfilled jobs. And after the 2004-05 budget was written, the last time the state faced a significant revenue shortfall, most of the 10,000 eliminated state jobs were cleared through attrition and a retirement incentive, not layoffs, according to a September 2010 Austin American-Statesman article. According to the most recent information from the state auditor’s office, there were about 255,000 full- and part-time state agency and state-paid higher education employees in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. So, how many of those people are expected to lose their state government jobs because of the budget cuts? That's difficult to determine because we don't know how many of the positions destined to be eliminated are currently filled. Also, the state doesn't have a centralized, single source to go to for layoff plans; those decisions are made at the agency level. Still, news about layoffs at state agencies has been trickling out. The Statesman recently reported that the Texas Education Agency and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department are each expected to lay off more than 100 people. And in an interview with the Statesman published July 2, University of Texas President William Powers Jr. said that roughly 600 UT employees would be laid off "over a couple-year period." In Dallas, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center announced June 29 that it had cut 105 employees, according to a Fort Worth Star-Telegram article. Summing up: Rodriguez’s statement refers to full-time-equivalent positions as jobs. While that's not a perfect fit, it's understandable shorthand for what the new budget requires. We rate this statement as True.	None	Eddie Rodriguez	None	None	None	2011-07-09T06:00:00	2011-06-22	['None']
pomt-10367	"He won't even support his colleague's ... motion to censure the Bush administration for systemic repeated illegal wiretaps."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/30/ralph-nader/obama-hasnt-backed-censure-for-bush/	Longtime consumer advocate and independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader, seeking to attract voters to the left of Sen. Barack Obama, tweaked the Democratic candidate for his unwillingness to censure President Bush. "He won't even support his colleague Sen. Russ Feingold's motion to censure the Bush administration for systemic repeated illegal wiretaps," Nader said in a June 18 interview on the radio program Democracy Now! "He — you know, he's letting the corporate-dominated city of Washington, the corporations who actually rule us now in Washington, determine his agenda. And that does not augur well." Feingold of Wisconsin, known as one of the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, proposed a resolution to censure Bush in March 2006, three months after the New York Times reported that the president had secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans without warrants. Censure, a congressional action that is not defined in the Constitution, has evolved as a formal expression of strong condemnation that is short of impeachment. The Senate has censured only one U.S. president — Andrew Jackson, in 1834, for firing the secretary of the treasury in a dispute over deposits in a national bank. Jackson's party, the Democrats, later expunged the censure. Feingold's proposal was to "condemn [Bush's] unlawful authorization of wiretaps of Americans within the United States without obtaining the court orders required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978." Republicans immediately attacked the measure, and many Democrats distanced themselves from it, including the senator and future presidential candidate from Illinois. "It's not impeachment, but it's not something you apply lightly," Obama told the Chicago Tribune at the time. "And whether we want to start applying censure motions or impeachment when there are questions about a president's authority in national security is something that you have to be judicious about." Only three senators — Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and John Kerry, D-Mass. — have co-sponsored Feingold's resolution. It has not moved out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Obama campaign did not respond to requests to clarify his position on this censure proposal. His past comments and his decision not to co-sponsor Feingold's resolution lead us to conclude Nader was correct in saying Obama does not support it. We find Nader's claim to be True.

pomt-05697	Giant companies like Toyota will not locate in a state that has not passed a right-to-work law	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/11/stephen-laffey/former-cranston-mayor-stephen-laffey-says-giant-co/	Stephen Laffey, the former Cranston mayor and unsuccessful Republican U.S. Senate candidate, was in Rhode Island recently to promote his new film, "Fixing America." The movie is a documentary about Laffey’s travels through 18 states, where he asked a question that is the film’s premise: "What if regular Americans were asked for their ideas on how to fix America's problems?" Laffey, who now lives on a ranch in Fort Collins, Colo., made several appearances on local radio programs to tout the film. On WPRO’s "Morning News" show, he talked about one possible fix: passing right-to-work laws, which allow workers in union jobs to opt out of union membership and paying dues. Giant companies like Toyota, he said, would not locate in states without right-to-work laws. Some Rhode Island Republicans have been pushing for a right-to-work law in Rhode Island, arguing that it would help make the state more business friendly and attract new jobs. In January, we checked a claim from Republican state Sen. Nicholas Kettle, who said right-to-work states don't have budget deficits, ruling it Mostly False. Certainly, Toyota has a giant impact on the U.S. economy. The Japanese auto manufacturer has been doing business in the United States since 1957 and assembling cars here for 25 years. With 10 U.S. manufacturing facilities, Toyota directly employs 29,089 people and has a direct investment of $17.9 billion in the country, according to the company’s 2011 U.S. operations brochure. So we wondered: Was Laffey was on target on his very specific assertion that the company would not locate in states without right-to-work laws? We quickly got our answer when we checked Toyota’s website and saw that it did, indeed, have plants in states without right-to-work laws. Then, we called Toyota and asked spokesman Ed Lewis if Toyota refuses to locate in states that lack right-to-work laws. "No," he said. Lewis confirmed that Toyota has two manufacturing plants in Missouri, plus one each in West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and California. How many of those plants are in right-to-work states? According to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, there are 23 right-to-work states. Five of the Toyota plants are in one of those states (Tennessee, Indiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Texas) while the five others are in non-right-to-work states (two in Missouri and one each in West Virginia, Kentucky and California). Lewis said the most significant factors in locating a plant include easy access to highways and railways, access to supplier networks and tax incentive packages. The location of the existing Toyota plants shows that right-to-work laws is not among the most significant factors in locating a plant, he said. Kentucky, the state with Toyota’s largest direct employment and investment, is not a right-to-work state. California, the state with Toyota’s second-largest direct employment figures, is also not a right-to-work state. The state with Toyota's second largest direct investment, Indiana, became a right-to-work state on Feb. 1 -- more than 15 years after Toyota located there. It is the first state in more than a decade to enact right-to-work legislation and the only one in the Midwestern manufacturing belt to have such a law. When we asked him what he based his statement on, Laffey responded in an e-mail, "The right to work vs. not right to work issue sure is a major consideration of any manufacturing company that is looking to locate a plant in the United States. Let’s take a look!" Laffey included numerous links to stories touting the advantages of right-to-work states to manufacturers. And he attached a spreadsheet he’d created, using U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data, that shows a state-by-state comparison of the growth in real gross domestic product for manufacturing between 2000 and 2010. Laffey’s table showed an 18.63-percent increase in right-to-work states compared with an 8.28-percent increase in other states. "It would seem to be better, all else [being equal], and it never is, to be a right to work state instead of not -- if you would like jobs for the people," he wrote. But that’s a broader public policy question. Turning to the more narrow question about his statement on WPRO, Laffey said, "If I overstated the case in my hours on the radio, I apologize. If it helps educate the people of Rhode Island about the necessity of taking action to improve the business climate, that would be a good step forward." Our ruling Laffey said big companies such as Toyota don’t locate in states without right-to-work laws. A quick web search showed that four of the nine states where Toyota has manufacturing plants do not have right-to-work laws. And a spokesman for Toyota said such laws are not a significant factor in the company’s deciding where to build plants. We rule his statement False. Correction: The initial version of this item reported that we checked a claim from Republican state Sen. Nicholas Kettle on right-to-work states and ruled it False. The actual ruling on Kettle's claim was Mostly False.	None	Stephen Laffey	None	None	None	2012-03-11T00:01:00	2012-03-02	['None']
pomt-14188	"We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/24/bob-graham/bob-graham-saudi-arabia-created-al-qaida/	Controversy is swirling over 28 pages from the congressional report on the 9/11 terror attacks that have been kept hidden from the public. There is a suspicion that they implicate Saudi Arabia, a United States ally in the Middle East. The Saudis have, for years, vigorously denied any involvement in the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. Former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., co-chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee that helped write the report and has pushed for release of all the documents looking at Saudi involvement in the attacks. Sunday on Meet the Press, moderator Chuck Todd asked why United States and Saudi officials don't want the information released. "To me, the most important unanswered question of 9/11 is, did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported?" Graham said. "I think it's implausible to think that people who couldn't speak English, had never been in the United States before, (and) as a group were not well-educated could have done that. So who was the most likely entity to have provided them that support? And I think all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia. We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida. It was a creation of Saudi Arabia." We wondered if, in fact, it was Saudi Arabia that created al-Qaida, the organization led by Osama bin Laden that engineered the attacks. Origin stories The terrorist group's origins can be traced to Afghanistan, where the Soviet Union waged a long and ultimately fruitless war from 1979 to 1989. It was the era of the Cold War, and the United States backed the Muslim insurgents who were fighting the Soviets. The Afghan freedom fighters were also getting backing from fellow Muslims in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries. One person giving money was bin Laden, the son of a wealthy construction magnate. But he also helped establish what was known as the "Golden Chain," a group of Arab donors who gave millions for the cause. The money went to something known as the Services Office, which was run by bin Laden and a Palestinian religious scholar name Abdullah Azzam. The office recruited, trained and equipped thousands of foreign "holy warriors," known as mujahideen, from more than 50 countries. Their training camp was known as "the base," which translates to al-Qaida. In 1988, when the war against the Soviets was winding down, there was a meeting in Pakistan where al-Qaida was formed. Bin Laden wanted to take the fight of jihad to other countries, driving out the corrupting influence of Western countries and replace it with fundamentalist Islam. Bin Laden moved to Saudi Arabia. In 1990, after Iraq President Saddam Hussein invaded neighboring Kuwait, Saudi Arabia's rulers felt vulnerable and asked the United States to intervene. That upset bin Laden. "Bin Laden viewed this development as an unbearable humiliation for all Muslims — the land of the Prophet defiled by infidels," said Philippe Migaux, writing in The History of Terrorism. He offered his mujahideen fighters to help defend the country, but the offer was rejected. He then issued a fatwa, or religious edict, that denounced the ruling House of Saud, calling it corrupt. The Saudi government expelled him in 1991, ultimately stripping him of Saudi citizenship in 1994. He ended up in Sudan, where he operated al-Qaida and coordinated terrorist attacks. Sudan expelled him on May 18, 1996 — but not before he took millions with him raised from his Golden Chain — and he went to Afghanistan, which had just been taken over by the Taliban, a fundamentalist Muslim group. He was in Afghanistan when the 9/11 attacks were launched. A question of financing So did Saudi Arabia start al-Qaida? Clearly Saudi money was directly invested to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan. But once that goal was accomplished and al-Qaida became an entity, the funding became less direct. Daniel Byman, research director at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, said in a email, "Osama bin Laden's personal wealth mattered tremendously when the group was formed in 1988. In a way this wealth was ‘Saudi’ in that his family was a Saudi family, but it's different than the Saudi state or Saudi organizations." "Over time," Byman said, "Bin Laden lost his money and/or the Saudi government froze it. A network of wealthy donors, many from the Gulf states (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia) became vital to al-Qaida funding (and easily eclipsed Bin Laden's personal wealth)." Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said, "It's not as though everyone in the government supported funding al-Qaida." But there was so much Saudi-based support from individual Saudis and organizations that directed money from the Saudi government that the statement should be considered true, Gartenstein-Ross said, even if Graham's statement "is a bit under-nuanced." "He's talking about Saudi financiers. He's not claiming the state itself is a major supporter for al-Qaeda," he said. "Government-sponsored charities were doing it, and the government had to be aware it was going on." "It's clear you had government money that went through these charities," he said. "And while you could talk about lack of oversight for these charities, which used to be the line the government used, mere lack of oversight doesn't fully explain the government's position." It would be more accurate to say that the terrorist organization was created, Gartenstein-Ross said, by "Saudi financiers including organizations financed by the government that don't represent official government policy." Graham directed us to a 2003 Wall Street Journal article that reported "some of Saudi Arabia's richest and most influential families as among the first financial supporters of Osama bin Laden." However, as the article notes, that support came as bin Laden was transitioning away from fighting the Soviets. The families involved have denied funding the al-Qaida-involved terrorist attacks. Graham harked back to his comment on Meet the Press when Todd asked about the distinction between the government and wealthy individuals who happen to be Saudi Arabian. "That is a very murky line. Saudi Arabia has made it murky by its own legal action," Graham said. "Whenever a U.S. group sues a Saudi Arabian entity, whether it’s a bank, a foundation, a charity, immediately, the defense of sovereign immunity is raised. The Saudis don't recognize the difference between a royal decision and a societal decision in the same way that other countries might." Our ruling Graham said, "We know that Saudi Arabia started al-Qaida." Al-Qaida was started in an effort, largely backed by Saudi Arabia, to force the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan. The government did not, strictly speaking, create the organization. It was the product of jihadists wanting to continue the fight after the Soviets left, using the funds of Saudi backers to do it. It prospered because of donations from Saudi interests, including groups tied to the government. The Saudis deserve significant responsibility for its existence. But Graham's phrasing could leave people believing the Saudi government itself created the terrorist organization. The truth is fuzzier, and the caveats are important. So we rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c651dc1e-3467-4404-96a7-78286af7f362	None	Bob Graham	None	None	None	2016-04-24T18:04:06	2016-04-24	['Saudi_Arabia']
pomt-10949	Says Joe Manchin said "yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/24/patrick-morrisey/did-joe-manchin-say-yes-repealing-obamacare-oppone/	The U.S. Senate race in West Virginia got a little hotter with the release of an ad by Republican Patrick Morrisey, who’s challenging incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin. The ad’s narration features the words "lied" or "lying" no fewer than four times. In the ad released July 17, the narrator said, "Liberal lying Joe’s got to go. Told Trump yes to tax cuts. He lied. Yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied. Now Manchin says he’s pro-life but seems to only want a pro-abortion Supreme Court justice. Does Manchin back abortion on demand up to the day of birth? Liberal lying Joe’s got to go." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The narration includes a lot of claims, but in this article we’ll fact check one of them — that Manchin was "yes to repealing Obamacare." At best, the ad oversimplifies Manchin’s record on Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. The law, signed by President Barack Obama, overhauled the nation’s health care insurance markets and provided other consumer protections. Manchin has been open about not liking certain parts of the law, and has said that he’d like to repeal those portions. But we were unable to find an example in which he supported a repeal of the entire law. Manchin’s comments from 2010 Here are some of the instances of Manchin’s comments in 2010, when he was the state’s governor running in a tight special election for Senate. His Republican challenger, businessman John Raese, was accusing him of being a rubber stamp for Obama. • On Sept. 18, 2010, the Gazette-Mail reported, "The governor recently told the Gazette-Mail that he backed only certain provisions (of the Affordable Care Act) — for instance, those that allow people with pre-existing conditions to get health care, or let young adults stay on their parents' health plans. ‘I wouldn't have voted for the final version of that thing with the way that it came out,’" he said. • On Sept. 27, 2010, Real Clear Politics wrote that Manchin, previously a strong supporter of the law, now "favored ‘repealing the things that are bad in that bill.’ He ticked off a list of reforms in the law that he supports and asserted there is broad agreement in both parties for many of them. ‘Can't you keep that as a good base?’ he said, adding, ‘It's a great bill.’ He emphasized that he's not calling for wholesale repeal and just wants to roll back parts of it… ." • On Oct. 8, 2010, MSNBC’s Hardball host Chris Matthews asked Manchin, "Do you like the health care bill that Obama got through? Do you like it?" Manchin responded, "No, not the way it passed." • On Oct. 11, 2010, Manchin said on Fox And Friends that he’s "always been in favor of health reform" but the law was "far too reaching … . It needs to have a lot of it repealed." • On Oct. 24, 2010, Manchin was pressed on his stance by host Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Wallace asked, "You're saying now that if you'd known what was really in the bill, although last March you said you'd have voted for it, you now say you would have voted against it?" Manchin responded, "Correct. Now, knowing the existence as far as how reaching it had been, as far as an onerous, I would have." He added, however, "There's a lot of good parts to it. Why won't we fix what's wrong with it and make it better?" • Perhaps most notably, on Oct. 12, 2010, the Charleston Daily Mail quoted remarks by Manchin that had been reported previously in the Wheeling Intelligencer: "They can absolutely be sure I will vote to repeal the whole thing unless we can find common ground and common sense." That's the closest example we could find of an affirmative vote to repeal, but we couldn't find it corroborated. The Daily Mail article added, "The Daily Mail has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to talk directly to Manchin about his position on health care over the past couple of weeks." It’s clear that Manchin, facing a tough election, was walking a tightrope on the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Presented with the hypothetical question of whether he would have voted for the bill if he’d been in Congress at the time, Manchin said — some of the time — that he would not have. But that’s not the same as saying "yes to repealing Obamacare," as the ad asserts. In fact, his message in these comments was that he had some problems with the law, but he wanted to repeal the problematic portions, not the whole bill. Manchin’s 2014 comment Morrisey’s campaign also pointed us to an article in the Register-Herald of Beckley, W.Va., on Feb 20, 2014. It’s about a local town hall appearance by Manchin. Here’s the relevant portion: Both parties agree on many aspects of the ACA, such as pre-existing conditions not being excluded from coverage and no lifetime caps, but there are still many kinks that need to be fixed, Manchin said. "I will vote tomorrow to repeal (the ACA), but I want to fix the problems in it." He said the ACA is essentially a product and the government needs to find a way to "sell it" and make their customers want to buy it. The phrasing of the quote is odd, because there was no Obamacare repeal vote held the next day or the succeeding few days, according to Senate records. Indeed, Manchin’s camp quickly sought to clarify the comments at the time. After the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, reported the contents of the Register-Herald’s article, Manchin’s office provided a rebuttal that was added to the article: In an email to The Hill, Manchin said that despite his comments, he does not support repealing the law. "I have never supported repealing the Affordable Care Act because I came to Washington to find solutions to our country’s problems," he said. ... Still, Manchin said the law has "many flaws," and that those parts that can’t be fixed and should be eliminated. "We should be working together to identify which parts of the law are broken and need to be fixed," he continued. "We may learn that some parts of the law can’t be repaired, and we should eliminate those parts entirely. …" It’s incomplete to cite Manchin’s words as reported in the local newspaper, since Manchin immediately sought to clarify what was reported. Manchin’s votes on repeal bills Since his election to the Senate, Manchin has voted consistently against repealing the Affordable Care Act wholesale. In eight Senate repeal votes tracked by healthreformvotes.org, a website affiliated with the liberal-leaning group healthinsurance.org, Manchin spurned GOP-led repeal efforts and voted for the "pro-consumer" side on all eight occasions. Those eight votes included one in 2011, two in 2015, and five in 2017. Manchin’s more recent comments on the Affordable Care Act Recently, Manchin’s message on the Affordable Care Act has been consistent: He strongly approves of many things in the bill, and wants to fix the bill’s shortcomings rather than repealing it wholesale. Here’s a sampling of comments since early 2017, when President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans sought to repeal the law: • In March 2017, he told reporters on Capitol Hill that in West Virginia, "I got an older population, I got a poorer population, and I got an opiate issue we need to clean up. And now, talk about insult to injury. You’ve got to have a moral compass inside of you." • Manchin said in May 2017 that "if they can get rid of the word 'repeal,' Democrats can sit down," according to the Washington Examiner. • In July 2017, Manchin told WTOV-TV in Steubenville, Ohio, "I'm not voting to repeal any of the votes (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.) wants on repealing (Obamacare). I don't think you can throw the baby out with the bathwater thinking that you're going to save the baby when the baby might've needed a diaper change." • He also told the Intelligencer and the News-Register in Wheeling, W.Va., "I don’t think we should be repealing," Manchin said, adding, "Come on guys, let’s sit down and fix it." Our ruling Morrisey’s ad said that Manchin said "yes to repealing Obamacare. He lied." During his tough initial Senate race in 2010, Manchin did rhetorically put some distance between himself and the law, which was passed before he was a senator. However, to the extent that he supported repeals, he was talking about repealing portions of the law he saw as problematic — not the whole law, much of which he said he supported. Indeed, Manchin has consistently voted against and criticized wholesale repeal efforts, saying that he favored reforming portions of the law instead. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02061	41,200 veterans in Florida "don’t have health care because Scott didn’t expand Medicaid."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/may/28/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-veterans-lack-health-care-due-r/	As Memorial Day approached, both Gov. Rick Scott and his anticipated Democratic rival Charlie Crist called on Veterans Administration Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign amid news reports that VA staff falsified documentation about how long veterans were waiting to receive health care. But then Crist pointed the finger at Scott in a series of tweets on May 22 and 23: • "In addition -- if I were governor, I would take immediate action to make sure our veterans here in FL are getting the care they need." • "I’d call a special session to expand health care to the more than 41,000 FL vets who are left w/o coverage due to Scott’s failure." • "41.2k vets in FL don’t have health care because Scott didn't expand Medicaid. Unconscionable." It was that last tweet that caught our eye. We decided to fact-check the number Crist cited and whether they lack health care because Scott failed to expand Medicaid. Florida rejects Medicaid expansion Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government to care for low-income people. The Affordable Care Act aimed to expand the program. Specifically, the law would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 was $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. Scott, who campaigned on his opposition to Obamacare, initially opposed Medicaid expansion. But in February 2013 he changed his position and came out in support of it. Scott didn’t push the Republican-led Legislature to approve it, and ultimately legislators rejected it. The result is that now more than 800,000 uninsured Floridians earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to qualify for subsidies to help buy insurance in the federal marketplace. Urban Institute study About 40 percent of veterans nationwide are on VA care. Generally, veterans have to serve for two consecutive years and not be discharged dishonorably to be eligible for VA health care, which gives priority to those with service-related injuries or who are low income. Also, some veterans choose not to enroll in VA care, for example, if they don’t live near any VA facilities. Some veterans who either aren’t eligible or choose not to enroll in VA could be eligible for Medicaid. In tweeting his attack, Crist linked to a March 2013 nationwide study by the Washington-based Urban Institute. The study analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data to estimate how many military veterans aged 19 to 64 don’t have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) The study found that 535,000 uninsured veterans nationwide would qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. However, the majority would only qualify for Medicaid if their state chose to expand it. The institute’s report said in Florida there were 103,700 non-elderly veterans who lacked health insurance, which included 41,200 who would qualify for Medicaid if the state expanded the program. We ran the study by Jack Tsai, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale who co-wrote a separate study about the number of uninsured veterans and Medicaid expansion, but didn’t include a state-by-state breakdown. Tsai said that the methodology of the Urban Institute study is "fairly solid." However, he noted it is based on data from a few years ago, and that Crist’s statement didn’t include details about the study’s limitations. There are various reasons why some veterans remain uninsured: Some might feel they don’t need insurance or haven’t gotten around to obtaining it or may not be aware of their VA eligibility or don’t want anything to go to the VA. Likewise, there might be similar reasons to not enroll with Medicaid, while others could be in between jobs. We asked spokespersons for the governor’s office and his campaign if they had any evidence to refute Crist’s claim. Campaign spokesman Greg Blair reiterated that Scott supported Medicaid but the Legislature didn’t go along with it. He also pointed to 2011 Medicaid reform intended to lower the cost of health care. Our ruling Crist said in a tweet that 41,200 veterans in Florida "don’t have health care because Scott didn’t expand Medicaid." Crist’s tweet linked to a map that cited the Urban Institute study showing the number of uninsured veterans in each state that might qualify for the Medicaid expansion. Crist’s tweet omits two major points: Some of those 41,200 veterans could get health care other ways. It’s possible some are eligible for services through the VA but for a variety of reasons haven’t sought those benefits. Also, Scott’s not solely responsible for Florida failing to expand Medicaid. After Scott opposed the expansion, he came out in support of it in February 2013. But Scott didn’t lobby for it, and the Legislature rejected it last year. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14164	"Pat Toomey advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/29/katie-mcginty/did-sen-pat-toomey-say-he-wanted-eliminate-all-cor/	Katie McGinty has been the Democratic nominee for Pennsylvania Senate for all of three days, but the general election campaign between her and incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey has already begun. In a press release circulated Thursday, McGinty’s campaign -- running on the "working families" platform -- wrote that "Pat Toomey advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes." It cited a 2007 CNBC interview in which Toomey, a Republican, said he was in favor of eliminating the tax burden on corporations. Eliminating all taxes didn’t sound like Toomey’s campaign platform. In fact, on his campaign website, Toomey has an entire section of his "issues" page dedicated to "eliminating corporate welfare." So we decided to check the claim. In 2007, Toomey was a congressman from Allentown and the president of the Club For Growth, a conservative group that advocates for the reduction or elimination of corporate taxes. Toomey appeared on CNBC to discuss tax reform and cutting the corporate tax rate (the top marginal tax rate is 35 percent) which, he says in the interview, would stimulate the economy. "I would disagree with the idea that we want to have a corporate tax burden at all," he says in the interview, going on to say: "All it really does is it creates this insidious opportunity for politicians to play games, to create winners and losers, to have manipulative deductions and loopholes and write-offs. We shouldn’t have any of that. Let’s have a transparent system. Let’s not tax corporations. Let’s allow them to compete most aggressively on the global economy." When the interviewer skeptically asks Toomey if that type of reform would be possible in today’s political environment, he seems to acknowledge it’s a stretch, saying, "a rational discussion can only lead to the conclusion that we should have a simpler tax code and rates, at a minimum, much lower. I’d prefer none on corporations. But much lower would be better." Toomey's campaign pointed out the senator's formally proposed tax plans have included lowering the corporate tax rate -- the highest in the developed world -- in a "revenue neutral manner by eliminating tax loopholes." His budget proposals for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. The CNBC interview is one of the only examples of a time when Toomey advocated specifically for the full elimination of corporate income taxes; in front of Congress and in otherwise public appearances, he typically calls for a simple reduction in the tax. "This old clip was simply a discussion about how higher taxes hurts job creation," Toomey's spokesman Ted Kwong said. His CNBC comments in 2007 don’t exactly jibe with what he wrote in his 2009 book "The Road to Prosperity: How to Grow Our Economy and Revive the American Dream." In the book, Toomey wrote about two other tax systems he’d favor over our current one: A flat tax, which would require businesses pay a 17 percent tax on income (a decrease from the current 35 percent), and a "fair tax," which would totally eliminate corporate and income taxes in favor of a sales tax. Still, he writes, "my preference lies with the flat tax." Toomey’s campaign website notes the senator "supports closing special-interest loopholes and lowering rates for all Americans," but doesn’t mention lowering or eliminating taxes on corporations. Decreasing or eliminating corporate taxes is a tough sell. A 2014 Gallup poll showed two thirds of Americans think corporations "pay too little" in taxes. Despite that, reducing the corporate tax rate has some bipartisan backing. In 2012, President Obama proposed reducing the rate to 28 percent. Our ruling McGinty’s campaign says Toomey "advocated for eliminating all corporate taxes." While he told CNBC back in 2007 "Let’s not tax corporations" and his book mentions it as one of his two favored tax plans, the incumbent Senator seems to know that corporate taxes aren’t going away completely anytime soon. While it's true he’s most recently advocated for a lower tax rate and a simplified system, he did tell CNBC viewers he’d prefer no tax at all. We rate the claim True.

pomt-06716	"In (Sen. Marco) Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/sep/01/ed-schultz/ed-schultz-says-social-security-lifts-million-flor/	Sen. Marco Rubio, in a recent speech from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, said Social Security and Medicare "weakened us as a people." We used to take care of one another, and our neighbors, until government took over, he explained. Liberal MSNBC pundit Ed Schultz called that "Psychotalk." It's a segment on the Ed Show he uses to scorn comments by politicians and other pundits, most recently Donald Trump, Jon Huntsman, Mitt Romney and George Will. On Aug. 25, he challenged the star Florida conservative, calling him a political hack who wants to get rid of social safety nets. (Rubio, for his part, said in the speech he believes in America's retirement programs, but that they must be changed for those who aren't in them yet to make them sustainable.) A Florida statistic during the segment caught our attention: "In Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty." PolitiFact Florida wanted to know, is that true? (We also checked a statement by Rubio from the same speech about the ratio of workers to retirees in the Social Security program dipping from 16 to 1 down to 3 to 1.) On its face, the number seems plausible. Social Security benefits, set up as a result of a 1935 law signed by President Franklin Roosevelt, helped support 52 million retired and disabled workers and their relatives in 2009, according to the agency that administers them. But who provided Schultz's number? We took a closer look at a Nexis transcript, which we edited slightly after watching the segment ourselves: SCHULTZ: And in Psychotalk tonight, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, he's on the attack against the Big Three. Now Rubio is an early favorite to take the No. 2 spot on the Republican presidential ticket next year thanks to his tea party ideology and his pretty boy looks. But his policies are downright ugly. During a speech at the Reagan Library this week, Rubio had this to say about programs like Social Security and Medicare. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA: These programs actually weakened us as a people. You see, almost in forever, it was institutions and society that assumed the role of taking care of one another. If someone was sick in your family, you took care of them. If a neighbor met misfortune, you took care of them. You saved for your retirement and for your future because you had to. … But all of that changed when the government began to assume those responsibilities. ... And as government crowded out the institutions in our society that did these things traditionally, it weakened our people. (END VIDEO CLIP) SCHULTZ: I will tell you what's weakening our people: political hacks like Marco Rubio, who want to get rid of social safety nets. Before Medicare -- check this out -- half of American seniors didn't have hospital insurance. Almost a third of Americans lived in poverty. But after Medicare was signed into law, the poverty rate among senior citizens plummeted from 30 percent to around 10 percent in just 30 years. And it's the same story with Social Security. According to the Census Bureau data, 20 million more Americans would live below the poverty line if Social Security did not exist. Forty five percent of senior citizens would be poor. And in Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty. But these right wingers remain determined to dismantle the Big Three, no matter how many Americans suffer. For Marco Rubio to say programs like Medicare and Social Security weaken Americans is flat out Psychotalk. For this fact-check, we're setting aside the national statistics Schultz offered about Medicare and Social Security and focusing on his Florida claim. Where did the Florida statistic come from? Schultz had said in a previous paragraph, "according to Census Bureau data," and a spokeswoman for his show, Tanya Hayre, confirmed "we source the Census Bureau in our reporting." But a graphic on the screen as Schultz spoke gave a different source: the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. We found the report. It shows Schultz accurately repeated numbers from the think tank's 2010 analysis of Census data. The authors of the analysis, Paul Van de Water and Arloc Sherman, took the official definition of poverty used by the Census Bureau, then crunched Census-provided numbers on families' poverty status with and without Social Security benefits. Without Social Security, they found, 19.8 million more Americans would have been poor in 2008, including 1.07 million in Florida. (The state numbers relied on a three-year average for 2006-08, to boost the reliability of the results.) So far, so good, for Schultz. But whenever someone cites government data but, in fact, is relying on analysis of that data by a think tank, we check to see whether other experts interpret the same data differently. For example, in July Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., cited the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in a claim about the effect of tax cuts on the national debt -- when her conclusion came from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In that case it turned out that conservative think tanks used the same CBO numbers to support a different conclusion. We ultimately rated her statement Half True. In this case, Van de Water and Sherman named in their report a conservative critic of their analysis, Charles Blahous, one of two public trustees of Social Security and Medicare and a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. We traded e-mails with him. We also called up Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. A note: These people all know each other. Biggs and Van de Water worked together at the Social Security Administration while Blahous was a special assistant to the president for economic policy focusing on "retirement security issues." Now they all work at think tanks, helping shape how we view public policy. And as Van de Water put it, "We worked together, but we disagree on a number of things." Indeed. Here's what Biggs and Blahous say about Van de Water's analysis: It's meaningless and misleading. "The SSA used to publish these figures but stopped because they were deceptive, so now the lefty think tanks calculate the figures themselves," Biggs said. "That says something!" Van de Water confirmed the Social Security Administration used to do the same analysis while he was there but stopped early into President George W. Bush's administration -- because of views like Blahous'. So the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities started computing the the poverty figures, using the same methodology, he said. What do Blahous and Biggs find misleading? The analysis focuses on benefits only, not the years and years of payroll taxes that families fed into the system. What if those tax dollars had stayed in workers' pockets? Would they still face poverty? "To make any reasonable statements about the program's net effect on poverty, one needs to come up with a model for how high poverty would be without each of Social Security benefits or taxes," Blahous said. He says to get a truer sense of the program's current effect, you would have to consult studies like these from the Social Security actuary. In the early years of Social Security, its effect on poverty was much greater -- workers got out in benefits much more than they paid in taxes. It offered a windfall to early beneficiaries at the expense of later ones. But look at Tables 2 or 3 in the actuary's July 2010 publication, he said, and you see that would shift if the program raises taxes or cuts benefits, as it would need to to fully finance benefits more than 25 years from now. For example, low-wage single males born in 1937 or later -- retiring this century -- would actually get out less than they put in. (Very low-wage males, plus females and couples would fare better longer.) As an aside, that crunch will continue as fewer and fewer workers support more retirees. Meanwhile, the Social Security Administration had to dip into its trust fund several years earlier than anticipated, in part because of the economy. Still, as PolitiFact has ruled twice, it's wrong to say the program's out of money. That makes it all the more misleading, Blahous and Biggs say, to claim that Social Security lifts more than a million people out of poverty in Florida based on analysis of benefits only. They might not have been in poverty if not for the taxes they paid, and for some it would have been a better deal to invest directly in Treasury bonds rather than in the Social Security system. "I'm sure it does reduce poverty, but not by anything like they're talking about," Biggs said. "... They're looking at one side of an equation in a very simplistic way." Is that the whole story? Not quite. Let's say low-income workers -- presumably at higher risk for poverty in retirement -- didn't have to pay Social Security taxes. Would they carefully put aside that amount? It's more likely they would spend it, Van de Water said. Not only that, Social Security is designed to pay out more to low-income workers than they put in. In other words, letting them keep their payroll taxes wouldn't support them as well as providing them Social Security checks. "It's clear that Social Security keeps lots of low-income elderly out of poverty in retirement," Van de Water said. He acknowledges his analysis answers a very narrow question: How many people would fall into poverty if Social Security checks stopped today? It's not as good for answering the broader question: What if Social Security had never existed at all? And of course, that's not an easy question to answer, said another expert, Olivia Mitchell of the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania. "If we had no Social Security, people would have to work longer, save more, become more financially literate, buy annuities and private disability insurance, contribute to their own IRAs and pensions, and probably rely more on family and charity if they were hoping to retire," she said. "We can't easily run the counterfactual experiment!" Yet it's the broader question that Schultz suggests on his MSNBC show in his setup for the Florida statistic. He says, "20 million more Americans would live below the poverty line if Social Security did not exist." If it had disappeared into thin air one day in 2008, sure. If it had never come into being? Much tougher to say. So when he says, "In Rubio's state of Florida alone, Social Security lifts more than -- count it -- a million people out of poverty," he's accurately quoting a study by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities about what would happen if Social Security checks suddenly stopped. But the statistic doesn't directly address Rubio's apparent point, that America would be stronger if FDR had never signed Social Security into existence. That's a matter for thoughtful speculation or a raft of much more complicated studies. We also found it misleading that Schultz mentioned just the Census Bureau as his source, while graphics on the screen in small type confirmed the numbers were in fact crunched by a think tank. For those reasons, we find he used the statistic out of context, and rate it Half True.	None	Ed Schultz	None	None	None	2011-09-01T11:46:41	2011-08-25	['None']
pomt-14400	The rate of U.S. female homicide victims outnumbers 24 other developed countries by more than 2½ to 1.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/14/everytown-gun-safety/anti-gun-group-uses-old-data-incorrectly-compare-i/	We see a lot of statistics about the murder rate in the United States, particularly as part of the debate over gun control. But a Facebook meme making the rounds is contending that the homicide rate for American women is more than two and a half times higher that it is for other developed countries. A reader in Utah pointed us to the meme on the page of a group called Everytown for Gun Safety, whose web page lists former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as a member of the advisory board. The reader wondered if it was accurate. We did, too. Posted March 8, the meme reports the rates of female homicide for 25 countries. The United States' is 1.54 per 100,000 women. That's just over 2½ times the rate for the second-ranked country, Switzerland, whose rate is listed as 0.61 per 100,000. The chart does not list a source. First, a few things to note about the meme. Although Everytown is an anti-gun violence group, the meme mentions nothing about weapons. The legend at the bottom simply says the chart is listing murder rates. Also, because the headline on the meme talks about "America's Deadly Domestic Violence Problem," it's not clear if the group is talking about all causes of homicide or just domestic violence homicide. The answer turns out to be neither. Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for the group, said the data come from a 2002 paper in the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association that used World Health Organization statistics on female murder rates — both gun related and non-gun related — from 1994 to 1999. The data in the Everytown meme are the rates for gun homicides, not all homicides. The rates were from 25 populous high-income countries. But when you look at all homicides — which the chart claims to be measuring — the rates are different. The United States was still No. 1, with 3.21 murders per 100,000 women during the 1990s. But the United States was not as far ahead of the rest of the pack. The rate was 1.7 times higher than No. 2 Finland and about 2.4 times higher than the countries in third, fourth and fifth place, which were Switzerland, Belgium and New Zealand respectively. "The U.S. female homicide victimization rate was 5 times higher than the rate for the other high-income countries combined," said the researchers, led by David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. More recent data When we contacted Hemenway seeking newer data, he sent us a November 2015 paper done with Erin Grinshteyn of the University of Nevada-Reno, which found that the U.S. homicide rate was 7 times higher than 23 other high-income countries — 25 times higher if you only look at gun deaths. But the paper offers no breakdown by gender. It used 2010 mortality data from the World Health Organization. We contacted Grinshteyn directly, and she sent us the 2010 rates for women in more detail. We've put it in chart form. Newer homicide estimates are available in a WHO report released in 2014. They show a similar pattern. In that ranking, female murder rates in the United States in 2012 were much higher than 22 other countries. Finland and Belgium ranked second and third, at 1.3 each, but the difference is not as dramatic as the Everytown Facebook chart. The report did not compile rates for female gun deaths. Lamb also said the group was in the process of fixing the chart, which had been shared 1,869 times when we last checked. Our ruling Everytown for Gun Safety produced a chart showing that the rate of U.S. female homicides outnumbers the rates in 24 other developed countries by more than 2½ to 1. But the rates in the chart are for gun-related homicides, not all homicides. Nor are they the rates for domestic violence deaths among women, contrary to the headline on the chart. Finally, the data are about two decades out of date. The relationship that caught our eye — female homicides being 2½ times more common than other developed countries — is not as extreme, according to the latest estimates, although the United States is clearly far ahead of other developed countries. The chart gets the general trend right, but most of its actual numbers are off. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-09427	Several times, Obama "has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally ... ."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/15/mitt-romney/obama-remarks-never-true-apology/	Mitt Romney's new book is called No Apology. The first chapter makes it clear who he thinks is apologizing: President Barack Obama. "Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined," Romney writes. "It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them." Obama might give compliments to America here and there, Romney adds. "But what makes his speeches jump out at his audience are the steady stream of criticisms, put-downs, and jabs directed at the nation he was elected to represent and defend. "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Mulism sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." As we did our research, we noticed that the idea that Obama has traveled the world apologizing is popular among some conservative Web sites. The Heritage Foundation, for example, published an analysis in June 2009 called "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies." Similar compilations are available elsewhere, and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has mentioned Obama apologizing several times. But as we looked over Obama's remarks, we noticed that he never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: "sorry." Merriam-Webster defines an apology as "an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret." If someone is apologizing, it seems that is a discrete act that can be verified and fact-checked. We set out to discover how accurate Romney was in describing Obama as constantly apologizing. What Obama said We read the seven Obama speeches and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. Because of their length, we've compiled those passages into a separate document with links to the full remarks, and we encourage you to click over and read those remarks now. To summarize them here, the remarks include major speeches, press conferences, and remarks at a town hall meeting. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he is tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together. At a town hall meeting in France, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. "On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated," Obama concluded. And at a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." At other times, Obama doesn't seem so much to be criticizing the United States as he is criticizing the foreign policy stances of the Bush administration. In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said that the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama was quick to turn the question toward the Bush team. "Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable," Obama said. "I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply "move forward." Here are his exact remarks: "In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward." Looking at all the remarks Romney cited, we noticed that Obama is most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama mentioned this in four separate instances that Romney cited in the fact we're checking. Typically, Obama would say that the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." (He has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; it remains open as of this writing.) Obama's most pointed remarks on Guantanamo were at the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism. Obama said that after 9/11, "our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions." He also said that the Guantanamo prison "likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies." Did Obama apologize? We sent Obama's remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing. • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama is definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advanage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." He noted that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the U.S. has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. "There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation," he said. • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret." Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. "There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will," Murphy said. "The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that. • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." • Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the Web site Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." Other presidential apologies Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, we decided to narrow our focus and look at Obama's two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Several sources we reviewed discussed Clinton's remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and described them as an apology. But Clinton did not explicitly apologize, and he assigned responsibility to the international community, not just the United States. "The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well," Clinton said in Rwanda in 1998. "We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope." Clinton did apologize, forcefully, to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. "The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong," Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. "To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry." Bush made remarks in 2002 about American slavery, which some people construed as an apology, at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not formally apologize or express regret, instead opting to praise the Americans in history who worked to end slavery. "My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy and it is not over," he said. "The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all." Bush did, however, specifically apologize to King Abdullah of Jordan for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The 2004 apology took place privately, but Bush and Abdullah spoke soon after at a Rose Garden press conference. "We also talked about what has been on the TV screens recently, not only in our own country, but overseas -- the images of cruelty and humiliation. I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America," Bush said. "I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America." Obama's praise and motivations While Obama has admitted mistakes, he has also praised America. Romney acknowledges as much when he writes that Obama "always the skillful politician, will throw in compliments about America here and there." In Cairo, Obama called the United States "one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world." At the Langley speech, Obama told the CIA staff, "What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy; even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different. So, yes, you've got a harder job. And so do I. And that's okay, because that's why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies, because we're on the better side of history." And at his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Obama said: "Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity." We reviewed several analyses of what Obama's foreign policy goals are in traveling the world and readily admitting to America's mistakes. One of the most interesting essays we read was written by historian Walter Russell Mead for the journal Foreign Policy. Obama's foreign policy follows in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson and more recently of Jimmy Carter, Mead writes. Obama's goal is to reduce America's costs and risks overseas. In Obama's view, Mead writes, "Large military budgets divert resources from pressing domestic needs; close association with corrupt and tyrannical foreign regimes involves the United States in dirty and cynical alliances; the swelling national-security state threatens civil liberties and leads to powerful pro-war, pro-engagement lobbies among corporations nourished on grossly swollen federal defense budgets. ... "Obama seeks a quiet world in order to focus his efforts on domestic reform -- and to create conditions that would allow him to dismantle some of the national-security state inherited from the Cold War and given new life and vigor after 9/11. Preferring disarmament agreements to military buildups and hoping to substitute regional balance-of-power arrangements for massive unilateral U.S. force commitments all over the globe, the president wishes ultimately for an orderly world in which burdens are shared and the military power of the United States is a less prominent feature on the international scene." Our ruling In reviewing Romney's book, we couldn't help but notice that Romney's diagnosis of the problems America faces are very similar to the themes Obama often repeats: The U.S. needs to educate its children better to remain competitive in the global marketplace. We spend too much money on health care. The fiscal future is ultimately unsustainable. It is in the matter of foreign policy that Romney lays out the most aggressive case against Obama, warning that the United States needs to maintain its military dominance in the world, particularly in the face of threats from China, Russia and Islamic jihadists. Obama, Romney writes, needs to "proudly defend her rather than continually apologize for her." Here, we're checking Romney's statement that Obama "has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision" and a host of other reasons. If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms. We set out to discover whether Obama really had apologized in his speeches, and what he was apologizing for. But in our review of his words, we came up short. Yes, there is criticism in some of his speeches, but it's typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and often he mentions other countries and how they have erred as well. There's not a full-throated, sincere apology in the bunch. And so we rate Romney's statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e94d364b-9df6-4b93-93f7-05cc58722c8e	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2010-03-15T09:58:59	2010-03-02	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-05757	"We've seen in this last year tremendous things happening, including our unemployment rate come down 2 percentage points."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/01/cory-booker/cory-booker-claims-jobless-rate-fell-two-percentag/	Newark Mayor Cory Booker said his city is doing "unprecedented things to move forward" despite wrenching economic circumstances. Asked in a radio interview last week about the State of the City address he’ll deliver today, Booker said Newark’s population is rising, development projects are going up downtown and businesses are moving to town. Amid that growth, the mayor also highlighted a trend moving in the opposite direction: the city’s jobless rate is shrinking, he claimed. "We've seen in this last year tremendous things happening, including our unemployment rate come down 2 percentage points," Booker said on WBGO’s "Newark Today" on Feb. 23. A spokeswoman for the mayor provided data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from January 2011 to December 2011 to support Booker’s claim. During that time frame the unemployment rate in Newark fell from 15.9 percent to 13.9 percent. But that comparison has flaws. The data on unemployment rates in New Jersey’s cities are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations such as holiday and summer hiring. Garrett Schmitt, an economist with U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, said for that reason, the agency recommends comparing annual averages or year-over-year data, meaning one month from one year to the same month the next year, when using nonseasonally adjusted data.. The average annual rate for 2011 is not yet available. From December 2010 to December 2011, the most recent month of federal data available, Newark’s unemployment rate fell from 14.6 percent to 13.9 percent, or 0.7 percentage points. "The Mayor’s statement was 100% true and factually accurate. The unemployment rate in Newark in 2011 fell by 2 percentage points," Adam Zipkin, the city’s deputy mayor for economic and housing development, said in a statement. "This is significant because it is the first time in seven years that Newark has seen the unemployment rate fall within a calendar year by two full percentage points. While experts, economists and others may want to color, shape or contextualize that fact with other statistics over different time periods, it is still a fact. Just as when monthly job and unemployment numbers are reported broadly on national networks, many people will have comments on those facts but the numbers themselves are indisputable." It’s worth noting that using the time frame Booker’s office cited, a similar claim about the jobless rate could have been made in 2010. That year, the unemployment rate fell from 16.1 percent in January to 14.6 percent in December. But the next month, in January 2011, the rate jumped to 15.9 percent. That’s not an isolated incident. Since 2006, the unemployment rate has increased in January from the previous December. Our ruling Booker claimed that in the past year, Newark’s unemployment rate fell two percentage points. A spokeswoman for the Newark mayor cited nonseasonally adjusted federal data from January 2011 to December 2011 to support his claim. Within that time frame, the unemployment rate fell two percentage points. But an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said his agency recommends comparing year-over-year data or annual averages when using statistics that are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations. From December 2010 to December of last year, the city’s unemployment rate dropped 0.7 percentage points, not two percentage points. We rate this claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05114	Says because of Texas lawmakers’ choices, "hundreds of thousands of women no longer have access to basic medical care, life-saving cancer screenings and contraception."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/27/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-texas-lawmakers-cut-basic-health-/	"Those in charge in Austin are failing to invest in our future," state Sen. Wendy Davis told the Texas Democratic Party convention June 9, 2012. Among the examples in the Fort Worth Democrat’s speech: "Hundreds of thousands of women no longer have access to basic medical care, life-saving cancer screenings and contraception." That sounds like a large-scale, life-threatening concern. We asked Davis how she reached her conclusion, and learned that she was referring to 2011 budget cuts to the Texas Department of State Health Services’ family planning program. Spokesman Anthony Spangler emailed us a collection of links to news stories as well as letters, memos and Davis’ written responses. According to the program’s website, the services it provides include a health check and follow-ups on health problems as well as contraception, counseling and tests for cervical cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and diabetes. Department spokeswoman Carrie Williams told us by email that clients must fall under 250 percent of the federal poverty level to receive help through the program. By 2012 guidelines, that would translate to an annual income of $57,625 for a family of four. How many affected? The funding cuts, according to an April 24, 2011, Associated Press news article and a May 24, 2011, news article in the Austin American-Statesman, emerged in April 2011 when some of the Republican-led House's most conservative lawmakers pushed a series of floor amendments, shifting money from family planning services to programs for poor and disabled children, anti-abortion-rights programs and crisis pregnancy centers. Spangler sent us a May 5, 2011, memo from the Legislative Budget Board estimating that 283,909 women would lose basic health care in the 2012-13 biennium if the program got $37.9 million from the state instead of $99.6 million listed in the first version of the budget taken up by lawmakers. The board has not made a more recent estimate, spokesman John Barton told us by phone. State Health Services bases its calculation on slightly different figures. Williams told us that because the family planning program’s 2010-11 budget was $111.5 million, the Legislature’s approval of $37.9 million for 2012-13 was a decrease of $73.6 million. Williams said that dividing that number by $205 -- the average cost per client -- and taking into account that 95 percent of clients are women, the department estimates the program would serve 160,000 to 180,000 fewer women per year. The full effect of the cuts won’t be felt until next year, Williams said, because the department was allowed to carry over $5 million from the 2011 budget to ease the transition. Precise data were not immediately available, but the one-time money helped provide services to "thousands" of women, she said. Going by the $205-per-client cost, it appears the number could be up to 23,000. Spangler also sent us a March 8, 2012 report from the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities that put the per-year number at 150,000. Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the center, said her group used budget board numbers from the 2012-13 state appropriations act and State Health Services’ 2012 operating budget. In sum: Assorted estimates say between 137,000 and 180,000 women are losing State Health Services family planning in 2012. For 2013, estimates range from 150,000 to 180,000. Already lost access? Considering that Davis said the women "no longer have access," we sought to determine how many of those women already have been affected by the cuts. Davis told us that women lost coverage when the 2011 budget changes took effect September 1, 2011. Williams told us 157 of the State Health Services program’s 300 clinics have closed and that whereas in the first half of fiscal 2011 the state program had served 116,410 people, in the first half of fiscal 2012 it had served 34,185. So, from September 2011 to June 2012, some 82,225 fewer people, almost all of them women, got services through the state program than from September 2010 to June 2011, Williams said. She said the department can’t estimate whether more clinics might close. Davis told us that when she spoke, she was not limiting her count to the women already no longer getting services previously funded through the Department of State Health Services. Instead, she said, she was speaking to the projected effect of the adopted budget cuts through the two-year budget period ending Aug. 31, 2013. She said that because the 2011 Legislature’s cut has been enacted and, short of an unlikely special session, won't be reversed, hundreds of thousands of women will be denied care during the two-year period covered by the budget. No other options? It’s one thing for the services singled out by Davis not to be provided by Department of State Health Services-supported clinics. We asked the senator how she knows hundreds of thousands of women no longer have access to such services from any providers. Davis said, "The women accessing health care through family planning services turned to the DSHS services because they have no other options. That option no longer exists." Separately, we tried -- and failed -- to get a sense of how many women have no resource for health care including cancer screenings and contraception other than the State Health Services family planning program, but did not come up with specific counts or estimates. Williams at State Health Services and Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said they have numbers on how many women use their departments’ programs, but not on how many women have access to alternatives. News stories Spangler sent us from the Texas Observer, a liberal-oriented news magazine, and from the Austin Chronicle weekly newspaper described women who relied solely on state services, but gave no numbers other than Legislative Budget Board projections, which include the assumption that the women would not find equivalent services elsewhere. Planned Parenthood officials in Texas whom Davis suggested we contact, as well as the group’s statewide public affairs coordinator, Dyana Limon-Mercado, said they could not estimate the exact number of women newly lacking access to services. Kelly Hart, director of public affairs for Dallas-based Planned Parenthood of North Texas, to whom we spoke by phone, described the difficulty in finding such an estimate: "Access" can depend on circumstances such as the woman’s income, her transportation options, how far away a clinic is and what hours it’s open. Another concern, perhaps particularly in pre-natal care, is how long women must wait for appointments. "At this point we don’t have the data," she said. In a 2010 fact-check, PolitiFact Texas gave a Mostly False rating to Gov. Rick Perry’s statement that "Everyone in this country has access to health care." Federal law requires hospitals to treat emergency medical conditions, and other avenues exist for non-emergency health concerns; however, many people cannot get to them and millions do not get the care they need. Texans’ state-funded options for family planning services could be further reduced if federal courts let the state enforce its February 2012 rule excluding Planned Parenthood clinics from Texas’ Medicaid-financed Women’s Health Program. That legal battle won’t be resolved until this fall at the earliest. But in any case it’s unclear how many Texas women would be affected: possibly more than 50,000, as the Statesman wrote in an April 17, 2012, news story, or perhaps none, if the state is able to fulfill its promise to serve the same number of women by taking over the program November 1, 2012, and operating it entirely with state dollars. Our ruling Davis overstated the number of women who have already lost services, at least as provided by State Health Services-supported clinics; the best information available suggests it’s closer to 83,000. Then again, through August 2013, the state projects that more than 200,000 women will lose access to the state's family planning services, and it seems likely they have few other options. We rate Davis’ statement Half True.	None	Wendy Davis	None	None	None	2012-06-27T14:42:21	2012-06-09	['Texas']
pomt-14586	"With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, (Sen. Rob) Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success’."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/feb/05/ted-strickland/job-losses-under-nafta-ohio-murky/	Ohio voters may have a sense of deja vu with some of the talking points rolled out by Ohio Senate candidate Ted Strickland. Strickland, the former Democratic governor, is again knocking opponents over job losses from the North American Free Trade Agreement. In a Facebook post about "skewed priorities," Strickland attacks Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican, for embracing the agreement as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush while criticizing the auto bailout. "With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success,’ " the post says. "With 160,000 auto jobs saved, Portman called the auto rescue a ‘lousy deal.’ " The attack about lost jobs from NAFTA sounded a lot like an attack PolitiFact Ohio checked out in the 2010 governor’s race against Republican John Kasich. Strickland’s campaign blamed NAFTA for a loss of 49,000 jobs to Mexico and 91,000 to China. (Kasich, of course, won the gubernatorial election and is now running for president. And Strickland’s claim rated False.) We wanted to know if NAFTA really killed a net 320,000 Ohio manufacturing jobs. NAFTA took effect Jan. 1, 1994, with the intent to smooth importing and exporting between Canada, the United States and Mexico. The deal is a big issue in Ohio, home to unions that are typically among NAFTA’s fiercest critics. Unions argue that trade deals like NAFTA send American jobs overseas. Portman indeed called NAFTA a "proven success" when he was the U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush in a 2006 news release. The news release didn’t say anything about lost jobs, though, so we kept digging. Strickland campaign spokesman David Bergstein confirmed that they sourced their data from the Washington-based think tank Public Citizen, founded by activist and former presidential candidate Ralph Nader. The data behind their findings, accessed Aug. 11, 2015, come partly from another left-leaning think tank, the Economic Policy Institute, and the nonpartisan, federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the report, Public Citizen claims, "Ohio has endured a net loss of more than 323,000 manufacturing jobs – one out of every three – since the 1994 NAFTA and the World Trade Organization agreements took effect." (The group has since reduced the figure of 323,000 jobs lost to 307,000 in a revised version.) But then, the report acknowledges that only some of those lost jobs are directly tied to overseas trade. "More than 139,000 specific Ohio jobs have been certified under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program as lost to offshoring or imports since NAFTA," the report says. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, part of the Department of Labor, provides federal aid to manufacturers who can prove that they lost revenue due to import policies like NAFTA. Subtracting the TAA-certified number of net jobs lost due to trade agreements -- 139,000 -- from the original figure of 323,000 jobs, leaves 184,000 jobs that were lost for reasons the report doesn’t, or can’t, explain. In fact, one of the sources cited in the Public Citizen report, the BLS, reports that in the first quarter of 2004, 10 years after NAFTA went into effect, just 4,633 of 239,361 private sector non-farm layoffs can be "associated with movement of work outside of the country." Economists say that other factors – say, a global economic downturn rivaling the Great Depression – also contribute to job losses. Ohio’s dip in employment was part of a nationwide trend from 2008 to 2011, when unemployment doubled from 5 to 10 percent. Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University, says that Wall Street has much more to do with the recession and associated job losses than NAFTA. Unemployment surged "largely due to the collapse of financial markets following the failure of risky bundled mortgage investments." Economists have also noted that shifts in employment in sectors like manufacturing or agriculture could also be attributed to technological breakthroughs that created jobs in some sectors and cost jobs in others, like when machines replace humans on the assembly line. In other words, the effects of NAFTA can’t be measured without considering all the other forces pushing and pulling the state’s economy. So noted the Congressional Research Service in its 2004 report about NAFTA 10 years out, which concludes, "NAFTA had little or no impact on aggregate employment." Our ruling Strickland said, "With 320,000 net Ohio manufacturing jobs lost, Portman calls NAFTA a ‘proven success.’ " The implication that NAFTA is solely responsible is a gross oversimplification of a very complex economic phenomenon. Just as one politician’s four-year term can’t be the sole cause of over a quarter-million lost jobs, the NAFTA trade deal isn’t wholly to blame either.

Now Walker’s allies in his 2014 re-election campaign are hoping to spread the pain to Democratic challenger Mary Burke. Burke, as Commerce secretary under Walker predecessor Jim Doyle, ran the predecessor agency to Walker’s Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. Now Burke’s record at the Commerce Department is under attack in a series of TV ads from the Republican Governors Association. The most recent came after a Burke ad claimed that "under Walker, unemployment’s up." We rated that Pants on Fire, noting unemployment has gone steadily down since Walker took office. "Burke is desperate to hide her failed record on jobs," the ad begins. The spot cites a 2007 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation into Commerce Department subsidies given to businesses that promised to create jobs. An announcer says: "What is clear is in Madison, Burke wasted millions of tax dollars, and promised jobs didn’t materialize." Two quotes attributed to the newspaper are featured on-screen, including "Major shortcomings" and "40% of jobs … failed to materialize." We’re not going to fact check whether millions was "wasted" in the subsidy programs. There’s considerable disagreement on whether such programs work or are necessary, even when promised jobs get created. So in some respects that is a matter of opinion. But we decided to take a look at how the RGA was characterizing the Journal Sentinel’s work and Burke’s role in the problems it noted. About the program Subsidy programs for corporations have proliferated since Wisconsin began providing grants, tax credits and forgivable loans in the 1980s to keep businesses from fleeing the state, the Journal Sentinel reported in that 2007 series. The taxpayer-provided aid, about $50 million a year as of 2007, generally comes with some strings: creating or preserving jobs, or helping low-income areas, the stories said. Now, back to the RGA’s TV spot. The Journal Sentinel series, "Subsidies Without Scrutiny," found 40% of jobs promised by 25 firms that won $80 million in state aid over a six-year period "failed to materialize," a Journal Sentinel follow-up story noted on July 5, 2007. The RGA ad cites this follow-up story specifically. The group of 25 firms included the 10 largest aid recipients, accounting for roughly one-fourth of all business subsidies given. The series also found what were termed "major shortcomings" in state subsidy records. Firms receiving help rarely complied with their aid agreements, state officials routinely eased rules for business recipients and no reliable process existed to track success or failure, it found. Many of the state subsidy files examined by the Journal Sentinel were in disarray, the series found. Companies were supposed to file with the agency annual or semiannual progress reports on job creation. But many of the reports were late or missing. That hobbled the Commerce Department's ability to tally how successful its aid programs had been, the paper found. (It’s worth noting, in addition, that that the stories took a snapshot of the job creation as of 2007, but additional jobs may have been created or lost since then at the firms receiving aid. The 40 percent figure has not been updated). In short, the RGA’s claim accurately, if ever so briefly, summarizes the problems in the business-aid programs identified by the newspaper. How much responsibility? A trickier question is what was Burke’s role in this. The newspaper examined information on subsidies dating from January 2000 to March 2006. Doyle tapped Burke in February 2005 to run Commerce and she left in November 2007. So how much responsibility does she bear? There’s no doubt Burke was in charge when some of the incentives examined by the newspaper were initially granted. It’s also clear that many of the 25 firms won approval for state help before Burke was on the scene -- 70 percent, we found in looking back at the reporting of the 2007 Journal Sentinel series. Many of the deals originated earlier under Doyle or even before that under Republican Governors Tommy Thompson and Scott McCallum. Still, even on many of those older subsidy arrangements, Burke would have been responsible for monitoring the promised jobs and handing out the money. That’s because the money was portioned out as jobs were created, often over up to a seven-year period. In the 2007 Journal Sentinel series, Burke took responsibility for some problems, defended the program in general and pointed out specific successes. She blamed tight budgets for record-keeping she acknowledged had shortcomings. She argued that the incentives are necessary in some cases just to preserve jobs at a company weighing lucrative offers from other states. "They need to see a sign ... that we value their presence," Burke said in 2007. Burke said at the time that improvements were underway in tracking firms’ progress on jobs goals. She also noted at the time that one safeguard in place was that companies can’t claim tax credits unless they meet job goals. The newspaper, however, found companies often got tax credits for preserving old jobs as well as for creating new ones and that companies routinely got more time to meet job goals than contracts specified. The paper’s findings mirrored those of an earlier legislative audit that examined various state economic development programs in a narrower period than the newspaper’s review. The state audit looked at mid-2003 to mid-2005. That period overlaps Burke’s tenure, but by just six months. The 2006 audit found: • Insurance companies claimed more than $29 million in tax credits over six years under a program that created just 316 jobs. For each job created, taxpayers spent $91,871 — far more than what they spent to create jobs in other programs. The audit found a wide range in the cost of creating or retaining jobs under other programs, from a low of $556 to a high of $22,727 per job. • At least two companies laid off employees within three years of receiving state grants. The state does little long-term follow-up with grant recipients and so is unaware of other such examples, auditors said. • The state Department of Commerce did not adequately follow up on the performance of companies that received assistance. Its regular reports to the Legislature detailed expected outcomes, rather than results. In response to the audit, Burke, whose job was to oversee many of the state’s economic development programs, said in 2006 that the audit made welcome recommendations on improving reporting and streamlining the programs. But she said the state was doing a good job in getting money to the right businesses. Doyle, in the wake of the audit, acknowledged that targeting money to the right areas can be difficult. "What you really have to do is make sure that the grants that are going out are going to companies that have good plans. . . . (But) you can never predict exactly what the future is," he said. "You’ve got to have smart people who are really looking at whether the applications are ones that show real promise." Our rating The Republican Governors Association said that under Burke, Commerce Department business-incentive programs had "major shortcomings" and "40 percent of jobs … didn’t materialize." The programs did have significant problems, some acknowledged by Burke at the time. And the 40 percent figure is accurately drawn from the Journal Sentinel series that sampled the job-creation progress for 25 companies. But the ad’s claim needs clarification in that the newspaper series focused mainly on deals that originated before Burke took office, though she was responsible for overseeing the disbursal of money. That fact puts some of the blame on Burke’s predecessors. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Republican Governors Association	None	None	None	2014-04-03T05:00:00	2014-03-17	['None']
pomt-09384	"The American people will be appalled to learn the health care bill exempts (congressional) leadership and committee staff."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/26/tom-coburn/health-bill-appears-exempt-some-congressional-staf/	Since President Barack Obama signed the health care bill into law, we've seen many criticisms that some congressional staffers are exempt from buying health coverage through an insurance exchange. Here's the latest iteration from Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn: "The American people will be appalled to learn the health care bill exempts leadership and committee staff," Coburn told a group of reporters on March 23, 2010. "This special deal for unelected staff underscores everything the public detests about the arrogance of power in Washington." Conservative bloggers have picked up on the issue as well. Ben Domenech of the New Ledger wrote on March 22, 2010, that a surprise "is found on page 158 of the legislation, which appears to create a carve-out for senior staff members in the leadership offices and on congressional committees, essentially exempting those senior Democrat staffers who wrote the bill from being forced to purchase health care plans in the same way as other Americans." The issue has even become the subject of a poll on Facebook that states, "The staffers who wrote Obamacare slipped in a hidden gem: They exempted themselves, Obama, and his staff from the new regulations. Should this exemption be repealed?" We should note here that the new requirements in the bill do not, and never have applied to the president, vice president and members of the administration, though there have been legislative efforts to change that. And the Associated Press reported on March 24 that Obama plans to get his health care through the exchange. Coburn's quote may make it sound like lawmakers and congressional staff are exempt from broader health care reform, but they are not. Instead, he's talking about a specific provision in the bill that would require lawmakers and their staff to buy health insurance through an exchange, a virtual marketplace where consumers can pick and choose among plans based on coverage and price. To our knowledge, members of Congress and their aides are the only people who are being forced to give up their employer's health care plan -- in this case, one administered by the federal government. To check Coburn's claim, we turned to page 158 of the health care bill Obama just signed -- the Senate version of the bill -- and here's what it says: "The only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are — (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act)." The provision goes on: "The term 'Member of Congress' means any member of the House of Representatives or the Senate... The term 'congressional staff' means all full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress, whether in Washington, DC or outside of Washington, DC." The history of this provision deserves some attention. In the summer of 2009, when the lawmakers were in a heated debate over whether the health care bill should create the public option, a government-run health care plan, Coburn and his Republican colleague Charles Grassley argued that if Democrats were so keen on creating new health care programs, the president, administration officials, members of Congress and their staff should also be required to participate. Up until this point, members of Congress and their staff have been enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, which offers employees a stipend to cover the cost of their health insurance. Now, staff will use that subsidy to buy a plan through the exchange. The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee adopted a Coburn amendment that would have required lawmakers and their staff to enroll in the public option, while the Finance Committee incorporated a proposal by Grassley that would have required lawmakers and their staff to participate in the health insurance exchange. Over the next couple of months, Senate leadership merged the two bills. The legislation that ended up on the floor included the above language. Coburn and Grassley contend that the Senate leadership made some subtle but important changes to the language in the process, rephrasing the definition of "congressional staff" from "an employee whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of Representatives," which was in the Finance Committee bill, to "full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress, whether in Washington, DC or outside of Washington, DC" -- the same exact definition included in the HELP committee bill as a result of Coburn's amendment. So, what's the big deal about semantics? Coburn and Grassley argue that the narrow definition of "congressional staff" as someone who works for a member of Congress excludes higher-paid committee aides and leadership aides. Grassley and Coburn tried in December to offer an amendment to the Senate bill that would have broadened the definition of a congressional staffer and include the president, vice president and political appointees in the executive branch in the requirement, but the duo say they were prevented from offering it. Coburn and Grassley tried again to expand the definition during the latest round of discussions over a package of "fixes" to the new health care law, but the amendment was defeated. We should note that Coburn and Grassley have implied that changes to the provision were the result of back-room dealings. While we know that the provision did morph over time, we don't know exactly why or under what circumstances. What we are checking is whether the language excludes committee and leadership staff as Coburn says. A report issued by the Congressional Research Service, on Dec. 2, 2009, at Grassley's request provides this insight: "It appears possible to argue that the definition of 'congressional staff' used . . . excludes any staff not directly affiliated with a Member’s individual or personal office," the independent research office concluded. "Should this interpretation be adopted by an implementing body or a court, it would appear that it would exclude professional committee staff, joint committee staff, some shared staff, as well as potentially those staff employed by leadership offices including, but not limited to, the Speaker of the House, Majority Leader of the Senate, Minority Leader of the House, Minority Leader of the Senate, as well as the Whip offices in both the House and Senate. Moreover, this interpretation would arguably exclude other congressional employees, for example, those employed by the Office of the House Clerk, House Parliamentarian, House Historian, Secretary of the Senate, Senate Legal Counsel, House and Senate Legislative Counsel offices." In an e-mail, Jim Manley, spokesman for Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, pointed out that the final language reflects Coburn's original proposal from the summer of 2009. He went further with Roll Call and Politico, saying that the provision does not apply to committee staff, but that leadership staff may not be exempted. When the two bills were merged, they chose Coburn's language over Grassley's because leadership was worried that Grassley's proposal was too broad; it may have required legislative counsel and employees of the Architect of the Capitol to participate as well, Manley said. So, that brings us back to Coburn's claim that committee and leadership staff are excluded from new rules in the health care bill. He is correct that the bill does not clearly include committee and leadership staff, and a CRS report unequivocally backs this concern. However, we quibble with two things: First, Coburn is quite definitive in his conclusion that committee and leadership staff are exempted. But the CRS report provides more wiggle room; it states "it appears possible" that the language could be interpreted that way. It would have been more accurate to say that the language "may exempt" some staffers. Furthermore, it is true that Coburn's original amendment language was as restrictive as the provision that ended up in the final version of the bill. However, on two occasions, Coburn tried to fix the problem. All that said, we find Coburn's claim to be Mostly True.	None	Tom Coburn	None	None	None	2010-03-26T18:02:53	2010-03-23	['United_States']
pomt-01319	Ebola is "incredibly contagious," "very transmissible" and "easy to catch."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/27/rand-paul/ebola-virus-incredibly-contagious-and-easy-catch-r/	Count Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., among Republicans who don’t think the White House has taken the Ebola threat seriously enough. While campaigning for Republicans in New Hampshire on Oct. 16, Paul told Concord News Radio that President Barack Obama "has so tried to downplay the transmissibility of" the Ebola virus that it’s putting people at risk. "This is an incredibly contagious disease," Paul said. "People in full gloves and gowns are getting it. So really they need to be honest — this is a very transmissible disease." Paul added: "They’re still learning about this. We’re all still learning about this. But this is not something that is hard to catch, this is something that appears to be very easy to catch." Is the Ebola virus "incredibly contagious," "very transmissible" and "easy to catch"? We decided to check it out. Paul’s office said his comments implied that he was talking about how easy it is to get the virus from contact with an infected individual. In a lengthy response to PolitiFact, spokesman Brian Darling said that "exposure to even a small amount of virus can cause infection." The 2014 outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa is the largest in history, according to the World Health Organization. It’s also the first time the virus has made its way to the United States; health officials confirmed the fourth U.S. case Thursday in a doctor returning to New York from treating Ebola patients in West Africa. So far, though, only two individuals — both Texas health care workers that treated an African man who later died from the disease — have contracted the virus on U.S. soil. This despite the fact that infected individuals have come into contact with dozens, if not hundreds, of people while they purportedly had the disease, including close family members. That seems to dispel, at least anecdotally, the idea that the disease is "incredibly contagious" and "easy to catch," even from an infected person. But let’s get into the nitty gritty. How does Ebola spread? Ebola is not an airborne infection. For example, it is rare — if it’s even possible at all — that the disease would spread through coughing or sneezing (which are not even symptoms of Ebola, as our colleagues at PunditFact recently noted). According to the World Health Organization, Ebola spreads through "human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people." This means that the most common way Ebola is spread is direct contact with vomit, blood or fecal matter of an infected patient. Individuals who have such contact are at high risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says "being within approximately 3 feet of an (Ebola) patient or within the patient’s room or care area for a prolonged period of time," is also potential cause for concern. But the organization noted the risk is low. There is also potential risk of transmission through contaminated surfaces and objects, however the World Health Organization notes the danger is, again, low, and most studies from previous Ebola outbreaks show that "all cases were infected by direct close contact with symptomatic patients." Finally, experts note that individuals are not infectious — meaning they cannot spread the virus — until they are showing symptoms, which takes between 2 and 21 days. Symptoms start with a fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. So to be at a high risk of contracting Ebola, you need to come into contact with the blood, feces or vomit of someone who is showing symptoms. The number of people who find themselves in this situation are relatively small. There is potential for it to spread other ways — such as being in close range with someone who has the disease or touching an object contaminated by an infected person — but the risk is low, because "as an enveloped virus, it has a low tendency to stay viable outside the body," said Thomas Fekete, a professor of infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine. "And because it is not aerosolized it isn't especially easy to catch through the respiratory tract." How contagious is it? The CDC defines contagious as "a very communicable disease capable of spreading rapidly from one person to another by contact or close proximity." In Africa, the disease has claimed so many victims because of poor health systems that lack supplies and safeguards and because of burial practices where people directly handle bodies without necessary protections. This is what caused such a large outbreak there. Burials are especially problematic because the near dead or recently dead have very high levels of the virus and are "very infectious as a result," said Christopher Whalen, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Georgia College of Public Health. But even in the worst outbreak Africa has experienced, health care officials have noted that the disease does not spread from one host to many others. The basic reproduction number, or R0, of a disease is calculated as the average number of secondary cases resulting from an infected individual entering an uninfected population. The higher the R0 is above 1, the greater the chances it has of spreading. The R0 of the Ebola virus in Africa during the recent outbreak has ranged from 1.20 to 2.02, depending on the country. That’s in line with historical data on the disease. How does that compare to other viruses? Well, HIV, which is only transmitted by sexual intercourse and blood transfers, has a R0 of 4. The measles has a R0 of 18. Meaning, while the disease has the potential to spread, "minimum requirements for the containment of Ebola are far less severe than for the containment of more contagious diseases, such as measles," according to the World Health Organization Ebola Response Team. Rachael Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago School of Public Health, told PolitiFact: "The epidemiological evidence suggests that Ebola is less infectious than many other viruses that commonly affect people, such as influenza." What if you come in contact with someone who has Ebola? Ebola is "easy to catch" in the sense that you don't need prolonged contact with infected fluids to pick it up, Fekete said. However, not many people come in contact with these infected fluids. And, the evidence shows some people who do spend time around an infected patient don’t get the virus, either. "It seems as though even a brief exposure to the virus can lead to a transmission event, as some patients describe one contact event with an ill patient," Whalen said. "But, on the other side, think of all of the family members of Ebola patients who were exposed in the household of a case, but didn’t develop the disease. We tend not to hear about them, yet they constitute an important part of our understanding the attack rate." But Paul’s spokesman, Darling, argued, "The reason why doctors and nurses who come into contact with an infected individual wear 100 percent protection then have to go through a thorough disinfection process, is because it is ‘easy to catch’ from somebody who is showing symptoms." That’s not necessarily the case, according to health experts we spoke with. For one, health care workers are in close contact with infected individuals at their most infectious state and are handling bodily fluids known to carry higher concentrations of the virus. That puts them at greater risk than someone sitting next to a person who is infected, even if that person is showing symptoms. Further, unlike much more contagious diseases, Ebola causes death in 50 percent of patients. That sparks extra precaution. "These recommendations arise from the seriousness of the infection, not from the infectivity of the pathogen," Jones said. Given the high mortality rate from the disease, if it was "incredibly contagious" and "easy to catch," the United States would likely have more deaths already. "The joke that more Americans have been married to Kim Kardashian than have died of Ebola would not be true if it were so easy to catch," Fekete said. Our ruling Paul called Ebola "incredibly contagious," "very transmissible" and "easy to catch." A person who comes into contact with bodily fluids from an Ebola patient for a short period can contract the virus. In that limited sense, Ebola is "easy to catch." Health care workers and individuals handling patients at or near death are also at greater risk, because that appears to be when the disease is at its most infectious, experts said. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that Ebola is less contagious and transmissible than many other diseases. By the numbers, Ebola patients go on to infect relatively few people. This is because a patient only spreads the disease while showing symptoms; the virus cannot be spread through the air; and people don’t often come into contact with the bodily fluids of other individuals. Contracting the disease through other methods, like touching surfaces or standing close to infected patients, while possible, are rare and present a low risk. Ebola is a serious and deadly disease that is absolutely capable of spreading if necessary precautions aren’t taken. But in using words like "incredibly," "very" and "easy," Paul vastly inflates the virus’ ability to move from person to person. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-01279	The last time Republican U.S. Senate candidates "beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/02/sean-spicer/last-time-gop-defeated-two-senate-incumbent-democr/	For the past couple decades, Republicans have struggled to oust Democratic senators, though that trend is expected to change Tuesday. Many forecasters have Republicans taking up to eight Democratic Senate seats -- beating incumbents in Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska and Colorado. If this scenario pans out, Republicans will gain control of the Senate, and they will have overcome a historical challenge. "The last time we beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980," said Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer on CNN’s State of the Union on Nov. 2. It’s commonly understood that incumbent candidates have an advantage over their challengers for many reasons including visibility, accomplishments in the position, and being a high-quality candidate (why they were elected in the first place). But have Republican challengers really struggled so much to take Democratic seats? We looked at past Senate election results and found that Republicans have had some successful gains in the past 35 years, but many of those wins were in races for an open seat when a Democratic senator was retiring. In 1980, Republicans took 12 Democrat Senate seats (nine incumbents lost in the general election, while three lost in their primaries.). Spicer is correct to say they haven’t beat more than two incumbents since then. We found a great chart showing Senate seat turnover for the past half-century in the Brookings Institution’s most recent "Vital Statistics on Congress" report. (h/t to Sabato’s Crystal Ball.) The arrows show when a Democratic (D) seat switched to a Republican (R) seat and vice versa. From 1981 on, Republicans have beaten only 12 incumbent Democrats for Senate seats. Republicans’ biggest Senate gains in that time frame all involve taking open seats -- such as 1994, 2004 and 2010, when they gained four, five and six open seats, respectively. Senate Democrats haven’t had quite the same struggle against Republican incumbents in recent years. Since 1981, they’ve beaten 37 incumbents total, compared to Republicans’ 12. So if Republicans are able to beat more than two incumbent Democratic senators Tuesday, it would be a clear break with the recent past. If Republicans take seven seats, both beating incumbents and taking open seats (which the New York Times’ election model has as the most likely outcome), that will be their second-biggest overall gain since 1980. In 1994, Republicans won eight Senate seats -- beating two incumbents and taking six open seats. What made 1980 so special? In the same election, former President Ronald Reagan beat incumbent Democrat President Jimmy Carter. Carter was fast falling out of favor with voters, considering the Iran hostage crisis, a floundering economy and other issues. On top of Carter’s struggles, there was a major rift between Southern and Northern Democrats. It was an extraordinary political environment that allowed Republicans to sweep the congressional elections. Compare that to this year’s Senate elections where, although there is no presidential election, Republicans are using President Barack Obama’s relatively low popularity to their advantage in races against incumbent Democrats. Our ruling Spicer said the last time Republican Senate candidates "beat more than two (incumbents) was 1980." Republicans kicked a total of 9 incumbent Democrats out of office in 1980 (another three lost in a primary). Since then, Republicans have turned two or fewer seats each election. Most of their success has been in winning formerly Democratic open seats. We rate Spicer’s claim True.

pomt-03573	Historically, the Social Security tax has been assessed on about 90% of U.S. income. Now it captures 83% because there's been such a growth of income among the highest earners.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/19/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-only-83-percent-income/	The question of how to properly finance Social Security was one of the topics when U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was interviewed on WPRI's "Newsmakers," which aired May 12, 2013. Cicilline expressed support for one proposal that would eliminate the limit on the Social Security payroll tax. Currently, employees stop paying the 6.2-percent tax for the year once their income hits $113,700. Applying the tax to everyone regardless of their income would keep Social Security solvent for the next 75 years, according to the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration. On "Newsmakers," Cicilline said more and more income is now exempt from the tax. "Social Security used to be a tax which was assessed on approximately 90 percent of the income generated in this country, which was where it has sort of been historically. It currently collects taxes on about 83 percent of wages earned because the cap . . . only captures 83 percent of earnings because there's been such a growth of income at the very top," the congressman said. We were interested in seeing if his percentages were correct. We didn't get an immediate response from his office, so we went looking on our own. According to a Social Security "Policy Brief" from 2011, and other sources, Social Security sometimes refers to this limit as the "tax max." It's been the subject of a lot of tinkering since the 1930s, when it was set at $3,000. The tax rate then was just one percent. The tax max started going up in 1951. Annual increases began in 1972. The tax rate itself started to rise in 1950. It has been 6.2 percent since 1990. Returning to Cicilline's statement, we found that he got a key number wrong. He said that, historically, 90 percent of income was subject to the Social Security tax. In fact, 83 percent is the average proportion of wages subjected to the tax from the founding of Social Security through 2009. For several years during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s it was below 80 percent, dropping to 71 percent in 1965. The percentage peaked at 90 percent in only two years -- 1982 and 1983. It's been on the decline since then. It was about 86 percent in 2010. Cicilline's office subsequently sent us two reports that confirmed the 90 percent represents a historical peak, not an average. One was a 2010 document from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which predicted that the rate would hit 83 percent around 2014. The other was a compilation of statistical tables from the Social Security Administration showing that the 2011 rate was expected to be 83 percent, as Cicilline said. The reports showed something else. Since 1983, about 6 percent of the population each year has earned enough money to reach the cap and stop paying Social Security taxes that year. The fact that the percentage has changed very little (yet the amount of wages subjected to the Social Security tax has steadily declined) shows that the wealthiest Americans have been seeing less and less of their income subjected to the tax, which was Cicilline's other point. As the 2011 policy brief concluded, "The percentage of earnings covered by the tax max has fallen since the early 1980s because earnings among above-max earners have grown faster than earnings among the rest of the working population." One final interesting note for the folks in Cicilline's home state: the Congressional Research Service report has a state-by-state breakdown of the percentage of workers with income subject to the Social Security tax who exceeded the limit in 2007. Rhode Island had the fewest workers -- only 1.6 percent in that category. South Dakota was next to the bottom, at 2.1 percent. New Jersey was highest at 11.6 percent. Our ruling U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said only 83 percent of wages are being subjected to the Social Security tax when, historically, it has been 90 percent. Analyses by the Social Security Administration and the Congressional Research Service show that he is on the mark for the current rate of taxation, but 90 percent applies to only two years in the 1980s. It has been declining since then, as better-paid Americans have seen their incomes grow at a faster rate than other workers. The judges felt that Cicilline needed to get both facts correct to make his point. When a key part of his premise turns out to be inaccurate, his overarching argument fails.

pomt-09056	"The majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/30/jan-brewer/arizona-gov-brewer-says-majority-illegals-are-drug/	Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer created a frenzy in April 2010 when she signed a law that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires legal immigrants to carry papers that confirm their status. Then in late June, she linked illegal immigrants and drug smuggling. The string of controversial comments began June 15, 2010, during a debate with three other candidates running for the Republican nomination for governor. Republican candidate Matt Jette said that most people who cross illegally into Arizona are "just trying to feed their families." Brewer, according to the Arizona Republic, disputed that, saying, "They're coming here, and they're bringing drugs. And they're doing drop houses, and they're extorting people and they're terrorizing the families." A few days later, on June 25, Brewer expanded upon her comments during a question-and-answer session with reporters. (A verbatim account of the exchange is available here.) "Well, we all know that the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules," Brewer said. "They're coming across our borders in huge numbers. The drug cartels have taken control of the immigration. … So they are criminals. They're breaking the law when they are trespassing and they're criminals when they pack the marijuana and the drugs on their backs." Brewer added, "I believe today and in the circumstances that we are facing, that the majority of the illegal trespassers that are coming in the state of Arizona are under the direction and control of organized drug cartels, and they are bringing drugs in." Finally, later the same day, Brewer released a statement clarifying her comments for a second time. "There has been some media attention in the last several hours regarding statements I made this morning regarding the level of drug and crime activity being perpetrated by illegal immigrants coming into and residing in Arizona. The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels, which are by definition smuggling drugs," the statement said. "It is common knowledge that Mexican drug cartels have merged human smuggling with drug trafficking. For example, the Los Angeles Times on March 23, 2009, reported, 'The business of smuggling humans across the Mexican border has been brisk, with many thousands coming across every year. But smugglers affiliated with the drug cartels have taken the enterprise to a new level – and made it more violent – by commandeering much of the operation from independent coyotes, according to these officials and recent congressional testimonies.' This article and many federal government reports have drawn the same conclusions. "The human rights violations that have taken place victimizing immigrants and their families are abhorrent. Border crossers are used by drug cartels as commodities. Mexican drug cartels have merged human smugglers who use their expertise in gathering intelligence on border patrols, logistics and communication devices to get around even tighter controls. U.S. border officials have stated that traffickers are gaining control of much of the illegal passage of immigrants from Mexico to the United States." Though Brewer did not use her written statement to retract any of her prior comments, she did change her focus a bit, singling out the criminal elements running joint drug-and-human smuggling operations rather than the immigrants that the cartels have been, in her words, "victimizing." Whether or not this represents a backpedaling, we thought her earlier comments deserve scrutiny because they raise an interesting question -- whether there is a substantial connection between illegal immigrants and drug smuggling. So we talked to experts and looked over statistical data to see whether Brewer was justified in claiming that "the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules." The governor's staff did not respond to PolitiFact's request for comment, nor did Customs and Border Protection. But most of the experts we spoke to agreed with the notion, raised in the Los Angeles Times article and by Brewer, that there is growing overlap between drug smuggling and human smuggling. "Because of the militarization of the border and the increased difficulty in crossing, most border-crossers turn to 'coyotes,' " or human smugglers, said Aarti Kohli, the director of immigration policy and legislative counsel for the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Race, Ethnicity, and Diversity at the University of California (Berkeley) School of Law. "Sometimes these coyotes have links with drug cartels and are engaging in drug smuggling along with alien smuggling. Both are federal offenses." That said, Kohli and others draw a clear distinction with Brewer's suggestion that the majority of illegal border crossers are "drug mules." "If caught along the southwest border, the vast majority of migrants are prosecuted in federal district court, often 70 at a time, for misdemeanor illegal entry," Kohli said. "If they are caught smuggling drugs, they would not be prosecuted" in this way. Federal statistics bear this out. We looked at the latest available statistics, covering March 2010, for prosecutions stemming from immigrations and customs activities by the Department of Homeland Security. They show that "immigration" charges accounted for almost 89 percent of cases, while drug and drug-trafficking charges accounted for just over 5 percent. "These apprehensions do not catch everyone, obviously, but as the Border Patrol is particularly interested in interdicting contraband, I don't know of any strong reason to believe that the Border Patrol's arrests would have a disproportionately low share of smugglers," said Gabriel "Jack" Chin, a professor of law, public administration and policy at the University of Arizona. The statistics also track with accounts of law enforcement sources. "Based on conversations with front-line Border Patrol agents, it is clear that the majority of people encountered by the Border Patrol are not carrying drugs," said T.J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council. "While it is true that the majority of human smuggling is controlled or at least regulated by the cartels, it does not logically follow that the majority of people who are smuggled by the cartels are therefore transporting drugs. The penalties for transporting drugs are far greater than the penalties for entering the country illegally, so people do not engage in that type of criminal behavior unless they are so inclined, are extremely desperate or are coerced by the cartels. The two latter categories are the exceptions rather than the rule." On the broader issue, it's worth noting that statistics have consistently shown that immigrants, including illegal immigrants, actually have lower rates of criminal activity and incarceration than do the native-born children of immigrants. Rubén G. Rumbaut, a sociologist at the University of California (Irvine), has written that 2000 Census figures show consistently lower incarceration rates for foreign-born Mexicans, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Colombians, Ecuadorians and Peruvians when compared to incarceration rates of U.S.-born members of the same ethnic groups. While the category "foreign-born" is not identical to "illegal immigrant," there is significant overlap in these particular ethnic groups, Rumbaut writes. Ultimately, Brewer would have been on safe ground if she'd said that drug smuggling and human smuggling have become increasingly intertwined, and that sometimes, illegal immigrants have been coerced into serving as drug couriers. But that's a much more limited claim than what she initially said -- that "the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules." While the source she eventually cited -- the Los Angeles Times -- says that "sometimes (smugglers) loaded up their human cargo with backpacks full of marijuana," the article doesn't back up her assertion that that "the majority" of illegal immigrants carry drugs into the country. More to the point, Brewer's contention is undercut by both federal prosecution statistics and the accounts of experts we spoke to. So we rate Brewer's statement False.

pomt-00099	Says Texas Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher contradicted herself on her health care position by saying "we need universal health care."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/30/john-culberson/lizzie-fletcher-does-not-want-government-funded-un/	A new ad from John Culberson, a nine-term Republican congressman from Texas, takes an ad from his opponent Lizzie Pannill Fletcher and uses her own words against her. Culberson is looking to hold onto his seat in the state’s 7th Congressional District, which covers a portion of western Houston. His campaign aired the ad "Orders" which puts up a Fletcher ad and compares it to comments she made in a debate. The 30-second slot begins with a clip of Fletcher in her ad saying she doesn’t "support a government takeover of health care." Then, it immediately switches to a clip of Fletcher in a debate saying "we need universal health care." With such a stark contrast, we wondered whether Fletcher had backtracked on her position, as the ad makes it appear. While universal health care refers to any system where all residents have health coverage, it is best connected, at least right now, to the single-payer plan "Medicare for All" that was proposed in 2017 by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. So does Fletcher support a government-supported, universal single-payer system like Medicare for All? No. The debate clip is cut, and takes Fletcher out of context by not revealing her full quote. We also found Fletcher has voiced opposition to such a program several times. Medicare for All, a quick recap Under Sanders’ plan, the country would eliminate the current system of multiple insurers competing for premiums. Instead, the government would expand Medicare, a federally tax-payer supported program, to cover everyone, rather than just those age 65 and older. Backers say the plan would end up saving people money, because it would cut administrative costs, help slow the increase in health care spending and improve access. But skeptics argue that it would be too costly for the federal government, result in lower quality care and would amount to a "government takeover" of health care. What Fletcher said (and supports) We tracked down the full video of the debate from May 2018, and found that Fletcher was responding to her Democratic primary opponent at the time, Laura Moser, who had said she backed a single-payer program like "Medicare for All". Fletcher disagreed. Fletcher did say "we need universal health care" but if you continue to watch, you see that’s not exactly what she meant. "We need universal health care. Not just health care coverage, not just health care insurance, but that we all need access to health care," she goes on to say. Fletcher then discusses her support of keeping the Affordable Care Act and adding a public option to buy into Medicare – not Medicare for All or any other single-payer plan. "There has been extensive study that the plan Bernie Sanders has proposed will cost $32 trillion over 10 years," Fletcher said, "and we don’t know how we’re going to pay for it." (She is referring to a study from the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank at George Mason University, that estimated Medicare for All would increase the demand for health care services while also cutting payments to providers. The report suggests the system would cost $32 trillion over the next 10 years) The Fletcher campaign also told us she has never advocated for a "complete government takeover" of health care. That checks out. We looked into Fletcher’s stance on health care and reviewed various reports, as well as her remarks in interviews and information on her campaign website. In every instance, Fletcher has repeated that she wants to build on the Affordable Care Act, and has not endorsed any single-payer health care system, including Medicare for All. The Culberson campaign defended the ad by saying that universal health care isn’t universal access to health care. "Because health care is already available to everyone in America – you just have to pay for it," said Culberson spokesperson Catherine Kelly. "Her plan is more expensive than Medicare for All because it raises taxes on people who want to keep their coverage and gives it to people to anyone who wants to 'opt in.’" Our ruling Culberson attempts to display Fletcher contradicting herself on her health care position. But the ad uses an incomplete sound bite that ultimately takes Fletcher out of context. Fletcher did use the words "universal health care," and has so in the past, but not in the context of a single-payer or "Medicare for All" type health plan. Fletcher has advocated for improvements to the Affordable Care Act and a public option to buy into Medicare, not through a government-funded single-payer type of program. The ad uses an incomplete sound bite that ultimately misleads viewers on her stance. We rate it False.

pomt-05552	Says his reform efforts improved performance at all 10 low-performing schools in Palm Beach, Florida.	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/08/jeffrey-hernandez/consultant-says-his-efforts-improved-performance-a/	In the quest to improve its struggling school system, Providence voted at the end of March to spend $5 million in federal money to hire consultant Jeffrey Hernandez to help reform three struggling high schools. His appointment in Providence was controversial because his stint in Palm Beach, Florida, sparked strong criticism from parents and teachers and he resigned after only a year on the job. Hernandez bills himself as an agent for transforming low-performing schools. Part of his sales pitch to the Providence School Committee was a six-page letter, dated March 23, 2012, that talks about his experience as chief academic officer for the Palm Beach County school district. "One of the goals I was charged with was to improve the student achievement at our 10 lowest performing high schools, which were in Corrective Action under Florida's Differentiated Accountability. After implementing rigorous and robust strategic reform initiatives, 100% of the high schools improved their performance as evidenced by all of them receiving a grade of 'C' or higher (mostly 'A' and 'B')," he wrote. After seeing his claim summarized in a March 26 Journal story about the controversy surrounding his then-pending appointment, we decided to check his claim. His letter includes a chart detailing improvements -- some substantial -- in the letter grade given to each school by the Florida Department of Education. "The grade improvements above are one of the many transformations that NAEP Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey J. Hernandez was responsible for as a district administrator," the chart says. NAEP is National Academic Educational Partners Inc. During the 2009-2010 school year, Hernandez was Palm Beach County's chief academic officer. We confirmed all the grades with the Florida Department of Education, although the dates given in the chart are misleading. (It suggests the results compare the two school years from 2009-2011; it's actually 2008-2010.) Among the seven high schools that had a D rating in 2009, when Hernandez began his job at the district, two rose to a C in 2010, three increased to a B and two jumped to an A. Among the three C-level schools, two rose to a B and one jumped to an A. (The 11th school started out with a ranking of B and jumped to an A.) Overall, 54 percent of the schools showed a higher grade and none showed a lower ranking. That's pretty impressive. But was Hernandez, who was employed by the district for just one year, responsible? For comparison, we looked at the grades for high schools in Broward County, just to the south of Palm Beach County. It turns out that those schools had a great year as well -- without Hernandez's involvement. In the Broward County school system, 53 percent of the 34 high schools got a higher grade in the spring of 2010 while 3 percent (one school) showed a decline. So we looked at all Florida high schools, excluding those in Palm Beach for that time period. Just over half -- 51 percent -- saw their grades increase for 2010. So not only were the Palm Beach high schools getting better grades when Hernandez was in charge of academics, schools throughout Florida were getting higher scores as well. The reason: the state changed its grading system. For example, the formula used to determine a school's grade began including graduation rates and accelerated course work. "I would expect to see a difference between '08-'09 and '09-'10 because the formula for high school grades changed in that time frame," said Jane Fletcher, director of accountability and policy research at the Florida Department of Education. "It's not surprising at all." When we called Hernandez to ask about the grade inflation statewide, he said, "I can't say what was happening in other districts. I can only say what happened in the district that I was working on." We did see one difference between Hernandez's district and the rest of Florida. Palm Beach high schools showed a greater propensity to improve more than one letter grade. While 16 percent of Florida's high schools showed a jump of two or more letter grades (such as from a D to a B), 27 percent of Palm Beach schools made that type of jump. Our ruling Jeffrey Hernandez said that after implementing his reform measures, "100% of the [10 lowest performing high schools in Palm Beach] improved their performance as evidenced by all of them receiving a grade of 'C' or higher." He is correct that there was improvement -- those low-performing schools did pull better grades (two went from a D to an A). But that was part of a larger trend, prompted by a change in the grading system, that caused half of all high schools throughout the state to score better. We think that's an key omission, one that Hernandez should be making clear when he talks about his record and one that Providence should have known about when the School Department decided to hire him.

pomt-14098	Says Ted Strickland admits his record on jobs and taxes is "mixed and spotty."	false	/ohio/statements/2016/may/13/fighting-ohio-pac/fighting-ohio-pac-ad-takes-ted-stricklands-mixed-a/	A campaign ad by the political action committee supporting Republican Sen. Rob Portman features a video clip of his opponent, former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, a Democrat, saying, "My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that," before the ad launches into attacks on his economic record. The narrator says that Strickland is speaking "on his record," then slams Strickland for 350,000 jobs lost and $8 million in taxes raised. PolitiFact Ohio has checked those two figures before and rated the claims Half True and Mostly True, respectively. Now we’d like to know where Fighting for Ohio got that "mixed and spotty" clip. Did the former Ohio governor really fall on his sword over the economic upshot of his tenure? No, he didn’t. The ad takes Strickland’s words out of context. Text under the video cites a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial board’s February interview of Democratic primary Senate candidates, which is posted in its entirety on YouTube. The context tells the tale. At the 26:13 mark of the interview, primary hopeful P.G. Sittenfeld asked Strickland, "Why should Democratic voters not judge you by your record on guns?" He criticized Strickland for reversing his anti-gun control stance, a change of heart Strickland’s aides have attributed to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., that resulted in the deaths of 20 children and six adults. Strickland countered that he welcomed voters to judge him by his record, then changed the subject to the diversity of his cabinet appointees during his term as Ohio’s governor from 2007 to 2011. But the topic snapped back to guns (at the 28-minute mark) when one of the off-camera Plain Dealer interviewers asked Strickland to clarify his stance. "Has my position changed over time? It has," Strickland answered. "Can people criticize me for that? Absolutely. You’re not going to find me out there saying my records with guns is not a legitimate -- you know, it’s one of many issues that people will look at and make a decision about me and this race, and so on and so forth." From there, Strickland tried to explain his gun rights position, calling President Bill Clinton’s 1994 crime bill, which he voted against in Congress, "one of the worst pieces of legislation that’s been passed in decades." He said he dropped his NRA membership "five or six years ago," and defended a recent radio interview in which he boasted about his A+ rating from the NRA in 2010. Strickland’s monologue concluded at the 31:40 minute mark, when he said, "My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that." The next 12 minutes of discussion is fixed on the candidates’ stances on gun control. Not employment, not taxes. Steiner Public Relations in Columbus, Ohio, is fielding questions for Fighting for Ohio. Their spokesperson, Jen Detwiler, said, "We’ll let the content of the ad stand on its own." Our ruling An attack ad juxtaposes employment figures and tax dollars with a video clip of Strickland saying, "My record is mixed and spotty, and I can be criticized for that." Strickland’s stance on gun control may have wavered, but the context in which he made the "mixed and spotty" statement did not. Strickland was talking about guns, not jobs or taxes. The Fighting for Ohio PAC’s "Spotty" ad distorts the context of his statement.

pomt-07879	Says "every school will be negatively impacted" if Education Stability Fund is not tapped.	true	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/07/dave-hunt/dave-hunt-says-schools-will-suffer-without-planned/	The Oregon Legislature is up and running, which means battles over the budget -- both for the current two-year cycle and the next -- aren’t far off. In fact, they might have already started. In an end-of-year e-mail sent out in December, Dave Hunt, the leader of the House Democrats, said the Legislature was obligated to release some $35.5 million from the Education Stability Fund. Without it, he said, "every school across Oregon will be negatively impacted during this school year. The combined loss to schools across Clackamas County alone would be $3,371,694. (North Clackamas Schools would lose $1,026,281, Oregon City Schools would lose $470,150, and Gladstone Schools would lose $121,028 for this school year.)" Clackamas County is home to 10 school districts in all, according to the state. (For those wondering why he’s so concerned about Clackamas County -- he’s the representative from Gladstone.) We wondered whether this was true. To start with, we gave Hunt’s office a call. Michael Cox, the House Democrats’ spokesman, pointed us to an analysis of school funding. It spelled out two scenarios: what schools would get under the current budget and what schools would get under the current budget minus $35.5 million. It backed up Hunt’s statement exactly. Every school would see a loss of dollars. And the numbers he cited for specific schools were accurate. There were a few caveats, however. According to the fine print, the analysis: 1) "Assumes districts have same formula high cost disability grant as 09-10 preliminary" 2) "Excludes $12.5 million for formula facility grants which can vary greatly by district by year" 3) "Uses August 2010 school district data and estimates of school formula local revenue" These caveats are understandable; there’s some information the state just doesn't have at this point. But, even in the event that these assumptions are way off, they apply to such a small portion of the overall budget that the outcome of the analysis wouldn’t be affected much. When all of that checked out, we still had one nagging question: Were schools really counting on this cash? You could draw up an annual budget for PolitiFact Oregon and show our funding before and after a $35.5 million infusion (yeah, right), but if we were never expecting it in the first place, it’s not as though we’d be taking a loss. Similarly if schools were never counting on the $35.5 million -- if it was never built into their budgets -- it wouldn’t be fair to say they’d suffer without it. For that piece, we called Oregon’s Legislative Fiscal Office. There, Monica Brown told us that the current school year was operating on a $2.86 billion budget and that, yes, in fact, that number did include the $35.5 million that Hunt was all worked up about. We wondered when, exactly, that yet-to-be-released $35.5 million got folded into the budget, so we gave Cox another call. He pointed us in the direction of an Aug. 26, 2010, news release. At the time of the release, the state economist had just released a budget forecast that showed an additional $377.5 million shortfall. To help offset educational cuts that might come as a result, then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski, Senate President Peter Courtney and then-Speaker of the House Dave Hunt "agreed that in order to protect schools, approximately $34 million of the state reserve funds will be committed to K-12 when the Legislature convenes in February 2011." Well, it’s February 2011, so Hunt is reminding legislators about the deal. Of course, a few things have since changed, not the least of which is that the House is now evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. (You’ll notice that none of the parties who agreed to this move is a Republican.) This is all beside the point, but we did contact Nick Smith, the spokesman for Co-Speaker of the House Bruce Hanna, a Republican from Roseburg, to see if there was any movement to resist tapping into the Education Stability Fund. Smith couldn’t say definitively but added "we certainly have no interest in blocking whatever needs to be done to keep the budget balanced and the schools open." So, back to the statement, would every school be negatively impacted without this cash? Well, each and every school budget would take a hit. Hunt had the analysis to prove his point. We rate this claim True. Comment on this item.	None	Dave Hunt	None	None	None	2011-02-07T06:00:00	2010-12-23	['None']
pomt-08795	"Most AGs don't go to court.."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/19/holly-benson/benson-claims-mccollum-last-courtroom-70s/	The three Republican candidates for attorney general are all trying to distinguish their records based on their resumes. Holly Benson, whose last job was the head of a state agency, downplayed courtroom experience in a recent debate. After one of her opponents, former prosecutor Pam Bondi, touted her own courtroom experience, Benson tried to portray logging hours in the courtroom as something that isn't necessary for an AG. Instead, Benson highlighted her own administrative experience overseeing the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation and then the state Agency for Health Care Administration. "Yesterday I was talking to somebody from General McCollum's team who said 'I think the last time he was in court was the late '70s,' '' Benson said. "So most AGs don't go to court and it's not a primary requirement of the job." That wasn't intended as a swipe at Attorney General Bill McCollum -- a fellow Republican who is now running for governor. Instead, Benson was trying to suggest that Bondi's courtroom experience isn't essential to the AG position. But we wanted to check to see if Benson is right: do most AGs stay out of court? We delved into the backgrounds of Florida's three most recent AGs. Florida's current AG, McCollum, was elected to the job in 2006. AG spokeswoman Ryan Wiggins said McCollum hasn't been in the courtroom while AG. AG spokeswoman Sandi Copes declined to comment on whether the amount of courtroom experience matters for an AG. She said she found no information that showed that McCollum's predecessor Charlie Crist was in court either while he held that post between 2002 and 2006. But Crist's spokesman in the governor's office, Sterling Ivey, said that Crist was in the courtroom while he was AG on a telecom case. He referred us to Chris Kise, then the solicitor general. In Crist vs. Jaber, the case involved a challenge to a $350 million rate hike that the Public Service Commission had approved for Florida telecoms, Kise told us in an e-mail. The AG's office argued that the PSC did not follow the statutory mandate because the rates would not remain affordable. Crist argued the case before the Florida Supreme Court along with Deputy Solicitor General Lynn Hearn. Kise said he personally prepared Crist for the oral argument and "he actually stood up and argued part of the case." We asked Kise his thoughts on AGs and courtroom experience. He said it helps to have a "substantial legal background whether it be trial work or otherwise what I would call real lawyer background. It's an advantage because you understand more about the legal system and the challenges in representing clients. It provides a perspective. Is it essential? I guess its not essential." We also spoke to Bob Butterworth who served as AG between 1987 and 2002. He guessed that he was in the courtroom about 25 times. "Many times I sat second chair for a couple of hearings or Supreme Court arguments, but I never handled (the case) myself because it took two, three solid weeks to get prepared," Butterworth said. "It's very hard as the AG of a large state to do that. A number of AGs do it, but relatively few." Butterworth said though he never handled a jury trial as AG he did handle other matters: "I handled motions. I would also handle a number of settlements that had to be approved by the court such as (the landmark tobacco lawsuit) where Gov. Lawton Chiles and I both represented to a court why we wanted to accept a settlement." Butterworth did not see extensive courtroom experience as essential to the job. "Your job is primarily administration, basically being up front in the agency," he said. "I do not see it as a negative for any person running for the office of AG to not have argued cases." To get a nationwide perspective on how often AGs go to court we spoke with Patrick Lynch, the attorney general of Rhode Island for about eight years and a past president of the National Association of Attorneys General. As AG, Lynch also handles criminal cases but we focused our discussion on his role that relates to more typical AG work. Lynch said it's more common to see a district attorney try cases than an AG. Generally speaking, Lynch said AGs are seen in court when their office has a case before the U.S. Supreme Court or a higher court. But "in the everyday drudgery of trying cases, going in front of the bar is more rare than not. It's too time consuming. You have too many other responsibilities." Lynch said that he will sometimes make appearances in court to show support for his attorneys -- for example he was in the courtroom for arguments in a high-profile lawsuit involving companies that manufactured lead paint but did not deliver these arguments himself. But Lynch could not recall himself delivering the opening or closing arguments or making an oral argument himself in court as the AG. Since we're on the topic of experience, we asked all three Republican AG campaigns about their candidate's recent time in the courtroom. Bondi worked for the state attorney's office in Hillsborough County for 18 years until she resigned in December to run for office, said Brett Doster, a campaign spokesman. She was in the courtroom throughout her tenure, he said. "Two of her cases are on death row right now," said Doster, who said Bondi also handled "any criminal issue you can imagine." Kottkamp, elected as Gov. Crist's lieutenant governor in 2006, "did extensive trial and appeals work" before he held his current position, according to campaign spokesman David Bishop. The last case he could recall in the courtroom was in 2005. "It was while he was with the law firm Henderson, Franklin, Starnes & Holt. He represented Publix Super Markets. Case was in Florida 2nd DCA,'' Bishop wrote. And now Benson. Benson's campaign said that since she was a transactional lawyer -- a term that refers to business deals -- most of her legal experience was outside of the courtroom. She was the secretary for DBPR in 2007 and 2008 and secretary for AHCA 2008-2009. Before those administrative positions, she was a state representative between 2000 and 2007. Benson worked as a municipal bond lawyer from 1996-2007 "and while she occasionally had bond validation hearings in front of judges, she did not routinely appear in court," Bridges said in an e-mail. "The main role for AG is to actually manage and run an agency -- not to try cases on a regular basis," Bridges said in an interview. So where does that leave us? Benson said that "most AGs don't appear in court." McCollum's AG office says he hasn't appeared in court and had no record of Crist appearing in court although we were able to find an example of a case in which Crist did appear. Butterworth said he might have gone to court 25 times in 16 years -- so less than twice a year. By looking at the three most recent examples in Florida, AGs rarely go to court -- but it does happen. So we give Benson a Mostly True.	None	Holly Benson	None	None	None	2010-08-19T10:09:52	2010-07-31	['None']
pomt-01598	"Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies: corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns" and got $570 million in job-development incentives	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/03/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-walker-gave-570-m/	A TV ad by a liberal political group blames lagging job growth on Gov. Scott Walker, charging that millions in precious job-development funds went to his pals and campaign donors. The ad begins with snippets of TV news reports highlighting Wisconsin’s employment struggles compared with its neighbors, then a narrator does the rest: "What’s Scott Walker doing wrong? Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies … corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns … $570 million of our jobs money to Scott Walker’s friends. That’s how things work in Scott Walker’s Wisconsin." The ad, which began airing Aug. 20, 2014, is from the Greater Wisconsin Committee, a group funded by labor unions and Democratic ideological groups, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. Is the group right to say $570 million went to Walker "cronies?" The figure comes from a document released in May 2014 by the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now. It was entitled "W is for WEDC: Gov. Scott Walker’s privatized Commerce Department: A case study in corruption, cronyism and incompetence." Early in his term, Walker replaced the public Commerce Department with the private-public Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC). His stated rationale was to narrow the focus to job creation. In 2013, state auditors found the agency didn't adequately follow up to see if jobs were being created by companies granted incentives; didn't clearly report the jobs numbers it did have; and gave awards to ineligible businesses and projects. In the wake of that, One Wisconsin Now sought to connect Walker’s gubernatorial campaign donors to the loans, grants, bonds, tax credits or other financial assistance granted or overseen by the WEDC agency, which is chaired by Walker. The group said it found $570 million in financial incentives to 192 firms whose employees were a source of campaign donations to Walker. It said Walker received more than $1 million between 2009 and 2013 from people associated with the firms, and in some cases their spouses. (The incentives are paid in full over several years, unless goals are not met.) We ran our own checks on the $570 million figure and talked to One Wisconsin Now, the Greater Wisconsin Committee and the Walker campaign about the ad. Bottom line: There is a way to get to that number, but it’s a big stretch to characterize it as the Greater Wisconsin Committee did in its ad. Looking at the contributions There’s no doubt that people associated with companies that received WEDC help have given to Walker’s campaigns. One example: In 2011 and 2013, WEDC gave Sargento Foods access to $1.5 million in tax credits to support capital projects. From 2009 to 2013, Sargento company executives and their spouses, and other company employees, gave more than $81,000 to Walker’s campaigns. They gave nothing to Walker’s opponents in that period. All of that’s nothing new -- Walker’s Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle, received such donations, as no doubt every governor has. And it is perhaps particularly unsurprising in Walker’s case, given that the Republican’s natural base of support is business. But the TV ad plays fast and loose in describing all these donors as Walker "cronies," which it defines as "corporate friends." The use of the word "crony" itself, of course, carries a negative spin. And when the ad cites two media sources to back the language it uses, it misleads on both. The ad lists WKOW-TV in Madison as the source of the "friends" description in relation to the incentives. But the station’s online story cited in the ad just called them donors. The ad cites Isthmus, Madison’s free weekly newspaper, for the "cronies" term. The publication did use the phrase, but in a story from July 18, 2013 -- a year before the $570 million number came out. Equal opportunity givers More significantly, the research that underlies the $570 million figure counts numerous companies whose employees have also given to Democrats. Indeed, major candidates from both parties typically receive backing from business -- money flows to the party in power, and its allies. The Greater Wisconsin Committee itself has received money from groups supported by wealthy business interests, according to data from the Democracy Campaign. Our examination found that 35 companies that received more than $295 million in help from Walker’s WEDC have in the past supported Doyle through employee donations. That includes givers at major firms such as Menards, Ashley Furniture and Kohl’s. If you knock out just those Doyle-connected firms, the $570 million is already down to about $275 million. Similar connections can be found for contributions to Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett (who faced Walker in 2010 and in the 2012 recall) and other Democrats, including to a much lesser extent Walker’s 2014 opponent Mary Burke. Even more revealing is the case of biotech firm Promega Corp. of Fitchburg, which got $75 million in bonding authority overseen by WEDC. That put it on the ad's "crony" list. But the firm’s founder, William Linton, has given nothing to Walker. In contrast, he gave $6,000 to Doyle, $17,500 to Barrett for his two campaigns against Walker and $1,000 to Burke, late last year. Promega employees have given overwhelmingly to Democrats and liberals for years, to the tune of more than $30,000. Just two employees gave a total of $600 to Walker, based on our check of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign’s searchable campaign finance database. Yet the company makes the list. More issues To be sure, donations from workers at some firms have been sizeable. Donations totalled $5,000 or more to Walker from employees at 45 firms that won $172 million in assistance. But the analysis used in the ad didn’t distinguish between CEOs making maximum donations and rank-and-file workers whose small donations may have had nothing to do with any desire of the company to stay in Walker’s good graces. Nor did it matter if donors gave right around the time of getting an award, or made a small gift three years earlier. Eleven firms that received $14 million in help were counted even though their employees gave $100 or less in total. Was Walker rewarding "friends" when WEDC awarded retail giant Amazon $7 million in tax credits in October 2013? An Amazon software engineer in Ohio did give Walker’s campaign a total of $160 that year in two donations, the only ones identified as from Amazon employees to Walker. That alone put Amazon on the list. A contribution that size is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Walker’s $56 million, 50-state fundraising take since mid-2009. We tried an exercise, selecting $1,000 in donations as a minimum "crony" threshold -- surely your close friends at one firm would give that much over 5 years. Companies whose owners and employees cumulatively gave less than $1,000 -- and didn’t give to Doyle -- account for $160 million in aid out of the $570 million. If you take out that $160 million, the bottom line falls to around $115 million. 275 from above - 160 Plus, we found that $7.5 million in deals were wrongly attributed to the Walker era when they were made under Doyle. One last note: More than $295 million of the $570 million in WEDC aid cited by the ad came from flood-relief loans for developers as part of the federal flood-relief program known as Midwest Disaster Area Bonds. The Walker campaign protests that it’s misleading to include those in the WEDC aid total because local communities, not WEDC, issue the bond funds. Still, the agency assists developers in some cases, allocates bonding authority and reviews the deals, even bragging that the program helps toward Walker’s goal of 250,000 new private-sector jobs. Our rating The liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee PAC claimed that "Scott Walker gave Wisconsin job creation money to his cronies: corporate friends who contributed to his campaigns" and got $570 million in incentives. The list of companies that won $570 million and gave to Walker is a starting point for trying to spot instances in which a true Walker crony got a sweet deal. But that’s all it is. Much of that money went to firms whose employees have given to Democrats in the past. Many of the donations were small, and Walker’s jobs agency has a limited role in dealing with firms associated with a big chunk of the $570 million. The ad makes a red-hot charge that suggests corruption, even putting a dollar figure on it, but can’t deliver the goods. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12577	"Data shows that vehicle break-in is the No. 1 crime in the city, but also the No. 1 crime in the South Side Flats, and it’s closely followed by assault."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/apr/11/bruce-kraus/vehicle-break-most-common-crime-pittsburgh/	Parking is a contentious issue in the nightlife hotspot South Side Flats — and according to Pittsburgh City Council President Bruce Kraus, it’s also the source of the city’s most common crime. As part of an effort to ease parking woes for residents and improve public safety, the city launched shuttle service Nite Rider on March 17. The fare-free shuttle runs Friday and Saturday evenings, allowing Pittsburghers to leave their cars at the Second Avenue Parking Plaza to go to the nightlife on East Carson Street and the surrounding South Side Flats. It’s part of a "public safety strategy designed as a transportation strategy," Kraus told The Incline, adding that vehicle break-ins are the most frequent crime in the South Side Flats — and overall in the city. Within the Flats, assault is the No. 2 crime (if simple and aggravated assaults are combined), Kraus said. "Data shows that vehicle break-in is the No. 1 crime in the city, but also the No. 1 crime in the South Side Flats, and it’s closely followed by assault. So it’s always been my dream that if we take cars out of residential areas, put them in a single, secure lighted location, they’re easier to patrol, there’s less chance of miscreant behavior, and I’m hoping at the end of the year to show a drastic reduction in vehicle break-ins," Kraus said. While the Nite Ride and other changes, including extended parking meter hours, are designed to make it easier and more inviting to go to the South Side business district, we wondered, are vehicle break-ins really the top crime in the South Side Flats? And in the city? Kraus told The Incline that he based his statement on conversations with Zone 3 Pittsburgh Police Commander Karen Dixon, and the data they discussed is reflected in the police bureau’s Annual Report. The most current version of that report available is from 2015. In it, police breakdown reported crimes into 24 categories, plus an "other" section. Of the 24 specific crimes, theft was No. 1 in 2015 with 7,101 reported incidents out of the year’s total of 30,900 reports. Those numbers are tabulated based on reports to police. But theft is a broad category that includes more than just vehicle break-ins. In 2015, there were 2,311 reports of vehicle break-ins or "theft from auto," as police call it, per Emily Schaffer, spokeswoman for the public safety department. When theft is split into those two categories — theft from auto and other theft — that puts theft from auto as the fourth most common crime in 2015, behind simple assault at No. 1 (5,446), followed by other theft (4,790) and vandalism (3,507). In the report’s neighborhood breakdown, theft was also No. 1 for 2015 at 505. Of those, 190 were "theft from auto" per Schaffer. Using the same list of 24 specific crimes for 2015, after theft is public drunkenness in second with 323 incidents, and in third, 310 simple assault incidents. However, combining simple assault with the 61 aggravated assaults brings it to No. 2, as Kraus said, with a total of 371 assaults. But, split theft from auto and other theft, and vehicle break-ins come in at No. 5. First is 323 incidents of public drunkenness, second is 315 reported thefts, third is 310 reports of simple assault and fourth is 211 reports of vandalism. If aggravated and simple assaults are combined, it becomes the most common crime in the South Side Flats in 2015, followed by public drunkenness, other theft, vandalism and theft from auto. Our ruling When theft is split into "theft from auto" and "other theft," vehicle break-ins fall to the fourth most common crime across the city and No. 5 in the South Side Flats. That split also makes simple and aggravated assaults the most common crime in the neighborhood for 2015. The councilmember would have been on firm ground if he had said theft — the category vehicle break-ins falls into — was the most common crime in the city and South Side Flats. When looking at the overall theft category and combining the two assault categories, theft does become the most common crime, and Kraus also would be correct that the second most common crime in the Flats is assault. We rule the claim False.	None	Bruce Kraus	None	None	None	2017-04-11T13:17:54	2017-03-22	['None']
pomt-09185	"The Democratic Congress has already taken significant steps to create jobs and jump-start the economy, resulting in the lowest tax rates in over 50 years and the creation of over 500,000 new jobs so far this year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/02/mark-critz/critz-touts-democratic-role-low-taxes-job-creation/	On May 27, 2010 -- less than 10 days after winning a House seat in a special election -- Rep. Mark Critz, D-Pa., took to the House floor to tout what his fellow Democrats have been doing to improve the nation's dismal economy. "The Democratic Congress has already taken significant steps to create jobs and jump-start the economy, resulting in the lowest tax rates in over 50 years and the creation of over 500,000 new jobs so far this year," Critz said. We'll analyze his points one by one. • Are tax rates the lowest in over 50 years? It depends on the definition of the phrase "tax rate" -- whether you literally mean the rate, or whether you look at how the tax burden falls on the average American. If you only look at the rate for the federal income tax, the lowest bracket -- currently applying to families earning up to $16,750 -- has been 10 percent since 2002. That's the lowest it has been in the past 50 years, with the exception of the period 1977 to 1986, when it was zero (but when there was no standard deduction, as there is today). If you look at the top tax bracket, the rates today are also low, though -- as is the case with the lowest bracket -- not the lowest in 50 years. Since 2003, the top rate, which is currently levied on families earning above $373,650, has been 35 percent. The only period when it was lower was between 1988 and 1992, when the top rate ranged from 31 to 33 percent. (And it's been far higher: As late as 1963, the top rate was 91 percent.) Of course, Americans also pay state and local taxes. The rates vary widely by state, but the most recent available national average, for 2008, is 9.7 percent. That's well within the historical range: Since 1977, the national average has remained within a narrow band of 9.3 percent to 10.3 percent. So tax rates today are fairly low, but not at absolute record lows for the past 50 years. What about tax burden? Although he didn't use that word, when people talk about rates, they often mean the overall burden. The most complete accounting we've seen is a table of tax data assembled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that measures the average federal income tax rate -- that is, federal income taxes paid divided by income -- for four-person families at three representative levels of income. The data covers the years 1955 to 2009: At half the median national income and at the median income, the rates for 2008 and 2009 are the lowest on record, and at twice the median income, it is lower than every year since 1967 except for one (2003). In fact, a family at half the median income (which calculates to roughly $38,000) actually got 8.33 percent of their income back from the government in 2008 and 8.28 percent back in 2009. (That's due to refundable credits, mainly the Earned Income Tax Credit.) The rate for median families ($76,000 last year) paid just 3.54 percent of their income in taxes in 2008 and 4.63 percent in 2009, while families at twice the median income (nearly $152,000) paid 12.35 percent of their income in taxes in 2008 and 12.58 percent in 2009. Other measures confirm the general trendline. The Tax Foundation, an independent tax-research group in Washington, has found that the average taxpayer's combined tax burden accounted for 26.6 percent of income in 2009 and 26.9 percent in 2010, the lowest since 1965. And according to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, total federal tax receipts were 14.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, the lowest percentage since 1950. So Critz is on safe ground when he says that the rate of taxes paid to income earned is at low levels compared to the past 50 years. He probably should have used the phrase "tax burden" rather than "tax rate," but the terminology he used isn't incorrect. So for this portion of his statement, we rate him Mostly True. • Have 500,000 new jobs been created so far this year? Politicians love to talk about "jobs created," but in reality, there's no statistic that specifically calculates the numbers of jobs created. Instead, this number usually refers to the net increase in jobs from one time period to another. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the net monthly increases were 14,000 jobs for January, 39,000 for February, 230,000 for March, and 290,000 for April. If you add these up, they total 573,000 jobs, making Critz's statement correct. We'll note that the March and April figures are preliminary. But given what we know now, we rate this part of Critz's statement True. • Does the Democratic Congress deserve credit for the low tax rates and the jobs created? Let's take jobs first. To the extent that any political entity deserves credit for the job growth, the Democratic Congress would qualify. Along with President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat, they have exercised unified control of the government since January 2009. But it's a huge stretch to say all the job gains are the work of the Democratic-run government. There is considerable debate among economists about how much the Democratic stimulus bill truly helped the economy. And given the many factors that help shape the national and international economy, many observers have argued that the president and Congress usually get too much credit during good times and too much blame during bad times. On taxes, it's also complicated. The Democrats can rightly take credit for the inclusion of tax cuts in Obama's economic stimulus bill since only three Congressional Republicans voted for it. The administration says that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided $288 billion in tax relief, of which roughly $163 billion has been paid out so far. And stimulus money helped many states stave off tax increases that they might otherwise have been forced to impose had there been no stimulus. But economists we interviewed emphasized that two other major factors have also played a role in keeping taxes low -- and Congressional Democrats can hardly claim credit for these. The first is the Republican-driven tax-cutting measures passed in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush. They were largely opposed by Democrats, but established today's relatively low federal income tax rates. The second factor is the recession. By nature, all recessions depress taxation rates, as individuals and families shift to lower tax brackets and, as a result, pay out less of their income in taxes. The Bush tax cuts and the recession are "hardly facets of the issue that a newly minted Democrat should be touting," said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Overall, then, Critz was mostly right on the stats -- that taxes are relatively low right now, and that 500,000 jobs have been created this year. But it's a stretch for him to suggest that the Democrats deserve any more than partial credit for the shape of today's tax landscape. So we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-08591	A bill by Earl Blumenauer would "mandate GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/delia-lopez/delia-lopez-says-earl-blumenauer-trying-track-amer/	Rep. Earl Blumenauer wants to know where you are and where you’re going. At least that’s what his Republican challenger has been telling voters these days on her website and in talk radio appearances. According to Republican congressional hopeful Delia Lopez, Blumenauer sponsored a bill that would put "GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles." Here’s her grievance in detail:: "Earl Blumenauer is the sponsor of HR-3311 to mandate GPS tracking devices on all our vehicles. To track our every mile and know everywhere we go. The pilot program will waste hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when we are already deep in debt and spending too much. ... This bill is designed to transition us to a per mile vehicle tax system called The Road User Fee Pilot Project and would be administered by the Treasury Department otherwise know as the IRS. This system will track all American cars using a new form of taxation. Cars will be taxed by the mileage they drive. Under the bill the IRS or Treasury will appropriate $154,000,000 of taxpayers money in the form of free grants to well connected commercial manufactures. It means that every car in America will be tracked through whatever method they choose. This constitutes absolute surveillance whether on public or private property, welcome to another attack on the 4th amendment." Sounds more than a little Orwellian, right? The government, with one little-noticed bill, is going to start tracking your every vehicular movement. Or is it? PolitiFact Oregon decided to dig into this claim, which has been making the rounds on conservative websites even outside the state. First, let’s start with the basics: It’s true that Blumenauer is the sponsor of H.R. 3311, and it’s also true that the bill, if passed, would cost the government a little over $154 million. But beyond that, Lopez’s argument doesn’t track. A reading of the actual bill shows that, rather than install GPS tracking devices into all cars nationwide, Blumenauer is looking to set up a national pilot program that would test alternative ways of taxing road use. This shouldn’t be too new to Oregonians. For more than a decade, state policy makers have been trying to figure out how to pay for road maintenance once gas taxes drop because hybrids and electric cars rule the roads. It’s true, GPS could be used in one or more the programs that might spring up if this bill becomes law. In Oregon’s own statewide pilot program, the Department of Transportation used GPS as its main method of tracking mileage. But, as Blumenauer spokesman Willie Smith points out, GPS is just one way to go about this, and, in fact, there’s no stipulation in the bill that GPS (which isn’t even mentioned in the legislation) be a part of the trial program. "There’s a number of methods for this," Smith said. "Our bill doesn’t prescribe one way or another." PolitiFact Oregon reads the bill the same way. Moreover, it should be noted that the bill includes a provision that all pilot programs be evaluated on the basis of a few criteria, including "protection of personal privacy." Candidate Lopez, however, remains unconvinced. "I think it’s quite plain that the idea in there is to put the GPS tracking in all of our vehicles," she said. "It may be squirmy verbiage that’s put in there. They don’t want to admit that this is exactly what they want to do." Squirmy verbiage or not, a $154 million pilot program with no specific mandates for GPS and a clause that keeps an eye out for personal privacy is miles away from Lopez’s description of a bill that would mandate tracking devices in "all our vehicles." Lopez is significantly distorting what Blumenauer's bill would do and ignoring the fact that GPS isn't even mentioned in it. With all that in mind, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-13532	Says U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin voted to "force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/30/end-citizens-united/pac-ad-say-bruce-poliquin-voted-force-seniors-pay-/	The political action committee End Citizens United has launched a multi-pronged attack ad against Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, accusing the businessman of making health care more costly for older Americans. In a 30-second television commercial, the PAC says Poliquin voted for a Medicare proposal that would "force seniors to pay thousands more." "He’d even force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs," the ad says. Poliquin's office objected to the ad, saying in a news release, "Congressman Poliquin has been working to get prescription drug prices down, not up. That’s why he strongly supported Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for our seniors." Who's right here? Both sides are spinning the truth. End Citizens United spokesman Adam Bozzi says the claim is a reference to Poliquin's March 25, 2015, vote for a Republican budget that called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The measure passed the House, but it had no shot of passing the Senate and surviving the veto of President Barack Obama Obama. The language of the ad itself if difficult to understand. We watched the ad several times and weren’t entirely sure if the ad said, "He’d even force seniors to pay …" or "He even forced seniors to pay …" The wording difference might mislead voters as to what Poliquin did or hoped to do. Either way, End Citizens United says a vote to repeal Obamacare is a vote to force seniors to pay more for drugs because repealing Obamacare would eliminate a fix to Medicare Part D known as the prescription drug doughnut hole. Here's what they’re talking about. In 2010, seniors had to pay full price for the first $310 worth of prescription drugs purchased. Between $310 and $2,830, insurance kicked in and Medicare paid 75 percent of the cost. But once the bill exceeded $2,830, seniors had to pay the full price of their drugs until the annual bill reached $4,550 (the doughnut hole). Then catastrophic insurance kicked in and insurance covered 95 percent of the cost. So the "hole" was the $1,720 gap between $2,830 and $4,550. In 2006, 4 million seniors ended up paying full price for some of their prescriptions because of the gap. The health care law, passed in 2010, sought to shrink and eliminate that gap in coverage. The gap is in the process of being phased out and will close completely in 2020. But even closing it gradually, combined with other features of Obamacare saved nearly 10.7 million seniors more than $20 billion on drug costs, according to a February 2016 estimate by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That's nearly $2,000 per senior since the law was enacted. Repealing Obamacare would cost seniors in other ways, as we outlined two years ago. Poliquin’s campaign argued that Poliquin actually voted against an attempt to repeal Obamacare in February 2015, because there was no plan to replace it. He voted for repeal the following month because the Republican budget had a better plan that would have kept traditional Medicare "as a plan option" for people in or near retirement but privatized part of the program. There was another vote on repealing Obamacare on Jan. 6, 2016. Poliquin voted in favor of it. His spokesman, Michael Byerly, said that wasn't really a vote to repeal "as it technically only repealed the harmful taxes and provisions that have caused prices to go up." But sponsor Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, opened debate on the measure by saying, "For the first time since the law was enacted, Congress is one vote away from sending a broad repeal of Obamacare to the president’s desk." Byerly, Poliquin's spokesman, also argued that prescription drug prices have gone up because of Obamacare itself, referring us to a 2010 letter from the Congressional Budget Office predicting a 1 percent increase for established drugs. Democrats, in turn, have argued that Obamacare has kept health costs lower than they would have been without the legislation. As we've reported in the past, such arguments are debatable. To sum it up, Poliquin never voted to raise drug prices directly. He voted to repeal the health care law -- a show vote that could have resulted in drug prices going up for Medicare recipients. Our ruling End Citizens United's ad says Poliquin voted to "force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs." It gives the misleading impression that he voted on that specific issue when, in fact, he was voting to repeal the 2010 health care law. If the repeal bill had become law — it didn’t — it would have removed provisions phasing out a prescription drug doughnut hole for Medicare recipients. End Citizens United’s claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

pomt-06057	Barack Obama’s recess appointment of Richard Cordray "is precisely what then-Sen. Obama claimed would be ‘the wrong thing to do.’"	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-once-criticized-appointment/	With the presidential race intensifying, Richard Cordray is about to become a household name -- Republican shorthand for the recess appointment heard ‘round the political world. Last week, President Barack Obama bypassed a Senate roadblock to install the former Ohio attorney general as the nation’s top consumer-finance watchdog. The decision, which Obama announced in a visit to Shaker Heights High School, brought immediate scorn from the GOP. Mindful of the election-year climate, PolitiFact Ohio was eager for reaction from Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and favorite for the Republican presidential nomination. Romney, in a pejorative nod to Obama’s hometown, delivered as might be expected. "This action represents Chicago-style politics at its worst and is precisely what then-Sen. Obama claimed would be ‘the wrong thing to do,’ " Romney said in an emailed statement. PolitiFact Ohio will leave alone the "Chicago-style politics" remark. But because Republicans are likely to repeat variations of this argument in the coming months, we decided to dig deeper to learn whether the president had indeed departed from an earlier stance on recess appointments. So first we checked in with the Romney campaign to ask for citations. Spokesman Ryan Williams quickly referred us to two Obama quotes from 2005. That was the year then-President George W. Bush bypassed Congress to install John Bolton as United Nations ambassador. And as the quotes Ryan offered show, then-Sen. Obama was not at all happy about it. On July 30, 2005, the Associated Press reported that Obama said a recess appointment would be "the wrong thing to do." Bolton, Obama added, "is the wrong person for the job." The other article the Romney campaign cited appeared a few days later in the State Journal-Register of Springfield, Ill. Here’s how Williams presented Obama’s quote about Bolton to PolitiFact Ohio: "To some degree, he’s damaged goods … somebody who couldn’t get through a nomination in the Senate. And I think that means we will have less credibility …" But when we tracked down the original quotes, we found Williams left out key context. In the AP story, Obama followed up his "wrong thing to do" comment by acknowledging that Bush "is entitled to take that action, but I don't think it will serve American foreign policy well." And here is Obama’s full quote from the State Journal-Register: "To some degree, he’s damaged goods. Not in the history of the United Nations representatives have we ever had a recess appointment, somebody who couldn’t get through a nomination in the Senate. And I think that means we will have less credibility and ironically be less equipped to reform the United Nations in the way that it needs to be reformed." In their entirety, these quotes suggest Obama’s reservations were less about the process and more about the appointee. Obama clearly recognized Bush’s right to make the recess appointment. But Obama and other Senate Democrats had opposed Bolton’s appointment primarily because he was a known critic of the U.N. They argued that Bolton’s record made him a bad fit for the job, a point that would be underscored by Bush’s recess appointment. This is not the first time an Obama recess appointment has been compared with the Bolton pick. In early 2010, the president took flak for appointing Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board. Republicans feared Becker, a lawyer who had worked for the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO, would favor unions in labor-management disputes. At the time, PolitiFact noted that during the Bolton controversy, Democrats accused him of submitting inaccurate information to the Senate. PolitiFact also considered a letter that Obama and 35 other Senate Democrats sent to Bush in protest of the Bolton appointment. They asked that Bush "submit a new nomination," rather than send an unconfirmed ambassador to the U.N. PolitiFact found Obama’s recess appointment of Becker to be a "Half Flip," noting that the GOP objected to Becker, as the Democrats objected to Bolton, on "policy grounds" and merits. "If every appointee for whom Obama made a recess appointment was noncontroversial, Obama would have a good argument that the two situations were different," PolitiFact ruled. Cordray, conversely, was not himself controversial. Republicans who blocked his appointment expressed little if any concern about his temperament or views. Many had kind words for him. Their beef was with the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau he now leads. Jay Carney, Obama’s press secretary, explained the differences thusly in a Jan. 5 briefing: "There is no question about [Cordray’s] qualifications for this job. In the case of Mr. Bolton there were a great many questions about his qualifications for the job and a great deal of opposition to his nomination on the merits, on his qualifications, and that makes this quite different." After reviewing the Bolton appointment and the full statements on which Romney bases his claim, we’re not sure the Cordray situation is, as Carney contends, "quite different." Nor is it, as Romney asserts, "precisely" what Obama once said was "the wrong thing to do." Romney’s claim is partially accurate. In both cases you have a president ignoring the protests of the opposing party in Congress. And Obama did criticize the Bolton appointment. But in Bolton’s case you have Democrats scrutinizing the appointee himself and then-Sen. Obama questioning whether Bolton can effectively work with an institution he has criticized. In Cordray’s case, you have Republicans blocking an appointee because they are unhappy with the agency. Romney used the word "precisely" to draw a comparison that was not nearly as black and white as he implied. And the versions of the quotes that his staff cited in support of his claim were abridged, leaving out important details that would help the listener put Obama’s statements in context. As such, on the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Romney’s claim Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-11T06:00:00	2012-01-04	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-06159	Says Newt Gingrich "made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who were in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-newt-gingrich-promised-sup/	Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann says that, as president, she will be "100 percent pro-life from conception until natural death." And she says the same can’t be said of her opponents. In a Republican presidential primary debate in Sioux City, Iowa, on Dec. 15, 2011, Bachmann attacked front-runner Newt Gingrich, the former U.S. House speaker, for his past actions on abortion. She said he passed on a chance to defund Planned Parenthood, then lobbed this bombshell: "And also I think even more troubling, when he was in Washington, D.C., he made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who are in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion," Bachmann said. Did we hear that right? The man who led the Republican takeover of Congress and authored the conservative Contract with America said he’d campaign for late-term abortion proponents? This called for a fact check. The background In 1998, when Gingrich was speaker, a feud erupted within the Republican National Committee over a proposal to cut off funding for any Republican candidate who refused to support a ban on partial-birth abortion, a procedure involving the extraction of a late-term fetus. Republicans in Congress had failed to get a ban enacted -- President Bill Clinton had vetoed two measures. So GOP leaders sought to ensure that any Republican who got elected would support the ban. But many in the party -- Gingrich among them -- objected to the funding cut, saying the approach would "set an unhealthy precedent -- the party hierarchy trying to dictate to rank and file voters whom they should elect and why," according to the Boston Globe. Gingrich spoke at a luncheon during the RNC’s winter meeting in California on Jan. 16, 1998. Here are excerpts of his remarks on the subject: "Let me make very clear I have voted to ban partial births. I have consistently sided with Henry Hyde and Chris Smith on issues that are matters of right to life. I believe deeply and passionately in the right to life, and I think those of us who believe that have an obligation to do all we can. "I am also the Republican speaker of the House, and I can tell you that Henry Hyde would not be chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Orrin Hatch would not be chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee if the Republican Party decides that we are no longer a broad party that invites people who broadly share our views, but we are going to start going down a road where we start limiting who people get to pick in primaries. After all, it is the voters of America who choose who the nominees are. It is the voters of America who have a right -- some places they are going to pick people who are to my right; some places they are going to pick people who are to my left. "And in both cases, if they are the Republican nominee, I am going to actively campaign for them, because when they get to Congress, whether they are a moderate Republican from the Northeast, whether they are a very conservative Republican from the South or West -- whatever their background, I am going to turn to them and say, ‘This is the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee -- of course you are going to vote to make him chairman.’" He called the funding ban a "tactical mistake" because it pulled focus from Clinton’s vetoes. "The country doesn't think it makes any sense to have children killed in the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth months, particularly killed in this horrible, barbaric procedure. That's where the attention was focused, on the president's veto. And we should go back," Gingrich said. The funding ban failed on a voice vote in the RNC. A substitute amendment, saying that the party "reaffirms its principled opposition to partial-birth abortions and commits to banning this heinous procedure from America forever," passed instead. When we contacted the Bachmann campaign, a spokeswoman sent us a press release that included this quote from an Associated Press story dated a week after the RNC meeting. "Gingrich said he opposes the ‘barbaric’ abortion procedure, and would continue to vote to ban it. But he argued that the resolution was the wrong way to eliminate partial-birth abortions. ‘We don’t want to say to that the Republican National Committee is going to say to the primary voters of Charlotte, the primary voters of Greensboro, the primary voters of Columbia, S.C., if you pick the wrong person, we’re not going to support you,’ Gingrich said. ‘I think there’s a certain arrogance in saying (RNC members) nationally are now going to dictate in the primaries in every part of the country,’ he said." Our ruling Bachmann said of Gingrich, "When he was in Washington, D.C., he made an affirmative statement that he would not only support but he would campaign for Republicans who were in support of the barbaric procedure known as partial-birth abortion." She correctly stated what Gingrich told the RNC in 1998. She even used his exact words to describe partial-birth abortion, calling it a "barbaric procedure." Gingrich said he was being a pragmatist in order to maintain a majority in Congress so that it could successfully ban the procedure. He said he’d campaign for all Republicans, even those to the left of him, because he didn’t think party leaders should be "purging" Republican candidates and dictating to voters whom they should choose. Bachmann left out that context and thus, gave an incomplete impression of Gingrich’s position. Given all that, we rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-01982	"Only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/16/bill-cassidy/bill-cassidy-said-senate-democrats-only-moved-fund/	As details of the turmoil within the Department of Veterans Affairs continue to unfold, Congress is scrambling to pass legislation to fix to the problem. One House Republican accused Democrats of closing the barn door after the horse got out. "It’s been more than 177 days since the House passed bipartisan legislation that would authorize these VA clinics," Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said in a statement on June 5, 2014. "Only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action. We need to continue working towards patient-centered solutions so all veterans have access to quality healthcare." Is it true that Senate Democrats only moved to fund new veterans health clinics after the scandal broke in April? In a word: No. The bill Cassidy references is H.R. 3251, the Department of Veterans Affairs Major Medical Facility Lease Authorization Act of 2013. The bill, authored by Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., authorized the funding of 27 new Veterans Affairs health facilities around the country. On Dec. 10, 2013, the House passed the bill almost unanimously with a vote of 346 to 1. (Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., was the lone "no" vote.) The bill stalled in the Senate. In fact, it never made it out of the Veterans' Affairs committee. But as is so often the case, the Senate was working on its own bill, and that one failed because Senate Republicans objected to it. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced S. 1950, the Comprehensive Veterans Health and Benefits and Military Retirement Pay Restoration Act of 2014, on Jan. 16. (It would later be renumbered S. 1982). The scope of the bill was much broader than just funding 27 new VA health clinics. For example, it also included an expansion of physical and mental health benefits for some veterans and their families. Whereas Miller’s bill was nine pages, Sanders’ was 367 pages. Republicans objected to several components of Sanders’ bill, including its funding mechanism. Sanders would pay for his bill with money that would have gone toward the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Republicans said those savings were already expected, so it wasn’t a real source of money. (For what it’s worth, the House bill did not really specify where its funding would be taken from.) Republicans also hinged support for the bill on the inclusion of sanctions against Iran. Democrats tried to bring Sanders’ bill up for a vote on Feb. 27. Republicans made a parliamentary maneuver that imposed a 60-vote threshold to bring it to the floor. With just 56 Senators voting "yea" — including two Republicans — the bill failed to advance. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Veterans' Affairs committee, said he was concerned about the costs and the expansion of the VA when there were already considerable problems with wait times. In a press release, the American Legion lamented the bill’s failure. "There was a right way to vote and a wrong way to vote today, and 41 senators chose the wrong way," American Legion National Commander Daniel Dellinger said. "That’s inexcusable." That said, there wasn’t unanimous backing of the bill by veterans groups. In an op-ed, Stew­art Hickey, national exec­u­tive direc­tor for American Veterans, or AMVETS, said Sanders’ "kitchen sink-like" bill "would be morally irre­spon­si­ble and fis­cally unsound." For the next couple months, Sen. David Vitter, R-La., and Sanders went back and forth on the status of the veterans bill. On March 11, Vitter offered an amendment to to the House bill that would pay for the new VA clinics through price controls for prescription drugs purchased by the Defense Department. Sanders said he supported the new clinics, but also wanted other provisions included in the comprehensive legislation. On April 9, Miller, the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, announced that dozens of Arizona veterans died waiting for care from the VA, and he had evidence showing that administrators at the Phoenix office were forging wait times. There were multiple points along the way when Sam Foote, a doctor of internal medicine at the Phoenix VA before he retired, attempted to blow the whistle on the bad practices in Arizona, including a December meeting with the Arizona Republic and a letter to the VA inspector general. But it wasn’t until Miller’s comments that the story broke and became a national scandal, eventually leading to the resignation of Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. Also on April 9, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. — who Cassidy is challenging for Senate in November — actually called for the House Republican bill to be discharged from the Senate Veteran Affairs committee. But that effort was blocked by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who asked for Vitter’s amendment to be included. Sanders objected. "Both parties had a role in this," said Joe Davis, spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars. A spokeswoman for Cassidy said the congressman was only referring to Senate inaction on the House measure in his statement. However, that isn’t how his statement reads. If that were the case, it would mean that Senate Democrats had decided to take up the House bill after the scandal hit, which isn’t true. Our ruling Cassidy said that "only after news broke that our veterans are dying because of inadequate health care did Harry Reid and Senate Democrats take action." That’s not accurate. Democrats tried to pass an expansive veterans’ bill that included funding for the same 27 new clinics that Cassidy and the House passed last December. The bill was blocked by Senate Republicans, who were concerned about its funding and its scope. They also wanted to include sanctions against Iran. It’s fine for Cassidy to say Democrats bear some responsibility for not taking up the simpler House legislation, but it’s incorrect for him to claim that it took the scandal to propel Democrats into efforts to pass a VA bill. That’s revisionist history, so we rate Cassidy’s statement False.	None	Bill Cassidy	None	None	None	2014-06-16T14:10:17	2014-06-05	['Harry_Reid', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-13634	"U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!"	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2016/aug/10/allen-buckley/libertarian-buckley-target-about-gops-isakson-and-/	Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley knows he faces an uphill battle in his campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Libertarians usually pull only low single-digits of the overall Georgia voter turnout. And Isakson is a veteran lawmaker and a founding member of the state Republican establishment, which today holds sway over all statewide offices. Buckley ran unsuccessful campaigns for U.S. Senate in 2004 and 2008. But in 2008, he won enough votes in the general election to force a runoff between Republican Saxby Chambliss and Democrat Jim Martin. An Atlanta tax attorney, Buckley thinks he has an issue that will resonate with voters if he can only get them to pay attention and understand the gravitas of the soaring federal debt. "U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!" Buckley states on his website as part of a graphic about Isakson votes to raise the federal debt limit. Is that possible? Has Isakson, who has pushed for a balanced budget amendment and who also blasts the federal debt on his campaign website, actually assisted the spending spree? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Buckley and Democrat Jim Barksdale will face Isakson in the November election. We first contacted Buckley, who said the graphic refers to Isakson’s repeated votes to raise the federal debt limit, which essentially means raising the cap on what the government is permitted to spend to pay the bills. "I believe Mr. Isakson has, irresponsibly and immorally, voted to grow the federal government through debt spending to the detriment of young people and our country." Buckley said in an email. He later added: "He largely created the mess and then voted to fund what he created." Buckley said Isakson voted for debt-bloating items like the war in Iraq and the Medicare prescription drug benefit and subsequently voted for debt-ceiling increases to cover the cost of the increased spending. Isakson’s campaign manager, Trey Kilpatrick, dismissed Buckley assertions, but did not dispute Isakson’s vote to raise the debt limit. "Mr. Buckley is trying to mislead voters by citing debt ceiling votes (required for solvency) without citing Johnny's votes against trillions of dollars in unnecessary spending, including voting against a minimum of $5 trillion in debt ceiling votes alone, or his vote for the Budget Control Act, which cut spending by over $2 trillion and, according to the Heritage Foundation, 'has shrunk the size of government more effectively than any budget tool in a generation," Kilpatrick wrote in an email. The debate over the federal debt comes at an interesting time. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this month released a report that warned of vastly increased federal debt when compared to the Gross Domestic Product over the next three decades. Federal debt held by the public was 39 percent of GDP in 2008, but is now about 75 percent, the budget office said. That could rise to 86 percent by 2026 and a whopping 141 percent by 2046. "The prospect of such large debt poses substantial risks for the nation and presents policymakers with significant challenges," the budget office warned. The CBO said the government’s spending growth is outpacing revenues as spending soars for popular programs like Social Security and Medicare and interest on the government’s existing debt. The most popular programs cost a lot to maintain, and neither Democrats nor Republicans want to be blamed for cuts, experts told PolitiFact. PolitiFact consulted political and budget experts across the county. Their verdict: Buckley has a point about Isakson’s spending votes, but there is a lot of context missing. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said many of the most popular federal programs are also the most expensive. That puts politicians of all stripes in a difficult spot. "Some, like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Defense spending, interest on the debt etc. are bigger than others," Sabato said. "Given that many of these categories are mandatory, it’s hard to imagine that any member of Congress hasn’t cast votes that effectively increase the amount of debt the country incurs." Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute, said that by voting for debt-limit increases members of Congress have "kicked the can down the road" on the government’s debt problem. "Voting for annual deficit-financed budgets causes the accumulated debt to rise, but voting to increase the legal debt limit—as Isakson and others do regularly—ratifies the unsound practice of endlessly spending more than is taken in," Edwards wrote in an email. Kennesaw State University political scientist Kerwin Swint said voting to raise the debt ceiling is not quite the same thing as voting to create new programs or authorize new spending items "The alternative to not raising the debt ceiling is shutting down the government," Swint said. Buckley’s claim is "technically accurate of course but totally misleading," saidAlan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. Abramowitz said the U.S. should take advantage of extremely low interest rates to borrow more money to invest in much needed infrastructure improvements and other projects. "It cannot be emphasized enough that the debt obsession of some conservative politicians and pundits is totally misplaced at a time when the investing community is practically begging to purchase U.S. treasury notes at extremely low interest rates," Abramowitz said. Our ruling: Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley proclaimed on his campaign website: "U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!" Isakson did indeed vote to raise the debt ceiling, so Buckley has a valid point. But the alternative would be risking a government shutdown. That said, Buckley also pointed at that Isakson voted for some of the very programs that bloated the debt in the first place. We rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/678c89f4-52af-4e46-a0c6-780d26e73caf	None	Allen Buckley	None	None	None	2016-08-10T06:00:00	2016-07-13	['United_States']
pomt-01433	Says Rick Scott signed "laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/07/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-rick-scott-signed-laws-ultrasounds-a/	In his quest for the women’s vote. Democrat Charlie Crist continues to attack Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s record on abortion. "After it happened, Rick Scott threw a party back at the mansion. What was he celebrating?" says the Sept. 30 TV ad. "This: with a stroke of a pen Scott passed some of the most extreme anti-choice laws in the country. Laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion, even in cases of rape or incest." "Rick Scott celebrated taking away your voice and your choice," the ad concludes. We have written a lot about Crist’s record of conflicting statements about abortion -- though in this campaign he has been endorsed by Planned Parenthood. Scott, meanwhile, has consistently favored abortion restrictions. We wanted to know if the ad accurately presented what Scott signed into law. We found it was largely correct; Scott did sign legislation that restricted access to abortion. But there a few details here that are important. Scott signed ultrasound bill in 2011 In 2011, Scott signed four abortion-related bills, including one that required all women to receive an ultrasound before undergoing an abortion. Crist had vetoed a similar ultrasound law in 2010, calling it "almost mean-spirited." That was shortly after he left the GOP for his failed bid as an independent candidate for U.S. Senate. The law Scott signed requires women to get the ultrasound as well as an opportunity to review the ultrasound and have it explained to them. (Women can decline to review the ultrasound if they sign a form.) Previously, Florida law required ultrasounds prior to second trimester or later abortions, not first trimester abortions. Though the former law didn’t require first trimester ultrasounds, 29 of 31 abortion clinics did them anyway. The Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog reported that a month after signing the bills in 2011, Scott held a ceremonial signing with dozens of abortion opponents -- that’s the "party" that the ad references. "You should have the opportunity to see see an ultrasound of your child," Scott said in 2011. "It's your choice. You don't have to. This creates choice. I think it's very positive." Abortion law about viability in 2014 Crist’s ad also says Scott signed a law "restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest." That refers to HB 1047, which Scott signed in 2014 to change the timeline for cutting off abortions. The bill banned abortions once a fetus is considered viable, which is typically around 23 or 24 weeks of gestation. Previously, Florida banned abortions in the third trimester, or starting about two weeks later than the new restriction. The main purpose of the 2014 bill was to make all abortions occur earlier -- no matter if the pregnancies were a result of rape or incest. The new law only allows abortion after the point of viability to save the woman’s life or prevent major permanent damage "other than a psychological condition." It doesn’t mention rape or incest. The previous law didn’t mention rape or incest, but it did include a broad exception to "preserve the health of the pregnant woman." That broad language was what some people interpreted to potentially include rape or incest survivors. In reality, however, no woman has received a third-trimester abortion under any exception between 2011 and so far in 2014, according to state data. In 2013, 91 percent of abortions were in the first trimester and 9 percent in the second trimester, according to state data. So that means that women who want to terminate pregnancies that occurred as a result of rape or incest can still do so in the first semester and most of the second trimester -- depending on when a doctor determines viability. Rape and incest are rarely cited in abortions, according to state data. In 2013 there were about 73,000 abortions -- two were in cases of incest and about 272 due to rape -- so combined that equals less than one percent. At the time, Scott spokesman John Tupps wrote in a statement about the law that "Gov. Scott is pro-life and was glad to sign this bill that protects the lives of children." We asked Scott campaign spokesman Greg Blair if Scott supports the rape/incest exception throughout pregnancy or only until the point of viability and Blair told us that he supports those exceptions in "all cases." We asked why Scott then signed the law this session that doesn’t include those exceptions. We didn’t get a response. Finally, the ad said Scott signed "some of the most extreme anti-choice laws in the country." That’s a subjective call, but we should note that Florida hasn’t had widespread clinic closures. A Texas law caused 13 abortion clinics to close there. In Florida, there were 68 abortion clinics when Scott took office and there are 65 now. (Seven closed under Scott, but four new ones opened.) And, Florida had restrictive laws about abortion before Scott took office. Americans United for Life, a group that opposes abortion rights, ranked Florida 26th among states for restricting abortion in 2010 and 25th among states in 2014. NARAL, an organization that supports abortion rights, has given an "F" to about half the states, including Florida. Our ruling Crist said in an ad that Scott signed "laws requiring mandatory ultrasounds and restricting access to abortion even in cases of rape or incest." Scott signed a law in 2011 that requires ultrasounds for all women before they get an abortion, and in 2014 he signed a law that stated women could not have an abortion after the point of viability. That means women could not have an abortion about two weeks earlier than before. The only stated exception was to save the woman's life. However, the previous law didn’t expressly include those exceptions either, though it had broad language that could potentially have been used to seek abortion for a rape or incest survivor in the third trimester. No woman, though, has had an abortion in Florida during the third trimester for any reason in recent years, even before the new law. The statement is accurate, but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-10-07T14:26:13	2014-10-01	['None']
pomt-13061	Says John Bolton supported the Iraq War and said last year that "I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/17/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-john-bolton-still-thinks-iraq-war-w/	It's speculated that one of Donald Trump’s potential nominees for secretary of state is former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. Bolton received some hostile fire this week from a senator on his own side of the aisle. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blasted Bolton in a column on the media platform rare.us: "Rumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid." Paul is a libertarian who has often expressed skepticism about the United States launching wars overseas. Bolton is a staunch hawk who served as part of the national security brain trust of then-President George W. Bush during the launch of the Iraq War. In his column, Paul said Bolton was "one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. ‘I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,’ Bolton said just last year." In recent years, many Americans have turned against the war -- 51 percent in Gallup’s most recent poll, taken in June 2015 said it was a mistake, and Trump himself repeatedly argued that he was against the war. (He actually wasn’t, we and other fact-checkers found.) So has Bolton really remained steadfast about the wisdom of the decision to go after Saddam Hussein? Apparently, the answer is yes. We did not hear back from either Bolton’s office or from Paul’s office. However, Paul’s column included a link to his evidence. Paul pointed to a Talking Points Memo article, which in turn referenced an article in the Washington Examiner. In the Examiner article, published on May 14, 2015, senior congressional correspondent David Drucker quoted Bolton saying, "I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct. I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces. The people who say, ‘Oh, things would have been much better if you didn't overthrow Saddam,’ miss the point that today's Middle East does not flow totally and unchangeably from the decision to overthrow Saddam alone." This supports Paul’s assertion. Before drawing a final conclusion, we looked at two additional questions. First, did Bolton complain after the fact that the article misquoted him? We asked Drucker, who said, "No, they never complained -- him or his people." And second, has Bolton said anything else since then that would make his comment in the Examiner interview outdated? The answer here seems to be no, as well. We searched in both Google and Nexis and found no contrary comments by Bolton in the subsequent year and a half. The only relevant quote we found in our searches was published on the same day as the Examiner article. It was a blog post in the Washington Post that quoted Bolton saying, "My answer would have been: 'If you knew everything you do today, of course you'd make different choices, but I'd still overthrow Saddam Hussein, who was a threat to peace and stability in the region.' " This only supports the gist of what Paul said. Our ruling Paul said Bolton was a supporter of the Iraq War who said last year, "I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct." Bolton did indeed say that to a reporter for the Washington Examiner, and he also made a similar comment published in the Washington Post on the same day.

pomt-03716	"In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year."	false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/16/americans-united-life/americans-united-life-says-1270-babies-survived-ab/	A bill requiring physicians to treat infants who survive abortion attempts is moving through the Legislature without the usual partisan fight, though some lawmakers have questioned whether it addresses an ongoing problem. An anti-abortion activist used a specific figure in a recent committee hearing to reassure lawmakers HB 1129/SB 1636 is necessary. "The tragedy of infants born alive following attempted abortions is real," said Charmaine Yoest, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, on April 9. "It is not the hypothetical that is sometimes reported. In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year." Yoest said without elaborating there are two cases in Florida. After the meeting, reporters asked Yoest about the number she used. Yoest told them the figure came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the CDC, which collects data from most state health departments on the number of legal induced abortions performed each year, does not collect data on infants who die after surviving abortion attempts. Neither does the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that supports women’s access to abortions and collects abortion data. Neither Guttmacher nor the CDC has published its 2010 data for abortions. "We have no idea where this number comes from," said Rebecca Wind, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman. A committee analysis says there is no federal requirement to report the number of infants born alive during an attempted abortions. So Rep. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, included in his legislation a requirement for physicians who perform abortions in Florida to report cases of infants born alive to the state. "If in two years time or four years time we find that there are zero cases, it’s a prayer answered," Pigman said at an April 4 committee hearing of his bill. "If we find in two years time that there’s a half dozen cases a year, then we have some issues." If there are no statistics or reporting requirements, where did Americans United for Life find this figure? We dug in. Twenty-eight states have laws protecting infants born alive. "Infants Born Alive" mirrors a federal law signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. Supporters say it is necessary to enact a state law so there is no doubt that an infant "born alive" -- defined as an infant who breathes or has heartbeats or muscle movements, regardless of whether the extraction method was natural or induced -- must be taken to a hospital for treatment appropriate for gestation age. A failed abortion could result in a live birth in a late-term abortion, which can only be performed if two physicians agree the mother's life is at risk, or if the mother was further into her pregnancy than thought. Physicians under the Florida proposal would have to provide medical care for an infant born alive after an abortion or face a first-degree misdemeanor charge. Pigman, an emergency physician, has referenced similar or exact figures as Yoest in committee hearings, but he characterized them differently and stressed the lack of exact data. In the bill’s first hearing, Pigman mentioned CDC data on deaths for infants from 22 weeks of gestation to seven days after birth called "other perinatal conditions." This category -- which totaled 1,270 deaths in 2010 -- is further broken down into categories of international medical codes for causes of death, including cardiovascular disorders (838 deaths), digestive system disorders (92 deaths), undefined cerebral problems (183 deaths) and "other conditions originating in the perinatal period" (130 deaths). "I don’t know which portion of that 1,270 were due to abortions or some other rare circumstances," Pigman said in the April 4 committee. Inside that latter subcategory -- "other conditions originating in the perinatal period" -- is a designation called "termination of pregnancy, affecting fetus and newborn." The CDC doesn’t have numbers for that designation for 2010 yet. In 2008, the CDC reported 33 deaths using that designation. Whether the abortion was elective or performed to save the life of the mother is unclear. Americans United for Life spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick said any number is problematic because abortion data is always incomplete. California, for instance, is one of a few states that does not report the number of abortion procedures that happen there. Hamrick directed us to a blog post written by the group's legal team about limited CDC data and anecdotal evidence of infants born alive, including two Florida cases of infants surviving abortion procedures (one died, one survived with catastrophic injuries) and the trial of Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell. The post does not support Yoest's specific claim about 1,270 infants who die after abortion procedures, offering instead the more nuanced breakdown for the 1,270 figure that we heard from Pigman. Our ruling Yoest said 1,270 infants in 2010 "were reported to have died following attempted abortions." The figure is based on an "other" category of perinatal deaths, but it does not mean what she says it means. Included in this category are babies who die of various other issues, mainly heart problems. We rate her statement False.

pomt-14389	"Six justices" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been "confirmed in presidential election years since 1912."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/17/gwen-moore/urging-vote-merrick-garland-congresswoman-says-6-j/	As President Barack Obama was nominating Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore argued that despite pushback from Republicans, there is precedent for a Supreme Court nomination to be approved during a presidential election year. The Milwaukee Democrat urged in a tweet on March 16, 2016 that the U.S. Senate give Garland a 'fair hearing' and a timely vote on his nomination. Her claim was made in an image she attached, which said: '6 justices confirmed in presidential election years since 1912.' Virtually since the moment it was announced that Justice Antonin Scalia had died, Democrats and Republicans have clashed over when he should be replaced. Democrats such as Moore and Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin contend that Obama should make an appointment, regardless of the fact the presidential election will be held in November 2016. Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, both of Wisconsin, argue the Senate should not confirm any nominee until after Obama is replaced in January 2017. So let’s see if Moore is right -- that six times since 1912, a justice nominated to the high court during a presidential election year has been confirmed by the Senate. The nominee According to The HIll: Garland, 63, is a 19-year veteran of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit; he currently serves as chief judge, a position he’s held since February 2013. He was nominated to that court by Democratic President Bill Clinton. He is sometimes described as a moderate, though some conservatives label him anti-gun. In nominating Garland, Obama highlighted his work as a top Justice Department official in directing the prosecution of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the 1994 Oklahoma City bombings. The president noted that Garland received past praise from John Roberts, the current chief justice, and GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. A partisan battle over the nomination is expected. Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, reiterated immediately after Obama’s announcement that Scalia’s seat should not be filled until a new president is elected. The history As to Moore’s claim, we covered much of this ground in a March 2016 fact check when Ryan said: "There is a precedent" for not nominating someone to the U.S. Supreme Court "in the middle of a presidential election." We rated his statement False. We found that going back to 1912, five nominees who were nominated during a presidential election year were confirmed: President Nominee Nomination Outcome Franklin Roosevelt (D) Frank Murphy, to replace Pierce Butler January 1940 Confirmed Herbert Hoover (R) Benjamin Cardozo, to replace Oliver Wendell Holmes February 1932 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) Louis Brandeis, to replace Joseph Rucker Lamar January 1916 Confirmed Woodrow Wilson (D) John Clarke, to replace Charles Evans Hughes July 1916 Confirmed William Taft Mahlon Pitney, to replace John Marshall Harlan February 1912 Confirmed As Moore’s tweet notes, current Justice Anthony Kennedy also was confirmed in a presidential election year -- in February 1988. President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, had nominated Kennedy in November 1987, a year ahead of the election, to replace Louis Powell, who retired. It’s worth noting that in June 1968, five months before the presidential election, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations, though there was not technically a vacancy, and neither were approved. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated. We’ll also note that in October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a "recess appointment" to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957. Our rating Moore said "six justices" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been "confirmed in presidential election years since 1912." The number is correct. Our rating is True.

pomt-10648	As secretary of the Department of Energy under former President Bill Clinton, "I created reserves of home heating oil."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/bill-richardson/he-did-as-he-was-asked/	With oil prices setting record highs and hovering around $100 a barrel, most candidates talked during a Jan. 5, 2008, debate about what they would do to bring prices down. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson talked about what he had already done. Richardson served as secretary of the Energy Department under former President Bill Clinton, from late 1998 until the end of 2000. "I went to OPEC countries and tried to get them to increase production so prices would go down," Richardson boasted. "At the time, there was a home heating oil crisis here in New England. I created reserves of home heating oil." Richardson did indeed visit several OPEC countries in the spring of 2000, including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, encouraging them to increase supply, which would help keep prices lower, according to the Energy Department Web site. Those visits followed a memorably expensive winter for New Englanders, who suffered spiking prices for home heating oil, giving rise to what many called the Northeastern home heating oil crisis. Winter prices for home heating oil in New Hampshire more than doubled from February 1999 to February 2000, when New Hampshire prices peaked at $1.89 a gallon. On July 10, 2000, President Clinton directed Richardson "to establish a 2-million barrel home heating oil component of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the Northeast." With Richardson in charge, the Energy Department established the 2-million-barrel reserve later that year. The following winter, prices fell back slightly, hovering in the mid $1.50s. The Bush administration continued the home heating oil reserves, according to the Energy Department Web site. In mid 2007, those reserves stood just shy of 2-million barrels. But that hasn't stopped prices from surging, as Richardson himself pointed out. "Look at prices now in New Hampshire, $3.20, something like that. It's the highest ever." In fact, Richardson underestimated New Hampshire prices. The weekly average topped $3.34 a gallon on Dec. 31, 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration. PolitiFact looked back at peak prices from the previous crisis. In February 2000 in New Hampshire, prices hit $1.89 per gallon. Using an inflation calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we calculated that it equaled $2.31 in 2007 dollars, more than a dollar shy of the current price. We also looked back over Energy Information Administration prices for New Hampshire going back to 1990, adjusting several price spikes for inflation. None came close to today's price. Richardson told the truth: He visited OPEC countries around the same time as the home heating oil crisis in New England, and he helped establish the home heating oil reserve. Did that reserve lower prices? That's unclear, since the reserve remains today, even though — as Richardson himself points out — heating oil prices in New Hampshire are "the highest ever." Still, Richardson earns a True.	None	Bill Richardson	None	None	None	2008-01-06T00:00:00	2008-01-05	['Bill_Clinton']
pomt-02202	Says he hasn’t changed his view on abortion restrictions.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/apr/24/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-portrays-his-view-abortion-consisten/	As Charlie Crist has been attacked for flip-flopping on an array of issues, he argued during an April 20 TV interview that one topic he has been consistent on is abortion. While Crist enthusiastically admitted he changed his view on gay marriage and now supports it, he argued with interviewer Michael Williams of WPTV about whether he changed his views on abortion. Williams: "In the heat of the campaign you were once quoted ‘listen I’m pro-life, I’m pro-gun,’ on and on and on. You changed your view on abortion as well." Crist: "That’s not true. No. I am pro-life -- by my definition." Williams: "But you changed your mind on abortion restrictions in the state of Florida. That’s a matter of record...." Crist: "I am pro-life. And what I mean by that is I am for life. I think most of us are for life. And I think that’s very important to state because even though I am pro-life, which I mean for life, (it) doesn’t mean that I want to tell a woman what to do with her body, and I never have. Even as a Republican governor I vetoed the ultrasound bill on women ... " Williams: "The ultrasound bill, yes, but on the larger issue in the prior incarnation politically of Charlie Crist, you supported abortion restrictions outside of the ultrasound bill. That's a matter of record. You have changed the nuance or your view there." Crist: "No, I haven’t. That’s not true." Crist then said he voted against a bill for a waiting period for women who wanted an abortion when he was a state senator in the 1990s. A couple of days later, at a meeting of the Capital Tiger Bay Club in Tallahassee, Crist repeated, "I also don’t want to tell any woman what to do with her body. I never have." Crist’s comments left viewers with the impression that he hasn't changed his views on abortion restrictions. But does his record back that up? Crist on abortion in the 1990s and 2006 race We’ve been tracking Crist’s views on abortion for some time now. Overall, he’s been all over the map on the issue, calling himself both "pro-choice" and "pro-life" in the past. In 1992, when he ran for the state Legislature, Crist said he was "pro-choice" but opposed state-funded abortion. Crist won that race. In 1995, Crist was a Republican state senator from St. Petersburg serving on a Senate health care committee. As he mentioned in the recent interview, Crist voted against a bill that would have required a 24-hour waiting period for women to obtain an abortion. The 3-3 vote meant that the bill failed. "I generally don't like the government telling people what to do," Crist said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. "I believe in individual rights and freedom. That's why I'm a Republican." But in 1996, the health care committee approved a waiting period bill on a 5-3 vote, after an amendment offered by Crist to restrict the bill to women younger than 18. News reports at the time said Crist favored abortion rights but wanted minors to be adequately counseled. The bill failed in the House. In March 1998, Crist took a position against abortion when he voted to override Gov. Lawton Chiles’ veto of a bill that banned what opponents call a "partial birth" abortion, a late-term procedure. The House and Senate successfully overrode the veto. When he was running for the U.S. Senate for the first time in 1998, Crist said in a questionnaire for the Times: "I am pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government." When debating his Democratic opponent, incumbent Sen. Bob Graham, Crist was asked if he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortion. "No, I would not," Crist said. "I think this is a very personal decision. And I think it is a decision that a woman should make and have the right to make after consulting with her family, her physician and her clergy but not her government." During Crist’s 2006 race for governor he again reiterated, "I don't think that politicians ought to put themselves in the place of physicians." However, he also told a priest in Pensacola that he would sign a bill outlawing abortions except when the mother’s life was at stake. But then he told an AP reporter that he would only sign such a bill if it included exceptions for rape and incest. As Crist and then CFO Tom Gallagher competed in a Republican primary, Crist launched an attack ad calling Gallagher "pro-choice" and referring to himself as "pro-life." Later, in the general election debate against Democrat Jim Davis, Crist said: "I'm pro-life on this issue, but I also understand that it's very important to respect the views of others, and I do,"' Crist said. "I don't think it's important to change the law. What I do believe is important is that we change hearts and not the law. . . . I'm pro-life and I'm proud of it, but I don't think that I should impose my will on other people as a result of it." Crist on abortion 2010-14 In January 2010, Crist’s Republican U.S. Senate campaign released a statement saying he would "fight for pro-life legislative efforts." In April, as he lagged in a primary against Marco Rubio, Crist left the Republican Party to become a "no-party affiliation" candidate. Weeks later, he vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure "punitive" and that the measure was "almost mean-spirited." Crist lost the Senate race in 2010 and left the governor’s office in January 2011. In November, he announced he would challenge Republican Gov. Rick Scott as a Democrat. Crist spokesman Kevin Cate told PolitiFact that "Charlie Crist doesn't believe it's government's role to tell women what they can or can't do with their own bodies. That's always been his position and always will be." On his campaign website, Crist states: "Charlie supports a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions — as Governor, he vetoed a measure that required women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound, a law that Rick Scott signed. Charlie believes that government should stay out of personal health decisions between a woman and her doctor." Our ruling Crist said in a TV interview that he hasn’t changed his view on abortion restrictions. We find that misleading -- unless you're talking about having views that have always been difficult to pin down. Even before he switched parties, Crist voted both for and against abortion restrictions: In the 1990s, he opposed a waiting period for adults but also backed restrictions that included a waiting period for minors and a ban on partial birth abortion. In 2010, he vetoed a bill to require women to undergo ultrasounds before they have an abortion. He's also called himself both "pro-life" and "pro-choice," and he seems comfortable offering up his own personal definitions of the terms. If he's shown a kernel of consistency, it's that he often -- but not always -- talked about being personally "pro-life" but wanting to respect the right of women to make decisions with their doctors and without government interference. Interestingly, this is not a case of a politician changing his stance after switching parties. Crist has always been all over the map on abortion. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-13845	Says he "voted to remove Common Core from our schools."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/11/ritch-workman/workman-voted-remove-common-core/	State Rep. Ritch Workman is looking to win a Florida Senate seat this fall, so he’s hoping to educate voters on his record of opposing Common Core. In an online campaign ad posted June 20, 2016, Workman said that eight years ago he "promised to go to Tallahassee and cut taxes and shrink the size and scope of government." He said he followed through, passing tax cuts, changes to government pensions and ethics reform. "I also voted to remove Common Core from our schools," he said in the video. That statement riled up groups like Florida Parents Against Common Core, which accused Workman of "misrepresenting the facts." The group supports Workman’s opponent, Rep. Debbie Mayfield, who in 2013 sponsored a bill to repeal the standards. That bill never got out of committee. But Workman told us he is telling the truth. We wanted to find out whether Workman voted to get rid of Common Core standards in Florida. A common history lesson Common Core is a set of voluntary, state-based standards developed by the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association. Created with input from teachers, parents and education experts, Common Core’s goal was to make an education in one state comparable with the education in another. The final guidelines for math and English came out in 2010, and states could then decide whether to use them. Forty-five states, including Florida, voluntarily decided to accept the standards. Like most states, Florida was good with the plan at first, and the state Board of Education adopted Common Core in 2010. But critics of Common Core attacked it as a federal takeover of education, and support for the guidelines waned. Workman describes it on his Senate campaign website as "the federal government’s effort to nationalize our public schools." But this fairly common misperception isn’t accurate. Washington is not in charge of creating or implementing the benchmarks, the states are — and they are free to change or abandon the standards as they see fit. What the federal government has done is encourage state standards and offer some grant money to aid the process. Florida, for example, won a $700 million federal grant for that purpose. That support has aroused suspicion among detractors. Florida’s method of dealing with the backlash, meanwhile, has been complex. Gov. Rick Scott initially supported Common Core, but in 2013 he ordered Florida to pull out of a consortium of states that were working together to create a new test they all would share to track progress. Eventually, the state chose to develop its own replacement to the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT. Scott also called for public hearings that led state education officials in 2014 to recommend 98 changes to the benchmarks. Those proposed changes included things like 52 new calculus goals, guidelines for subjects beyond math and English, and a cursive writing requirement. The revisions were enough for the Florida Department of Education to consider the new guidelines separate from Common Core. Policy experts we talked to said they were more like extensions of the original standards. "The resulting standards as we see them are closely aligned to the Common Core and high-quality (College and Career Readiness) standards in general," said Alyssa Schwenk, a spokeswoman at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education. The state Board of Education approved the revisions unanimously in February 2014 and renamed them the Florida Standards. So what, if anything, did Workman have to do with kicking Common Core out of class? A different standard Workman told us the votes he mentioned came during the legislative session after Scott’s intervention and the education department’s changes, which Workman said he supported. In April 2014, lawmakers passed HB 7031, a broad education bill that removed more than 30 mentions of the term "Common Core" from the books as the Department of Education adopted the Florida Standards. That bill passed the House and Senate unanimously. Workman also voted for SB 1642, which froze sanctions based on school grading for a year, while the FCAT replacement (eventually known as the Florida Standards Assessment) was created. "Those two bills repealed Common Core from the DOE's education policy," Workman told us in an email. Keep in mind, the Florida Standards had already been adopted at this point. The Legislature didn’t decide to revise the guidelines, the Board of Education did. While Workman may have opposed Common Core, the provisions he’s touting as his votes to remove the benchmarks were largely procedural after the change had already been made. So does that mean Common Core is out of Florida schools entirely? The name is certainly gone — "Common Core is out," Scott said in a 2014 interview — and the state says as much. "My understanding is that Florida is no longer a participating state," Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters told PolitiFact Florida. But the Common Core State Standards Initiative still lists Florida as a Common Core state. Olympia Meola, a spokeswoman for the Council of Chief State School Officers, told us the map showing those states on the initiative’s website lists both "states that have adopted the standards without any changes and those that have built upon and updated the Common Core State Standards to further fit their state’s unique context and priorities." "It is common practice for states to revise their academic standards periodically, and, in doing so, to build upon previously adopted standards," Meola said. That’s what Florida did by adopting the Florida Standards. Blair Mann, spokeswoman for the pro-Common Core nonprofit Collaborative for Student Success, noted "the standards are still remarkably similar, and considered comparable to, the Common Core State Standards that other states are implementing." So while the term "Common Core" is gone, the bones of the standards remain. That means it’s not quite accurate to say Common Core is gone. A better term may be to say it has evolved. Many critics of the Florida Standards agree, saying the new standards didn’t go far enough, and were essentially based on Common Core guidelines with "cosmetic changes." That makes it difficult for Workman to make the claim he did, according to Abigail Swisher, an analyst at the New America Foundation’s Education Policy Program. "Given that Florida is still designated a Common Core State, it would appear contradictory for any one person to claim that they have ‘removed’ the Common Core in that state," she said. Our ruling Workman said he "voted to remove Common Core from our schools." Workman did vote to literally remove the term "Common Core" from state records as Florida switched over to the revised Florida Standards. Indeed, the broad education bill that made it law was voted for unanimously. But that was only after the Board of Education, and not the Legislature, agreed to revise the Common Core standards. Workman’s vote did not affect the decision to make that change. Furthermore, the new benchmarks were largely additions to the original standards, so it’s difficult to definitively say Common Core is out of schools. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01113	A recent economic uptick appears to "coincide" with "the expectation of a new Republican Congress."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/08/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-economic-uptick-coincides-exp/	In remarks from the Senate floor, newly elevated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested that his party’s takeover of Senate control "appears to coincide" with recent good economic news. "After so many years of sluggish growth, we’re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope," McConnell said. "The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration’s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress." McConnell stopped short of saying the Republican Senate takeover actually caused an economic improvement, though many media observers assumed that was what he was trying to imply. In the liberal New Republic, Brian Beutler joked, "It absolutely does coincide with the expectation of a new Republican Congress. Relatedly, things that coincide are called ‘coincidences.’ " But is McConnell even right that the economic data and the political expectations coincided? We focused on two questions. First, when did "the expectation of a new Republican Congress" actually solidify? And second, was there an uptick in economic data that actually coincided with that time frame? We’ll also briefly address the question of causation, even though McConnell didn’t explicitly claim that. The data we found suggest McConnell is engaging in some wishful thinking. When did "the expectation of a new Republican Congress" actually emerge? To answer this question, we checked with political analysts who handicapped the 2014 battle for the Senate and also looked at poll-based forecasting models. McConnell said "expectation," a stronger word than "possibility" and one that requires a reasonable degree of consensus. Going into the 2014 Senate elections, most observers expected the GOP to gain seats, due primarily to a favorable map for the GOP (far more Democrats were up for re-election, especially in conservative states) combined with the longstanding history of "six-year-itch" midterm elections bedeviling second-term presidents, in this case Democrat Barack Obama. But whether the GOP would actually manage to win enough seats to seize control of the chamber -- six -- was less certain. Going into the election, the Democrats held a 55-45 edge (counting two Democratic-caucusing Independents as Democrats). With many individual races rated as highly competitive right through Election Day, winning a net six seats was no slam dunk. Jennifer Duffy, who handicaps Senate races for the Cook Political Report, said different political experts settled on a Republican takeover at different times but added that she felt "pretty comfortable with a gain of six seats around Labor Day," which was on Sept. 1 last year. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, agreed that Labor Day was a turning point, though he added that "there were slivers of doubt right up until the end. We formally called the Senate for the Republicans the week before the election, but we also suggested that a GOP Senate was likely in the months prior to the election." The forecasters at fivethirtyeight.com suggested the toss-up lasted past Labor Day. They calculated the likelihood of a GOP takeover at just over 50 percent as late as mid September, before rising again, ultimately to 76 percent on the eve of the election. The New York Times’ in-house forecast saw much the same pattern, narrowing to essentially a coin flip in mid September before climbing to a 75 percent chance of a GOP takeover by Election Day. All told, this suggests that an "expectation" of a GOP takeover didn’t emerge until the beginning of September at the earliest, and possibly as late as the second half of September. This leads to our next question. Has there been an economic "uptick" that "appears to coincide" with this timeline? McConnell’s office pointed us to the announcement that the economy grew at an annualized 5 percent rate in the third quarter of 2014, the biggest expansion in more than a decade. So we’ll start there. The figure was indeed impressive. But there are two problems with citing this as evidence for McConnell’s point. First, the third quarter covers July, August and September. So the bulk of this growth occurred before the expectation of a GOP Senate began to jell. Second, GDP growth for the second quarter -- covering April, May and June of 2014 -- was almost as impressive, 4.6 percent. And that was well before the "expectation" of a GOP takeover seemed to take hold. (In fact, for much of that quarter, the New York Times model showed the Democrats likelier to win control than the Republicans.) Indeed, the longer-term trend for GDP growth shows that three of the past five quarters -- that is, since mid 2013 -- have exceeded 4 percent growth, and another quarter came close to that. Only one quarter, the first quarter of 2014, was a dud. So it’s not as if the impressive third-quarter growth of 2014 came totally out of the blue. Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis We also looked at another major yardstick for the economy -- the monthly change in employment. During 2014, total monthly employment gains averaged 241,000. In October -- the month after the "expectation" of a GOP takeover would have taken hold -- the gain was almost exactly that, 243,000. The November total was 321,000 -- the highest of the year, but not far out of line when compared with the general trend for job creation since early 2011 (see chart below). It’s too soon to tell whether November’s figure kicks off a new, higher threshold or whether the number settles back again into the 240,000 range. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics The strongest evidence for McConnell’s point is consumer confidence. The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment did experience an uptick between November and December, but even with this measurement, confidence had been rising consistently since July. And other evidence actually points in the opposite direction. Data for new orders of capital goods -- a good statistic for gauging how much confidence there is in future economic conditions -- actually fell every month between August and November. The question of causation Even if the statistical timeline fit perfectly, it’s worth remembering that correlation does not equal causation. "I don't think that either party has that much power to affect short-run economic movements, except by royally screwing up, and I haven't seen any evidence that the expectation of a regime change of this sort would affect economic outcomes," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. It’s even possible to draw up a theory that runs the opposite direction as McConnell’s linkage. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution, said one reason GDP and employment have increased a bit faster in recent months "is that government investment, government consumption, and public employee payrolls have recently been rising instead of falling." Given this, McConnell’s comments linking the GOP and accelerated economic growth are ironic, Burtless said, since Republicans have been at the forefront of cutting government spending and payrolls. Our ruling McConnell said a recent economic uptick appears to "coincide" with "the expectation of a new Republican Congress." Even leaving aside the question of causation, key statistics show that the economic recovery was under way well before September, which is our best estimate for when the "expectation" of a GOP Senate solidified.

pomt-05070	The United States has "the best health care delivery system in the world."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/05/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-us-health-care-system-best-world/	House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, says the health care law signed by President Barack Obama -- and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court -- imperiled the nation’s health care system. "Gov. Romney understands that Obamacare will bankrupt our country and ruin the best health care delivery system in the world," Boehner said, during the July 1, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. Boehner wasn’t the only one making that claim on the Sunday talk-show circuit. On Fox News Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., added that the U.S. has "the finest health care system in the world." A reader asked us to check whether there is any statistical evidence showing that the U.S. has "the best health care delivery system in the world." So we took a look. Boehner’s case When we asked Boehner’s office whether they had a particular study in mind, a spokesman acknowledged that there is no generally accepted measure for quality of care. However, they cited several narrower measures in which the U.S. scored well. For instance, the Commonwealth Fund rated the U.S. the best in four out of five preventive-care categories in 2004 when compared with four other advanced industrialized nations. Boehner’s office also cited data showing strong survival rates in the U.S. for patients with cancer when compared with other nations. Boehner’s office also noted that wealthy foreigners flock to the U.S. to receive care because of its cutting-edge facilities, and that the U.S. is among the leaders, if not No. 1, in medical research and pharmaceutical development. "As the speaker made clear, there are things we must do to improve the system we have, but there are many things that work well and Obamacare would only increase government involvement in patient care," spokesman Brendan Buck said. The U.S.: 37th in the world? But is there any data on the health-care system as a whole? There is, though it’s not perfect. We’ll start with a recap of our previous fact-check of the claim that the U.S. health care system ranks 37th in the world. The number refers to the World Health Organization's ranking of the United States as the 37th best health care system out of 191 countries. WHO, an arm of the United Nations, published the international comparison in its World Health Report 2000. We found that observers generally agreed on two things about the report. One, it was a landmark study that attracted a lot of attention around the world. And two, its conclusions have inspired intense controversy ever since it was released. Five factors went into WHO's calculation: • Health level, as defined by a measure of life expectancy, which shows how healthy a country's population is. This factor gets a 25 percent weight. • Responsiveness, which includes factors such as speed of health services, privacy protections, choice of doctors and quality of amenities. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight. • Financial fairness, which measures how progressive or regressive the financing of a country's health care system is — that is, whether or not the financial burdens are borne by those who are economically better off. This factor receives a 25 percent weight. • Health distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care resources are allocated among the population. This factor receives a 25 percent weight. • Responsiveness distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care responsiveness (which we defined above) is spread through society. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight. Once these statistics were collected, the WHO combined them into two summary rankings. One, called "overall attainment," is the basic weighted average of the five factors listed above. The other, called "overall performance," took that number and adjusted it for how well a country's health system was doing compared to how well WHO's experts believed it should be doing based on education level and economic resources. Using the second of the two ratings — overall performance — the United States ranks 37th. France ranked first, with the list of nations ranking ahead of the U.S. including a mix of industrialized countries in Western Europe, Scandinavia and Asia; wealthy oil producers from the Middle East; tiny realms of prosperity such as Monaco and Luxembourg; and some seemingly unlikely nations such as Colombia, Cyprus, Morocco, Dominica and Costa Rica. Using the first factor — overall attainment — the United States does better, finishing 15th. Most observers broadly agree that two of the WHO's five measures — health level and responsiveness — are reasonable. The first statistic gauges health outcomes, which are obviously a health care system's No. 1 goal, and the second seeks to measure how well a health system works when interacting with patients, another widely agreed upon mission. But there is far less consensus over the other three factors. Concerns stem from a mix of methodology and ideology. For instance, some critics, many of them conservative, reject the assumption that the rich should pay a similar percentage of their income for health care as the poor do. They argue that basic mathematics suggests that those with smaller incomes will naturally spend a larger share on highly important items such as food and health care, doing well in WHO's rankings almost requires a steeply progressive tax structure. Other studies Another study that included a smaller number of nations found the U.S. health system’s performance to be mediocre. The third edition of a periodic study by the Commonwealth Fund found that "compared with six other nations — Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom — the U.S. health care system ranks last or next-to-last on five dimensions of a high performance health system: quality, access, efficiency, equity, and healthy lives." Meanwhile, this chart by National Geographic compares health care expenditures with health outcomes and frequency of doctor visits in 20 other nations. It shows that the U.S. is a major exception, combining extraordinarily high costs, mid-level outcomes and a low frequency of doctor visits. The U.S. system does a good job at some things, such as keeping down wait times. A study of five English-speaking countries found that in the U.S., only 5 percent of patients reported a wait longer than four months for surgery, compared to 23 percent in Australia, 26 percent in New Zealand, 27 percent in Canada, and 38 percent in the United Kingdom. But it does poorly in other ways -- particularly in having so many people uninsured. A paper published by Urban Institute scholars in 2009 noted that the U.S. was one of only three countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the group of advanced industrialized nations -- with a sizeable share of its population lacking coverage. The others were Mexico and Turkey. (A wide range of other international comparisons are linked to here, though most of them tackle different questions, such as spending on health care, than Boehner addressed in his Face the Nation comment.) Glen Whitman, a professor of economics at California State University at Northridge, has offered strong criticism of the WHO’s methodology in a paper for the libertarian Cato Institute. Still, he suggests that Boehner went too far with his claim. "The assertion that the U.S. is ‘the best’ across the board has little support -- as does the assertion that the U.S. is ‘the worst,’" Whitman said. "It's a mixed bag. We're better in some ways, worse in others -- and in many categories of potential comparison, there's just not good evidence available, so we have to remain agnostic. People who assert confidently that the U.S. health care system is simply ‘the best’ are probably doing so out of national pride." Our ruling It’s true that specific aspects of the U.S. health care system are either the best or among the best in the world. But other aspects of the U.S. system fall short of what other advanced nations provide. Boehner’s claim that the United States has "the best health care delivery system in the world" is too glib to accurately characterize a much more nuanced reality. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2012-07-05T10:25:05	2012-07-01	['United_States']
pomt-15072	Says Pope Francis "took the name of a saint who basically reached out to Muslims."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/22/matthew-dowd/did-popes-namesake-st-francis-reach-out-muslims/	Pope Francis has shown an unusual readiness to take on divisive issues. He has spoken forcefully about the twin threats of global warming and runaway consumerism. The pope has decried the gulf between the haves and the have-nots. ABC News analyst Matthew Dowd said there’s no way to separate the pope’s visit to the United States from the ideological conflicts that dominate the American political scene. "He's coming in as basically not only a spiritual leader, but a political leader that everybody is going to have to, in the course of that, respond to," Dowd said on ABC’s This Week on Sept. 20, 2015. Then, Dowd made passing reference to tensions between the West and the Islamic world and brought up an historical point about Pope Francis. "He took the name of a saint who basically reached out to Muslims," he said. This piqued our curiosity. St. Francis of Assisi lived in the early 1200s during the Crusades, so he might have had contact with the Arab world. The order he founded - the Franciscans -- embraced poverty and service to the poor as the purest expression of Christ’s teachings. He saw animals as his brothers and sisters and is the patron saint of the environment. We decided to dig in on the Muslim angle. Dowd told us he learned this about St. Francis from a number of biographies and articles he’s read over the years. "St. Francis journeyed to see the sultan in the midst of the Crusades," Dowd said. That fits with the historical record, we found. But what St. Francis did during his time with the sultan and the aim of his visit is far less certain. That said, the meaning of "reaching out to Muslims" is broad enough to cover Dowd’s statement. As interesting as anything else, we learned that in invoking this episode, Dowd joins a long line of people who have applied various interpretations to this moment in the life of St. Francis. The Fifth Crusade From 1217 until about 1229, various Catholic leaders launched forays into the Middle East. In 1219, Cardinal Pelagius led a crusade against al-Kamil the Sultan of Egypt. The cardinal’s forces seized the city of Damietta and were able to hold it for a time, but not do much more. St. Francis made it to Damietta in July or August 1219. John Tolan is a professor of medieval history at the University of Nantes in France, and the author of St. Francis and the Sultan. Tolan’s book provides this description of what St. Francis did next, taken from a letter written in early 1220 by Jacques de Vitry, the bishop of Acre who was in the Damietta encampment at the time. "He was so inflamed with zeal for the faith that he did not fear to cross the lines to the army of our enemy. For several days he preached the Word of God to the Saracens and made little progress. The Sultan, king of Egypt, privately asked him to pray to the Lord for him, so that he might be inspired by God to adhere to that religion which most pleased God." We found no dispute that St. Francis indeed spent a few days with the sultan. Another historian, Lawrence Cunningham, professor emeritus of theology at the University of Notre Dame and the author of Francis of Assisi: Performing the Gospel of Life, said in a 2006 interview that there’s other evidence of the meeting. "My book mentions an Arabic inscription in stone in a Cairo museum that recounts the caliph spoke to Western holy men," Cunningham said. "You also can see in Assisi a gift from the caliph to Francis: a piece of ivory horn on a gold stand." If meeting with the sultan falls within the meaning of reaching out, then St. Francis reached out to the Muslims. Beyond that, the story gets murky. A range of interpretations Tolan told us no one knows much more than that St. Francis spent time with the sultan and returned safe and sound. "What the two men said to each other has been a matter of speculation ever since the meeting itself in 1219," Tolan said. "St. Francis has indeed come to represent, for 21st-century Catholics -- especially but not only Franciscans -- a voice for peace and in particular for dialogue with Islam. This was not always so. For his 13th-century Franciscan hagiographers, he went to Egypt principally because he was hoping to obtain the crown of martyrdom. It is all of course a matter of interpretation, all the more so as Francis himself never wrote anything about Islam." There are apocryphal stories that the sultan had St. Francis walk over a bed of crosses, or even challenged him to walk over a bed of coals. These are later embellishments to the tale. In his book and a shorter article, Tolan wrote that over the centuries, St. Francis has been cast as "a scholastic theologian proving the truth of Christianity, a champion of the crusading ideal, a naive and quixotic wanderer, a crazed religious fanatic, or a medieval Gandhi preaching peace, love and understanding." Paul Moses, a professor of English at Brooklyn College, wrote the book The Saint and the Sultan: The Crusades, Islam and Francis of Assisi's Mission of Peace. Moses agrees with other researchers that St. Francis’s main goal was to convert the sultan to Christianity. That was certainly the presumption at the time, based on the letter from the bishop of Acre. Cunningham at Notre Dame also assumes that was the goal. But Moses sees evidence that St. Francis represented more. "Upon his return home, Francis advocated a revolutionary new way for his friars to interact with Muslims, Moses said. "Rather than preach at them, he said, they could just live peacefully among them and even ‘be subject’ to them. So here he is reaching out not just to the sultan but to Muslims in general." Moses pointed us to the Early Rule, St. Francis’s first recorded guide for members of his order. In it, St. Francis says friars who go to the land of "the Saracens and other nonbelievers" can choose to act in two ways: "One way is not to engage in arguments or disputes but to be subject to every human being for God's sake and to acknowledge that they are Christians. The other way is to announce the Word of God, when they see it pleases the Lord, in order that (unbelievers) may believe in almighty God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, the Creator of all, the Son, the Redeemer and Savior, and be baptized and become Christians because no one can enter the kingdom of God without being reborn of water and the Holy Spirit." For Moses, the first option in particular speaks to a sort of religious tolerance. In contrast, Tolan describes the relevant section as "basically a string of gospel citations" that is "quite ambiguous." Our ruling Dowd said that Pope Francis’ namesake, St. Francis, reached out to Muslims. The historical record tells us that indeed, St. Francis, likely at great personal risk, left the safety of the crusaders’ camp and spent a few days with the Sultan of Egypt. No one actually knows what the two men said to each other. From all that we read and heard from historians, the presumption is that St. Francis tried to convert the sultan. Over the centuries, depending on the point a person wanted to prove, the story has been presented in different ways. In some versions, St. Francis challenges the Muslims. In others, he is attempting to bridge a religious gulf. The word "outreach" can have different meanings. The record doesn’t clarify the nature of the outreach, but, taken broadly, it does confirm that some kind of meeting took place. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-08763	"Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds"	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/26/anthony-gemma/gemma-says-bill-lynch-told-three-lies-10-seconds/	When congressional candidate Anthony Gemma sent out a news release with the headline "Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds," he practically challenged PolitiFact to check the accusation. Not only did he call one of his Democratic primary opponents a liar, but in specifying a time frame, he forced us to pull out our stopwatch. The action started during the 1st Congressional District debate Aug. 18 on WPRO (630-AM) radio when the two candidates took several good shots at each other. A day later, Gemma ratcheted up the rhetoric by sending out a news release that accused Lynch of multiple lies -- and fast ones at that. It was part of what Gemma calls his "Enough is Enough Initiative," his vehicle for attacking opponents. A video tape of the debate shows this is what Lynch said: "What I am going to tell Anthony, and it’s understandable that he wouldn’t know — not having been involved, not even registered to vote as recently as a few years ago, and someone who didn’t bother to vote in the last crucial presidential election, has only been a Democrat for a couple of months, and really his only involvement in the governmental process in Rhode Island has been to support Governor Carcieri." First of all, Lynch's somewhat rambling statement is more like 23 seconds. If you cut out the introductory clauses, it gets down to about 15 seconds. Either way, it’s not 10. And Lynch makes five claims, not three. Let's take a look at them, point by point. Keep in mind that we're fact-checking Gemma's statement. But to do so, we need to check what Lynch said. 1) Gemma has not been "involved" in politics. We can't evaluate this one, because it's a subjective comment, not a fact. 2) Gemma was "not even registered to vote as recently as a few years ago." Gemma told us he first registered in Providence many years ago, moving his registration to Cumberland when he relocated there in the 1990s, before moving again, to Lincoln, in 2004. The Cumberland Board of Canvassers has a record showing Gemma registered to vote there in 1998. In Lincoln, town records show Gemma has been registered to vote since 2004 and voted in the November 2004, 2006 and 2008 elections. It was difficult to verify Gemma's entire registration history, in part because of record-keeping problems at the boards of canvassers and the move from paper to computer records. But we verified that Gemma has been registered for at least six years, so Lynch's second claim is false. 3) Gemma "didn’t bother to vote in the last crucial presidential election." The Lynch team now says it was referring to Gemma's failure to vote in the March 2008 presidential primary. But the Lincoln Board of Canvassers and the secretary of state's office both confirm that Gemma voted in the November 2008 general election. So Lynch is wrong on that one too. (For the record, we asked Gemma whom he voted for, and he said Barack Obama.) 4) Gemma "has only been a Democrat for a couple of months." Records from Lincoln and the secretary of state show that Gemma registered as a Democrat in May 2010 -- the month before he announced his candidacy for Congress. Prior to that, he was registered as unaffiliated since 2004. When we asked Gemma why he accused Lynch of lying about this fact, he insisted he has "always been a Democrat" even if his voter registration doesn't indicate so. He can call himself whatever he wants, but his official designation tells a different story. Therefore, Lynch's claim is true. 5) "Really [Gemma’s] only involvement in the governmental process in Rhode Island has been to support Governor Carcieri." Gemma’s campaign finance reports show that in recent years he gave about $3,000 to a small group of candidates. Carcieri received the largest sum: $1,000, almost a third of the total. But Gemma also donated to U.S. Rep. James Langevin, Lt. Gov. Elizabeth Roberts and former Providence Mayor Joseph Paolino, a developer. So Lynch's claim is false. Now let’s get back to Gemma's original accusation: "Bill Lynch told three lies in ten seconds." As we know there were five statements -- of which we checked four -- and it was at least 15 seconds, not 10. So we’re not sure how Gemma did his timing. His explanation: if you take any three of these claims they’ll add up to 10 seconds. That's very creative timekeeping. But we understand we're nitpicking. So let’s look at the more substantive part of the claim. Three of the four factual accusations Lynch made were wrong. Whether they were lies or misstatements is for someone other than PolitiFact to decide. Remember though, we’re ruling on what Gemma said, not Lynch's accuracy. While Lynch’s claims might have warranted a check, Gemma trumped them by putting out a news release that was intended to be provocative. Instead of just pointing out Lynch’s inaccuracies, he called him a liar and he cited a precise time frame. Neither point was completely right and Gemma deserves to be called out on that. But the meat of what Gemma said about his opponent's accusations was correct. So we’ll give him a Mostly True.	None	Anthony Gemma	None	None	None	2010-08-26T00:01:00	2010-08-19	['None']
pomt-05045	Cuts in local government and school funding in John Kasich’s budget caused "many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/11/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-kasich-budget-forced-lo/	After a recent appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press" in which Gov. John Kasich said he had balanced Ohio's budget and cut taxes, the Ohio Democratic Party issued a statement that his budget had negative consequences for local communities. "Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone," the statement said, "causing many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs" to offset budget cuts. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim. The governor's office answered with its own statement. It said the number of local government workers in Ohio has increased under Kasich after decreasing under his Democratic predecessor, Ted Strickland, and that the number of local tax issues has declined. PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued. Kasich and other Republicans often talk about shrinking the size of government. We found he was accurate, three months ago, when he said the number of state workers in Ohio had gone down. So it was something like a "man bites dog" story for him to boast that local government employment increased on his watch after declining under a Democratic administration. Kasich's spokesman referred us to the employment database of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. It showed that the number of local government workers in Ohio in July 2011, when the Kasich budget went into effect, was 520,600. It was 526,200 in preliminary numbers for May, the most recent number available -- an increase of 5,600 workers. The number stood at 554,700 in July 2007, when the first Strickland budget went into effect, and 523,400 in June 2011 -- a decrease of 31,300. The decrease continued until last January, when it reached 520,000, the lowest level since 1999. The peak of local government employment in Ohio was 560,600, reached in July 2004, according to the BLS. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols also pointed to the local election tallies on the Ohio secretary of state website. The figures show "tax issues were at the lowest levels since 2003," he said, countering the claim that Kasich's budget led to local tax increases. We looked, though we find it difficult to draw any conclusions about local finances from a simple count of the number of tax issues on local ballots. For consistency of comparison, we looked at November general-election tallies. (There has been one November general election and one spring primary since Kasich's budget went into effect.) What we found was a general consistency in the number of tax issues: a total of 1,009 last November; 1,059 in November 2010; 1,100 in November 2009; 1,053 in November 2008, and 995 in 2007 -- the lowest level in the years for which a local issues summary was available. Kasich's two-year budget, signed a year ago, cut state funding for local governments by about $630 million over the two years, and cut funding for schools by about $700 million. The governor challenged local governments to be more efficient and creative to deal with the cuts without raising taxes. Ohio Democratic Party Spokesman Jerid Kurtz cited 10 municipalities and school districts looking at layoffs and tax hikes that officials blamed on the funding cuts. One was the city of Lima. Its finance director said it had a balanced budget as recently as 2008, but faced a $2 million deficit in its general fund, largely because of state budget cuts, despite "reducing the general fund consistently for the past 10 years," the Lima News reported. Another was Sycamore Township, near Cincinnati. It laid off most of its firefighters in May 2012 because, township officials said, state budget cuts would eliminate half of the community's general fund revenue. A third was the Berea school district, which passed a 3.9-mill operating levy in March 2012 after reducing its budget by $5.1 million for reasons that included the loss of state dollars. According to the Ohio School Boards Association, school levies passed in March 2012 at an "exceptionally high" rate of 74 percent, the highest level since November 2000. The usual passage rate for school levies in Ohio is about 54 percent, the group said. The growth in local government employment "is more likely due to the Ohio recovery that began a full year before Kasich took office," Kurtz said. "There is absolutely no proof Kasich's budget is the cause." Seeking further perspective, we called the Ohio Municipal League, which lobbies for cities and villages. Communications director Kent Scarrett said he "certainly" agreed "there is more of an uptick in school levies" because of state funding cuts, and said the full impact has not yet been felt. The biggest cuts in direct payments to municipalities through the Local Government Fund will come in year two of Kasich's budget in 2013. The elimination of the estate tax in 2013, which is also part of the budget, will further reduce revenue to local governments. "They're going to be up against it next year," Scarrett said. "In 2013 the cuts are going to be much more profound. It's kind of scary." That's looking into the future, which we won't do. Let's get back to the statement we're checking: "Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone," causing many communities to seek tax increases and lay off workers. The claim is partially accurate. Kasich's budget did cut funding for local governments significantly. Some school districts and municipalities have sought, considered or passed tax issues to deal with budget shortfalls to which the funding cuts have contributed. And the Ohio Democrats can provide anecdotal evidence that some budget shortfalls have threatened or led to layoffs. But the claim also overlooks important details that give the it context. The number of local government jobs in Ohio has actually increased since Kasich's budget was enacted, after dipping to a 12-year low. And the number of local tax issues to appear on ballots across Ohio has been steady for several years. Further, one of the outside experts we talked to says it is too soon to tell the full impact of cuts in funding because the biggest cuts through the Local Government Fund haven’t kicked in yet, nor has the elimination of the estate tax. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.	None	Ohio Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-07-11T06:00:00	2012-06-03	['None']

This is a very serious accusation. It taints my name, it taints Malta's name." We searched Nexis for credible news accounts about Miss Universe and the Heathrow airport and cocaine and found an example of a real life pageant queen busted for cocaine -- but more than 30 years ago. Heather Michelle Ross, who represented Bermuda in a Miss World contest, pleaded guilty in 1983 to smuggling cocaine the previous year. A customs officer told the court that about 2.2 pounds of cocaine was found concealed in her suitcase after she arrived at Heathrow airport. We found the information in articles by United Press International and the Miami Herald. We found no contact information on the states-news.com website.

pomt-13990	Polls show Bernie Sanders would do better than Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head battle against Donald Trump.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2016/jun/08/georgians-bernie-sanders-president/pro-sanders-group-target-about-their-candidates-po/	Georgia supporters of Bernie Sanders are vastly outnumbered. The Peach State is solidly red -- all statewide offices are held by Republicans. And Sanders was trounced by Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton (71 percent to 28 percent) in their March 1 primary here. But Sanders’ supporters insist there is a larger point to be made as Clinton and Sanders get ready for the June 7 California primary. Despite the fact that Clinton is well positioned to get enough delegates to take the Democratic nod, Sanders is the better choice when it comes to a head-to-head matchup with presumed GOP nominee Donald Trump, according to Sanders’ Southern backers. And they took to Facebook recently to insist that a cross section of polls backs them up. Could the group Georgians for Bernie Sanders for President be correct? Do the polls suggest Sanders would run stronger against Trump than Clinton? PolitiFact looked at a similar statement by Sanders himself earlier this year. That fact check looked at polls from January and February. We rated it Mostly True. We reached out to the Sanders and Clinton camps for their reads on the more recent polls. Clinton’s campaign did not respond. Clinton has previously said she will win the nomination and is focusing on Trump. Warren Gunnels of the Sanders campaign provided a series of polls from Real Clear Politics that shows Sanders leading Trump by more than 10 points. Another group of polls shows Trump and Clinton neck-and-neck. Most of the polls were conducted in mid-May. In the Clinton-Trump matchup, a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Trump up by 2 points. Trump leads Clinton by 6 points in a CBS News/New York Times poll, but Clinton is up by 3 points in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. In the Trump-Sanders contest, a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Sanders up by 15 points, while a CBS News/New York Times poll shows Sanders ahead by 13 points. A Fox News poll shows Sanders ahead by 3 points. A May 9-12 poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found Trump would best Clinton 45 percent to 41 percent in Georgia. But Sanders was favored over Trump by Georgia voters, 47 percent to 42 percent. The sweep of the poll numbers could have an impact on the remainder of the Democratic race, said state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, a Sanders delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Fort admitted that Sanders has an "uphill battle" against Clinton. "It makes the argument to the superdelegates stronger," Fort said. "And these polls are not outliers. It’s a convincing argument. "Bernie Sanders has changed the Democratic Party forever." University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato added a word of caution about reading too much into the snapshots of voters’ opinions at this stage of the contest. "Almost all polls I've seen since Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee show a close race between Trump and Clinton but a wider margin of victory for Sanders," Sabato said. "What the polls cannot show is whether this matters." He said Sanders has received relatively little vetting by the press. Sabato added that Republicans would like nothing better than to run against "a self-proclaimed socialist." "I might have missed an ad or two, but I haven't seen a single negative TV ad run against Sanders," he said. "For Clinton and Trump, being the target of negative ads is a daily hazard." Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, said Sanders shows up so strongly in head-to-head polls because Trump and Clinton have such high negatives. "General election polls don’t mean much until the conventions are over and you get to late summer or early fall," Swint said. "A lot of voters don’t look at Sanders as a legitimate threat. It’s almost like he’s an imaginary candidate." Our ruling. A pro-Sanders Facebook group in Georgia said polls indicate Bernie Sanders would do better than Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head battle with Donald Trump. Major polls support that contention. But it’s difficult to say what the polls mean at this stage of the election cycle, when Sanders -- a relative unknown on the national stage -- is theoretically pitted against two well-known personalities, each with substantial baggage. That’s important context when looking at the numbers. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6ea583f3-d5b4-48c9-8437-fda465c0798f	None	Georgians for Bernie Sanders for President	None	None	None	2016-06-08T06:00:00	2016-05-23	['Bernie_Sanders', 'Donald_Trump', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-13806	"We defied the stand-down orders" during the Benghazi attack.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/18/mark-geist/stand-down-story-ignores-critical-facts-about-effo/	When the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, came under attack on Sept. 11, 2012, the only United States force able to respond quickly was a CIA security team made of up of private contractors stationed in a nearby annex. While promoting their bestselling book on the attack, at least three members of the six-person team have asserted that they defied "stand-down" orders to rush to stop the attack, which killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens. During the first night of the Republican convention in Cleveland, one of them, Mark "Oz" Geist said that because of their actions, "there were more than 30 American lives that were saved that night. And it’s because Americans never give up. We refuse to lose. Benghazi has been a four-letter word for the left but is not about politics. Benghazi was about opportunities. Opportunities taken when we defied the stand-down orders." We talked about the stand-down issue when we gave Fox News' Sean Hannity a Mostly False for his assertion that "during the (Benghazi) attack, a stand-down order was given, and our troops were told to change their clothes four times." Our ruling was based on the Republican-written report on the crisis, released June 28 by the House Select Committee on Benghazi. We'll use that report as the basis for this fact-check as well. Technically, when a military force is told to "stand-down," it means the force is no longer on alert or operational. It's clear from the report, though, that the security team never stood down. Whether the team was ever told to stand down is a matter of debate. It was told to wait, for reasons the report makes clear. The attack on the Benghazi compound began at 9:42 p.m. At the time, according to the report, the United States was working with several militia groups that were active and cooperative after the regime of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled a year earlier. One militia group was the Feb. 17 Martyrs Brigade, which had pledged to help with compound security. When the attack began, a frantic call for help was made to the CIA annex about a mile away. The annex security team, known as the GRS, started getting their gear together as annex officials made fruitless calls trying to contact the local groups — including the Feb. 17 militia. Their goal: find out who was involved in the fight and whether they could get additional equipment for the security team. The GOP report goes into this issue in some detail. The unnamed man in charge of the CIA annex, the chief of base, told the committee that the leader of the security team asked for a gun truck from the Feb. 17 militia. The chief made the call and was told one wasn't available but they would try to work on it. The report says the base chief "was adamant that he never told the Annex team members to 'stand down,'" quoting him as saying he was working with the team leader "the whole time in an effort to get them, go get them gone, to have them go." "I never had any doubt about the GRS people going to the State Department compound." he base chief told the committee. "I had great concerns and great worry about it, but I did not, I did not tell anybody to stand down." But he did tell them to wait so he could try to get the gun truck for them, "but it wasn't 10 minutes, or five minutes," he also said, "There was nobody, myself or anybody else in Benghazi, that did anything to hold up the GRS deploying. The team lead was always cleared to go. ... I think I carried an ammo can at one time to get those guys out the door." The deputy chief of base, according to the report, told the committee that the team leader told him and the base chief, "We got to go get those guys. And the Chief of Base responded, 'Absolutely.' 'Absolutely.' Not, 'I got to go call the chief of station.' Not, 'I got to go check with somebody in Washington. All he said was, 'Absolutely.' "So I want to make that very clear because I know there’s conflicting accounts about that discussion," he said. "There were three people in that discussion: myself, the GRS team leader, and the chief of base. And anybody writing any books or making movies, or whatever else, I can tell you none of those guys (who claim there was stand-down order) were in the room when that discussion occurred." The decision to allow the six to go was made even though it would have left the CIA annex essentially defenseless, according to the officials. They were also trying to contact the militia so the squad wouldn't get into a firefight with friendly militia forces. "I feel like the narrative that I have seen in public does not account for this and does not account for the consideration that there was a green-on-blue situation that could have wiped all of those guys out. And then where would we have been?" the deputy CIA chief of base said. "We wouldn’t have had the ability to do anything to help the State Department people, and we wouldn’t have had the ability to evacuate ourselves or defend ourselves if we came under attack." Video from the annex showed that 23 minutes elapsed between the time of the frantic call from the mission to the time the annex team was rolling. The report says another member of the security also could not recall the chief ever saying the stand down, "but he did recall the chief of base telling them to wait." "I respected the fact that he wanted us to wait and see if he can gather additional fire power to help," he told the committee. "At some point, though, the wait was too long, and we decided, you know, we couldn’t wait any longer and we left." Other team members also recalled being required to wait while the base chief, his deputy and the team leader worked the phones to get information or assistance. But one did put it this way. "And I just say: Hey, you know, we've got to get over there. We're losing the initiative. The chief of base looks at me, he says: Stand down, you need to wait. You need to come up with a plan." According to the report, that security team member was asked why he had not disclosed the "stand-down" order during previous testimony to Congress. He didn't give a direct answer. "I just know when we got told to stand down and when (the team lead) kind of gave the brief of kind of like why we're told to stand down, it was kind of understandable, you know." Kris Paronto, a former Army ranger hired for the team, told Hannity in a June 28 interview, "Twice the word 'wait' was used. Once the words 'stand down' was used. But to me that's semantics." We don't think so. Being told to stand down means you're not going. According to all the evidence in the GOP report it's clear that — short of some sudden intervention by Benghazi militia friendly to the United States coming in to save the day — they were. Our ruling Geist said, "We defied the stand-down orders" during the Benghazi attack. All the evidence suggests that if the phrase "stand down" was used by officials — and there's debate about that — it was said only once in an effort to buy time to get intelligence information and equipment to a security team that was justifiably chomping at the bit to respond. Testimony in the House Select Committee on Benghazi report shows there was no stand-down order to defy because there was never an order to not intervene in the unfolding disaster. The "stand-down" story contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/34e74e97-56fe-47b1-9036-1078e78cbb74	None	Mark Geist	None	None	None	2016-07-18T23:25:22	2016-07-18	['None']
pomt-10242	Drilling in ANWR would have minimal impact, covering only "2,000 out of 20-million acres."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/01/sarah-palin/yes-2000-acres-but-spread-all-over/	Energy exploration in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, has been a top Republican policy priority for years. And even before she joined the GOP's presidential ticket, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was making the case for oil and gas drilling in the desolate region, asserting it would lessen the United States' dependence on foreign oil. In an interview on CNBC's "Closing Bell With Maria Bartiromo" that aired on Aug. 29 (though it took place days earlier), Palin asserted energy production would cover a minuscule portion of the coastal plain on her home state's North Slope, no larger than the space of a big-city airport. "Well, ANWR at that point it's about 2,000 acres that is being asked to be looked at and to be explored and to be produced. Two-thousand acres out of 20-million acres," Palin said. "That footprint, it's about the size of LAX or one of the larger airports across the nation. And that should allow some perspective there also." ANWR comprises about 19-million acres, 1.5-million of which were set aside by Congress and President Jimmy Carter in 1980 to study the potential for energy production. But in describing the possible environmental impact, Palin is harking back to a House Republican proposal floated during energy debates in 2001 and 2003, that Democrats, environmentalists and some moderate Republicans rejected as unrealistic. Facing determined opposition to drilling for oil in the ecologically sensitive area, Republicans tried to make the idea more palatable by limiting the surface area of oil company operations in the refuge and offering to share federal lease revenue with a heating oil assistance program for low-income people. Specifically, the Republicans would have put a 2,000-acre limit on surface that could be covered by "production and support facilities, including airstrips and any acres covered by gravel berms or piers for support of pipeline." Palin and other pro-drilling lawmakers now say new technologies, including directional drilling, would probably make viable energy development possible on a footprint even smaller than 2,000 acres. But the reality of tapping the oil reserves in ANWR isn't that simple and debates over economic benefits and environmental costs rely on plenty of conjecture. An authoritative estimate of what ANWR might hold for oil production comes from a three-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey that was released in 1998, which estimates that between 5.7-billion and 16-billion barrels of recoverable oil might be found in ANWR. But the report concludes that the oil is not concentrated in a single area but is instead spread throughout the refuge, meaning the 2,000-acre cap could only be viable if those acres weren't contiguous. And, between those acres would have to be a network of roads and pipelines connecting them. In fact, the GOP proposal that would have set the 2,000-acre cap acknowledges this fact without stating it outright. For example, the legislation specified that the acres would be used on production equipment, airstrips and berms and structural supports for pipeplines. But it wouldn't include roads, and the legislation also says the acreage toward that limit only would count equipment that touches the ground so that miles of pipeline wouldn't count, only the stanchions holding it up. Environmentalists contend pipelines and roads and related infrastructure would cover a much larger area than a mere 2,000 acres, which could fragment fragile wildlife habitat. The Geologic Survey concludes that nearly 80 percent of the estimated oil reserve is thought to be located in the western part of the reserve, closest to existing roads and infrastructure. But individual drilling sites would still need to be connected with additional pipes and roads. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a drilling foe, notes that the potential for industrial sprawl is great, contending that existing production elsewhere on the North Slope, while technically takes up 12,000 acres, actually spreads across an area of 640,000 acres, or 1,000 square miles, when one includes airports, roads and gravel mines. Such arguments have carried the day in recent congressional debates over expanded drilling in the refuge. In 2001, the House endorsed the limited ANWR drilling plan, but it died during negotiations with the Senate on a broader energy bill. In 2003, a nearly identical proposal won approval in the House but was dropped during negotiations on a final energy package. Each time, Democrats and some moderate Republicans expressed deep reservations about lasting environmental damage to the ecosystem, including herds of native caribou. Republicans managed to advance a broader drilling plan out of the House in 2005, but it fell victim to a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Palin is technically correct that viable drilling operations could be confined to a small portion of the refuge. But to take full advantage of the oil resources in ANWR would almost certainly require an extensive network of roads, pipelines and related infrastructure that couldn't possibly be contained on such a footprint. Because of the economic realities associated with large-scale energy development, we find her claim Half True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-09-01T00:00:00	2008-08-29	['None']
pomt-08357	Rick Scott "has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/26/alex-sink/sink-claims-scott-said-he-wants-do-away-state-dca/	The Florida Department of Community Affairs, the state's growth management agency hated by developers, is one of the smallest state agencies. But the DCA became a big point of contention in the Oct. 25, 2010, gubernatorial debate between Democrat Alex Sink and Republican Rick Scott. During the debate at the University of South Florida televised on CNN, Sink said, according to the transcript: "Well my opponent has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs. It’s the one state agency that holds local governments accountable for the dealings they have with developers. That’s why we have Amendment 4 on the ballot because people were so frustrated about these out-of-control developments. I oppose Amendment 4 because I think it would be a job killer. But we cannot do away with our Department of Community Affairs, which is the only organization that handles growth management in Florida. He would just hand Florida over to development, to just go wild and that’s not what Floridians want." (Amendment 4, which is also on the ballot Nov. 2, would give voters the right to vote on adopting or amending local land-use plans.) Scott responded: "Let’s go back to the last question on DCA. I have not said that I would eliminate DCA. What I would do is go back to the original purpose of DCA. My opponent is an Obama liberal. She thinks people in Tallahassee can tell local communities exactly what they ought to do. Let’s look at what’s happened across our state. You can go all across the state and developments have been killed by all the regulation, all the paperwork. In fact you have to go to three or four agencies. I’ll give you an example. Down close where I live (in Naples), Ave Maria University was recently built. Just in permits, just — not any building — just for the land, 78 permits, took years to do. DCA has killed jobs all across this state. We need to go back to the original purpose." In this Truth-O-Meter we will explore, has Scott said "he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs?" First, some background on DCA that we found in an Oct. 8, 2010, St. Petersburg Times article about Scott's criticism of the state agency, and from our Oct. 26 interview with DCA secretary Tom Pelham. Created in 1969, the agency reviews growth management decisions by cities and counties and distributes federal grants for neighborhood revitalization and other programs. DCA has a budget of about $315 million -- about $27 million is state money and the rest is federal -- and about 220 employees. About 57 employees work in the growth management section. "The next governor will be forced to slash costs to cover an estimated $2.5 billion shortfall, but wiping out the DCA won't help much,'' stated the Oct. 8 article. "That's because about 10 cents of every dollar it spends comes from state taxes." The article paraphrased Pelham saying that the agency is necessary to mediate growth disputes between adjoining local governments and to review large development projects for their impacts on roads and other services. Proposals to eliminate DCA have surfaced frequently, but the agency has survived. But does Scott want to wipe it out entirely? We looked for comments Scott had made about the DCA in the campaign. • In a Sept. 18 Pensacola News Journal article about Scott campaigning alongside Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Scott was quoted as saying: "Amendment 4 would kill jobs, and like the DCA (Department of Community Affairs), it would slow down everything." • In the Oct. 8 St. Petersburg Times article, Scott didn't say if he would get rid of DCA or how he would change it -- he was only quoted as criticizing it: "On the campaign trail, I'll tell you the one that everybody's fed up with. It's DCA. It's really impacted people that want to build things. Their attitude is, 'How can somebody in Tallahassee tell my local community what we want, and DCA sits there and tells us we can't do it?' … I'll tell you, it's really killing jobs." • A columnist wrote in the Florida Times-Union Oct. 12: Scott "wants to do away with the Department of Community Affairs, the state agency that at least provides some review of land use changes." But columnist Ron Littlepage didn't attribute or explain his claim. He told us in an e-mail that he based his column on the Oct. 8 St. Petersburg Times article. • Charles Pattison, president of the environmental group 1000 Friends of Florida, wrote in a column Oct. 13 in the Gainesville Sun that "According to recent news reports, gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott would support eliminating the state's land planning agency, the Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA). He claims, 'It's really impacted people that want to build things.... It's really killing jobs.' " Again, no details showing Scott said he would eliminate it. We also looked at Scott's campaign website. Under a headline "Reduce Government Spending" Scott wrote: "A 5% reduction in the state workforce will save almost $300 million" -- but again, no specifics about the DCA. We asked Pelham directly if he had heard Scott say that he wants to eliminate DCA. "What we've heard is what was indicated in the ... St. Pete Times article in which he says DCA is really killing jobs, and everybody is fed up with DCA, etc.,'' said Pelham, who served as DCA secretary between 1987 and 1991 and was appointed again in 2007. "I don't recall reading anything where he used the words we should eliminate DCA." We also asked Pelham whether the "original purpose" of DCA had changed, since Scott said he wanted to return to that original purpose. The agency changed dramatically over the years -- at one point it also encompassed Veteran Affairs and programs dealing with juvenile justice, Pelham said. Florida didn't have the growth management act until 1985, which led to DCA overseeing the growth management office. Pelham was brought in to do that when he served as secretary from 1987 to 1991. Prior to that act, there was a division of state planning that oversaw a much weaker act that didn't give the state authority to reject comprehensive plan amendments but only give recommendations, Pelham said. If Scott wins the election, he can't simply shut down DCA. Eliminating the agency would require a vote by the Legislature and eliminating its functions or assigning them to other agencies, said Pelham. Pelham disputes Scott's claim that DCA is "killing jobs". DCA reviews proposed amendments to comprehensive plans. Since 2007, DCA has approved more than 90 percent of those amendments for 700,000 acres in land allowing an increase in residential development potential of more than a half-million units and an increase in non-residential development capacity of 1.4 billion square feet, Pelham said. "How anyone could say DCA is killing jobs is beyond me," Pelham said. "It's an irresponsible statement -- not supported by facts. I challenge anyone to show me one job the department has killed. When we say 'no,' none of our decisions are final. They are subject to appeal." Rejected applicants can appeal to an administrative law judge, then the governor and cabinet and then the district court of appeal. "We don't have final decision-making authority on anything," he said. He said his department may reject land-use amendments, for example, when people propose large developments in the middle of wetlands or that pose safety concerns. "It's not DCA that killed jobs," Pelham said. "It's the national and international global economy that has crashed." On Oct. 26, the morning after the debate, we contacted Sink's campaign by e-mail and asked for evidence that Scott said "he would do away with" the DCA. The Sink campaign sent us back quotes from the same newspaper articles or columns that we had already found. We interviewed Sink campaign spokesman Dan McLaughlin who did not point us to any proof that Scott "has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs." But McLaughlin said in an interview that Scott has sent a "clear signal" that the department should be returned to its "original purpose" which wasn't about growth management. Scott's comments, McLaughlin said, "set against the background of a very extremely conservative Legislature and sunsetting of the department that would come up in the first year of the next governor's administration, it is our belief it is totally accurate with Rick Scott as governor the DCA would go away. He has said he does not want it existing in its current form." (The "sunsetting" refers to a review by the Legislature -- earlier this year the Senate voted to let the DCA survive but the House failed to act, leaving it in limbo for now. The St. Petersburg Times article stated that Rep. Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park, the incoming House speaker, says he wouldn't mind seeing the DCA disappear.) We also contacted Scott's campaign and asked for his plans for the state agency. Scott consultant Donna Arduin said that Scott has said he will "put all regulations to a freeze and review plan so he could determine whether or not the benefits are worth the cost," but he hasn't said he would get rid of DCA. By returning DCA to its "original purpose," Scott meant "we need to make sure development meets environmental standards rather than killing jobs." We also asked Arduin to explain what Scott meant about the DCA "killing jobs." She said that some potential investors decide not to come to Florida because they determine the "length and expense of the process they must go through in Florida that other states don't have. They have to pay for consultants, lawyers, lobbyists. They have a time delay to go through the process. Even if they have a 90 percent chance of getting approved, they have now added a huge expense and delay to the potential of investing in Florida." And for investors who do proceed with development here, if they didn't have to spend money to go through the DCA process, they could use that money for other jobs, she said. She didn't have any examples of investors who turned away. Was Sink correct to claim that Scott "has said that he would do away with the Department of Community Affairs?" Sink's campaign has not produced evidence that Scott made that statement and the burden of proof is on her to back up her attack made in the final full week of the campaign. Scott has clearly criticized the agency, saying it has been "killing jobs," but during the debate he denied saying he wanted to eliminate it. Scott's campaign repeated his denial but didn't provide specifics for his plans for the DCA. So other than a review, Scott's plan for the agency, if he wins, remains a mystery. Still, without evidence that Scott said it, we rate this claim False.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-10-26T19:09:21	2010-10-25	['None']
pomt-09742	An Iowa policy "provides for a state round up of Iowa citizens who might be exposed to the swine flu virus."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/14/chain-email/e-mail-claims-iowa-policy-seeks-round-iowans-who-m/	Patty Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, has been amazed by the amount of misinformation and blatant lies swirling around about the H1N1 virus and the federal plans to distribute a vaccine. But even she was a bit thrown when a man called last month and asked her whether Iowa was creating concentration camps for people with H1N1. Seriously. "We don't have concentration camps here in Iowa," she said. And then she sighed. "Those are words I never thought I'd have to say." The rumor spread wide enough that the Iowa Department of Public Health felt the need to isssue a press release on Aug. 31 to knock it down. We're not sure what version of the chain e-mail the department got, but here at PolitiFact, a reader sent us one that claimed, "The state of Iowa has an internal document that was recently leaked on the Internet that ... provides for a state round up of Iowa citizens who might be exposed to the swine flu virus." The e-mail links to a "Facility Quarantine Order." It's a legitimate document, a template to be used in the event that Iowa ever did decide to quarantine people. It reads, in part: "The Iowa Department of Public Health (Department) has determined that you have had contact with a person with Novel Influenza A H1N1. Novel Influenza A H1N1 is a disease which is spread from person to person and is associated with fever (greater than 100.0 F), cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea (runny nose), nasal congestion, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Novel Influenza A H1N1 presents a risk of serious harm to public health and if it spreads in the community severe public health consequences may result. "The Department has determined that it is necessary to quarantine your movement to a specific facility to prevent further spread of this disease. The Department has determined that quarantine in your home and other less restrictive alternatives are not acceptable because — insert the reason home quarantine is not acceptable, the person violated a previously issued home quarantine order, the person does not have an appropriate home setting conducive to home quarantine, etc. The Department is therefore ordering you to comply with the following provisions during the entire period of quarantine." You set that to ominous music under a title calling them "concentration camps," as some have done in YouTube videos, and it comes off as pretty scary. Here's the response from Iowa officials: "To ensure there is no confusion on this issue, Iowa Department of Public Health wants to make it clear that Iowa has not issued any isolation and quarantine orders for novel influenza A (H1N1), and has no plans to issue any this fall. "In preparation for public health emergencies, these types of templates are often prepared in case they are needed, but isolation and quarantine orders are only very rarely used in very specific situations." The templates were prepared when H1N1 first reared up in Mexico, when it was feared to be much more deadly than it turned out to be, Quinlisk said. "As soon as we realized it wasn't that bad, or at least that it was similar to the seasonal flu, that was the end of that," she said. There are a couple of other claims in the e-mail we received. One is that Massachusetts state officials are "in the process of passing a law that will mandate vaccines for the swine flu." According to the chain e-mail, the bill would allow " 'authorities' to impose vaccinations. If you refuse, they can haul you away into quarantine. If you refuse that, you'll be fined up to $1,000 per day, and possibly be incarcerated in prison for 30 days." On Oct. 8, the Massachusetts legislature did sign off on a bill to tighten the powers of public health officials to isolate or quarantine people to contain the outbreak of serious contagious diseases. But that doesn't translate to "a law that will mandate vaccines for the swine flu." In fact, said Jennifer Manley, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Health, "There will absolutely, positively not be any mandatory vaccines for the H1N1 virus in Massachusetts." Most states have laws more than 100 years old that allow people who pose a public health danger to be isolated or quarantined, Quinlisk said. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many states looked into updating those laws to ensure, among other things, that people's civil rights are not violated. Some have clearly misinterpreted those efforts and assigned them insidious intent, she said. No states are considering quarantining people with H1N1. "Quarantine is a public health tool that is primarily used to keep well people who have been potentially exposed to a serious illness away from others who may be susceptible," said Christine Pearson with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It's particularly effective when a new disease has not yet been introduced into our country. Given that the virus is already widespread in the United States and worldwide and is presenting the same sort of disease we see with regular seasonal flu, CDC does not intend to issue quarantine or isolation orders for 2009 H1N1 flu at this time." The chain e-mail claims that the Iowa policy "provides for a state round up of Iowa citizens who might be exposed to the swine flu virus." The fact is that there is no mandatory order that all Iowa residents be vaccinated against H1N1, let alone a policy seeking to round up and detain people those refuse. We rule this claim False.

pomt-13986	Says he "helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/09/tim-canova/tim-canova-says-he-helped-draft-part-dodd-frank/	Tim Canova, who is in a Democratic primary battle with U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, says he pushed to crack down on the financial services industry even before the financial collapse. And, he says he played a role in the 2010 financial reform bill. Canova, a law professor and first-time candidate, said in a June 1 Medium post he "helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, one of President Obama’s signature accomplishments." Former U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., co-author of the reform bill, expressed some skepticism that Canova played a role. "He does seem to be denigrating the financial reform bill, of which I was a co-sponsor, while simultaneously claiming credit for having written it," Frank said at a press conference for Wasserman Schultz in Broward May 31. We decided to fact-check Canova’s role in helping to draft part of Dodd-Frank. Effort to audit the Federal Reserve The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was a sweeping law with multiple components intended to avert another financial meltdown. (Canova has some criticisms of the law which he details in his book, The Bottom-Up Recovery.) The part of the law Canova said he helped draft related to auditing the Federal Reserve, including its emergency lending in the aftermath of the economic collapse. At the time, Canova was a professor of international economic law at Chapman University in California. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, sought for two decades to pass a bill to audit the fed. Bipartisan interest in Paul’s pet project grew after the financial collapse. The House Financial Services Committee passed an amendment 43-26 to audit the Fed on Nov. 19, 2009. U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, whipped Democratic votes. The amendment required government audits of the Federal Reserve including how much the central bank lent to banks. Critics felt it could lead the auditors to interfere with monetary policy. "It was a major legislative achievement, the first time the Federal Reserve was subject to audit, and again over the objections of Barney Frank," Canova told PolitiFact Florida. The concern about monetary policy drew objections from Frank, Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd, the Fed and the Obama administration. So the Senate author, Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, scaled back audit powers to exclude monetary policy but include disclosing information about the emergency loans. The limited audit was included in the final Dodd-Frank bill that was signed by Obama in July 2010. Canova’s role was behind the scenes, serving as a resource to at least a couple of House and Senate staffers at the time. Canova said he was contacted by staffers on Capitol Hill after he published articles on the Federal Reserve. (One of his articles, "Financial Market Failure as a Crisis in the Rule of Law," was published in the Harvard Law Policy and Review in 2009.) He was also quoted in many news articles about the financial crisis. One of those staffers was Matt Stoller, a senior policy adviser to Grayson who worked on the amendment. Canova "was an adviser as we worked on the Federal Reserve emergency lending disclosure provisions of Dodd-Frank," Stoller told PolitiFact Florida. (In 2011, Stoller wrote an op-ed about the Federal Reserve and quoted Canova.) Another staffer was Warren Gunnels, an aide to Sanders. Canova also told Rolling Stone that he worked with some of Sanders' staff on the bill. (Gunnels now works on Sanders’ presidential campaign and did not respond to emails from PolitiFact Florida.) Sanders named Canova to a committee to advise him on Federal Reserve reform in 2011. Sanders backs Canova in his congressional race. Canova forwarded to PolitiFact Florida a few emails he exchanged with Stoller and Gunnels in July 2010 shortly before the Senate passed Dodd-Frank. For example, in an email July 13, 2010, Canova wrote to Gunnels: "I have continued working through the provisions of the Dodd-Frank conference committee bill." Canova suggested that Sanders insert into the record some clarifying language that the audit would apply to financial assistance from the Federal Reserve starting Dec. 1, 2007, through the enactment of the bill. "I am happy to claim a small bit of credit for a supporting role in helping the drafters of one of the very best provisions of the act," Canova told PolitiFact Florida. In an interview, Frank -- who is backing Wasserman Schultz -- told PolitiFact Florida he had never heard of Canova while working on the bill. As for the audit portion of the law, Frank argued Canova shouldn’t get credit because the final version didn’t include auditing monetary policy. Frank said he opposed that portion because he saw it as "political interference." Frank said he didn’t want the members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee "being called before an auditor and asked about votes on interest rates." Our ruling Canova says he "helped to draft parts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill." The Dodd-Frank bill was a sweeping piece of legislation with many components. Canova was involved in one piece of the bill. Canova played a behind-the-scenes role advising a House staff member and a Senate staff member about amendments to allow the government to audit the Federal Reserve. A scaled-back version was included in the final law. Canova didn’t contribute to the drafting of the overall bill, and he wasn't the main driver of the audit portion that stemmed from decades of advocacy by Paul. However, he did play a role.

pomt-00422	"John McCain was pardoned for treason"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/27/blog-posting/sen-mccain-did-not-commit-treason-vietnam/	After Sen. John McCain passed away on Aug. 25, publications nationwide applauded his service, both in the Navy and in the Senate. But news of McCain’s death also dragged up old claims that McCain was not the war hero he claimed to be. A 2017 article posted on Revenge of the Herd claims, "John McCain was pardoned for treason." It alleges that, during his time as a prisoner of war, McCain gave information to the North Vietnamese in exchange for better treatment, and that he would have been executed if President Richard Nixon didn’t pardon him. The story resurfaced after McCain’s death and was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s not true. McCain’s time in Vietnam, the case for treason While serving in the Navy in 1967, McCain’s plane was shot down over North Vietnam. His right leg and both of his arms were broken in the crash, and McCain was taken prisoner by North Vietnamese soldiers. He was held captive for the next five and half years, often in solitary confinement. By McCain’s account, he was frequently denied medical attention and beaten in exchange for information. The Revenge of the Herd article focuses on two alleged acts of treason. The first surrounded an allegation that McCain said he would trade information in exchange for medical treatment. In his book, Faith of My Fathers, McCain recounts the grievous wounds he suffered when he was shot down and afterward at the hands of angry Vietnamese. As we have previously written at PolitiFact, McCain was taken to the Maison Centrale, known to POWs as the Hanoi Hilton, where he did lapse in and out of consciousness for four days and refuse his interrogators' demands for information. But then, McCain recounts, he tried a different approach with a prison officer nicknamed "Bug.'' "Desperate, I tried to bargain with him. 'Take me to the hospital and I'll give you the information you want.' I didn't intend to keep my word, reasoning that after my injuries had been treated, I would be strong enough to deal with the consequences of not holding up my end of the bargain,'' McCain wrote. It’s impossible to determine everything McCain told his captors -- interrogations took place one-on-one, in secluded prisons, more than 50 years ago. Based on his personal accounts, though, McCain was used mostly for propaganda: filmmakers would show him in the hospital, being treated by the North Vietnamese. Officials also encouraged him to say that he wanted the war to end, or that he was grateful to his captors and sorry for his participation in the fighting. McCain said he refused to do so. McCain admitted he eventually gave up information about his ship and Navy squadron. "I regret very much having done so,'' he wrote. The second allegation of treason surround McCain’s signing of a confession that he was a war criminal. He did sign such a statement -- after, he says, he was beaten routinely over the course of four days. Upon returning to the United States, McCain wrote, "I reached the lowest point of my 5½ years in North Vietnam. I was at the point of suicide, because I saw that I was reaching the end of my rope." McCain’s first-hand account is corroborated by Robert Timberg, author of John McCain: An American Odyssey. Timburg spoke to other POWs to write his biography of McCain. "I've never known of any occasion in which Sen. McCain provided the North Vietnamese with anything of value," Timberg said. I beg your pardon? Even if you were to somehow buy the argument that McCain committed treason, the Revenge of the Herd article loses all credibility when it says McCain was pardoned. The article says that McCain and 33 other POWs faced a court martial for their crimes. President Richard Nixon issued a blanket pardon to all 34 POWs, including McCain. This part of the story seems to be entirely fabricated. There is no record of any legal proceedings against McCain. His name is also absent from a list of all the pardons granted by Nixon. P.S. Ruckman Jr., who studies presidential pardons and runs the website pardonpower.com, told our colleagues at Snopes there is no evidence McCain received a presidential pardon. "I have developed a researchable data set of every individual grant of clemency from 1789 to present. I have been over the data (30,000 plus cases), dozens of times over the years. John McCain’s name simply does not appear in the data," Ruckman said. Our ruling An article on Revenge of the Herd claims that "John McCain was pardoned for treason." During his time as a prisoner of war, McCain said he would trade information in exchange for medical treatment. He was also forced to sign a confession that he was a war criminal. But there is no evidence of legal proceedings against McCain when he returned to the United States. And records of presidential pardons do not include McCain’s name. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-01897	Says Mark Warner has supported Harry Reid "down the line."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/jul/06/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-warner-supports-majority-leader-rei/	Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie is continuing to attack incumbent Mark Warner as a loyal lieutenant to liberal leaders in Washington. "I would not support the president’s policies down the line and Harry Reid down the line, as Mark Warner has," Gillespie said during a recent interview on Fox News. Gillespie and the state GOP repeatedly have said Warner has voted with President Barack Obama 97 percent of the time. We rated that claim True this spring, but noted that Obama has taken a position on only 28 percent of the measures Warner has voted on. Warner’s key show of solidarity with the president was his 2010 vote to pass Obamacare. With that work behind us, we decided to probe the unexplored part of Gillespie’s claim: That Warner has supported Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nev., "down the line." Gillespie’s campaign declined to back up or explain the statement. So we went to the voting records. OpenCongress.org has a tool that compares the voting record of U.S. senators and representatives for the current two-year term of Congress, which started in January 2013. Warner voted the same way as Reid 87 percent of the time through June 24 of this year. That ties as the ninth lowest percentage among 51 Senate Democrats. The lowest correlation is owned by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., at 79 percent; the highest is 93 percent, shared by five senators. The average among all Democratic senators, excluding Reid, is 91 percent. Next, we compiled a record of the roll call votes for the previous four years in which Reid and Warner were both in the Senate. In both the 111th and 112th Congress terms, they also voted the same way 87 percent of the time. Warner and Reid have agreed on these major bills: The stimulus The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare Extending the Patriot Act, allowing increased surveillance of people suspected of terrorist activities A farm bill expanding crop insurance and trimming the food stamp program Extending a period offering lower rates for student loans Increasing debt limits Warner has opposed Reid on several key bills by voting: To overturn Environmental Protection Agency regulations to cut mercury and other emissions from coal-fired electric generation facilities Against delaying the 2013 start of automatic spending cuts in defense and domestic programs that are also known as sequestration For the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement Many of Warner’s voting disagreements with Reid occurred not in the final actions on bills, but in earlier votes on proposed amendments to them. Warner has supported a number of cost-cutting amendments that Reid has opposed. This includes Warner’s votes: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to address long-term fiscal problems To bar earmarks in several budget amendments To eliminate appropriations for security on highway buses on which passengers typically carry luggage Against giving seniors, veterans and the disabled a $250 check to offset the lack of a cost of living adjustment in 2010 benefits For streamlining 15 financial literacy programs in 13 departments For tort reform as part of the health care reform law Warner campaigned for office in 2008 as a "radical centrist" who would seek bipartisan compromise. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman this year, said Gillespie’s efforts to define the senator by vote comparisons "is distorting Senator Warner’s moderate record." Turner sent us links to other vote studies and news articles that praise Warner for his bipartisan work. For example, the National Journal rated Warner the 46th most liberal member of the 100-seat U.S. Senate in 2013, based on an analysis of 117 roll call votes on key economic, foreign and social issues. And Open Congress, found that Warner voted with the majority of his party on 90 percent of all Senate bills last year, ranking him 42nd among the 51 Democratic senators. Turner also noted that Warner and Reid disagreed on some matters that the Senate never voted on. Warner, for example, drew national attention for leading an informal, bipartisan group of six senators seeking tax and spending compromises that would lower the national debt. Reid dismissed the effort as "happy talk." He left Warner off a bipartisan supercommitee that unsuccessfully searched for fiscal compromises to avoid automatic spending cuts -- also known as sequestration -- that went into effect last year. Turner also sent us a recent Politico article that named Warner as one of a group of Democratic senators who has been pushing Reid to ease his control of the Senate by allowing more votes on bills and opening up the amendment process. Our ruling Gillespie accused Warner of supporting Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid "down the line." Gillespie’s campaign declined to provide any explanation of the statement. Records show that Warner and Reid have voted in accord 87 percent of the time, including on most of the landmark bills since 2009. That shows substantial agreement, but not the knee-jerk support for Reid that Gillespie suggests. Among the 51 Senate Democrats, Warner has the ninth lowest voting percentage with Reid. Reid and Warner usually agree, but they’re not clones. We rate Gillespie’s exaggerated statement Half True.

pomt-06745	"The United States death rate is two-and-a-half times higher for those who do not have a high school education."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/26/regina-benjamin/us-surgeon-general-says-less-education-means-highe/	School is back in session. Having trouble persuading Junior to go to class? Tell him that if he doesn’t graduate high school, he’s more likely to die. U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin said as much during an interview on WABE-FM (90.1), as she talked about what she said was the close link between education and health. "The United States death rate is two-and-a-half times higher for those who do not have a high school education," Benjamin said. PolitiFact Georgia’s team of reporters was skeptical. Doesn’t that sound like something your mom would say to scare you into behaving? Like, "if you keep making that face, it’ll stick that way"? We called up the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Surgeon General’s Office. Their officials replied with a pile of information. Chief among them was a 2007 report from the National Vital Statistics System, a collection of public health data overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It calculated death rates based on 2004 statistics. According to this data, the gap was even worse than Benjamin said. People ages 25 through 64 with 13 or more years of education died at the rate of 208.3 per 100,000. The rate for those with fewer than 12 years of education was 667.2, or 3.2 times higher. University of Colorado at Boulder professor Richard Rogers pointed us to a NVSS report released in 2010 that says Benjamin is closer to the mark. Data from 2007 shows the death rate for those with less than a high school diploma is 529.5, or 2.7 times the rate for those with at least some college, it said. PolitiFact Georgia also consulted with experts and read studies on the subject. They agreed that Benjamin is correct. Since the 1970s, researchers have been aware that education is closely linked to health. In fact, much of the increase in life expectancy has taken place among high-education groups. Life expectancy actually declined for less-educated white women. According to a 2008 study, better-educated black men can expect to live more than eight years longer than their less-educated counterparts. It’s not entirely clear why people with more education tend to live longer lives. Researchers we interviewed said there are likely many reasons. Those with at least some college are less likely to smoke, be obese, live in dangerous places, or have a host of other characteristics that can shorten their lives, studies show. They have healthier behaviors in part because they have more financial and social resources. Recent evidence also suggests that cognitive ability helps people make better health decisions, said Adriana Lleras-Muney, a University of California Los Angeles professor who has worked on the problem for about a decade. So parents, go ahead. Scare your children into going to school. You won’t be lying. Benjamin earns a True.	None	Regina Benjamin	None	None	None	2011-08-26T06:00:00	2011-08-18	['United_States']
pomt-09426	"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week that the Democrats have to pass their terrible health care bill so that the American people can actually find out what's in it."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/15/republican-party-texas/texas-gop-says-speaker-nancy-pelosi-said-people-wi/	The Republican Party of Texas marveled — not in a good way — at an admission of sorts by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the long-stalled health care overhaul before Congress. According to an e-mail the GOP sent Friday, Pelosi said “the Democrats have to pass their terrible health care bill so that the American people can actually find out what's in it.” Talk about a banana-peel moment. Did Pelosi improbably denigrate her party’s promised legislation and say people can find out what’s in it after it passes? GOP spokesman Bryan Preston pointed us to the text of Pelosi’s March 9 speech in Washington to the National Association of Counties. We learned, for starters, that while the Texas GOP thinks the legislation is terrible, Pelosi clearly doesn't. Instead, Pelosi's remarks celebrate aspects such as a ban on denying health coverage because of a pre-existing conditions, “robust support for public health infrastructure,” more spending on community health centers and reductions in uncompensated care by hospitals. Pelosi also says in the speech that the plan won't require anyone to pay a deductible for preventive health care doctor visits. She summarizes: “It’s going to be very, very exciting.” Yet there’s heft to the GOP's claim that Pelosi said the legislation has to pass so people can find out what’s in it. Pelosi adds: “But we have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of controversy.” Pelosi's words stirred critics from the right including Marguerite Higgins, a senior editorial services associate at The Heritage Foundation. In a blog, Higgins named the moment the video of the week and called Pelosi’s statement a “stunning demonstration of political condescension.” Separately, Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly offered this interpretation of Pelosi's comment: "She meant there was so much talk about process (in Congress) that people have lost sight of what’s actually in the bill. Once it’s passed, we can remind them of all the good things that are in it." Capital fusses aside, we wondered if Pelosi spoke accurately; will the plan need to pass before people know what's in it? We called the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation, which has posted side-by-side comparisons online of health care plans approved by the House and Senate. Its spokesman, Craig Palosky, reminded us that Congress posts the entire legislation online. Of course, that's not to say the final deal is settled — or, it stands to reason, open to public view. Palosky declined to comment precisely on Pelosi's forecast, saying her comment seemed more about politics than policy. "It’s not our role to police such comments," he said. "If you want to know what members of Congress are doing, you have to speak to members of Congress.” His nudge led us to call U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, among a handful of physicians in Congress and an opponent to the Democrats' proposal. Burgess told us it's often true that the ins and outs of legislation aren't widely known until after a measure passes into law; that held true, for instance, for the Republican-steered measure providing government aid toward prescription drugs for seniors. Pelosi's "right," Burgess said, though "I don’t think that’s a good strategy (to declare as much). I wouldn’t recommend anyone actually broadcasting that." So how does the GOP's statement shake out? The party's e-mail errs when it makes it sound as if Pelosi thinks the health-care measure is terrible. It's very much the opposite. But it accurately quotes Pelosi as saying people will find out what's in the plan after it passes. We rate the statement as Mostly True.

pomt-02120	There is no "incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing (vehicular) fatalities."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/may/12/matt-caldwell/there-no-incontrovertible-proof-speed-and-itself-i/	As the Florida legislature neared the finish line this spring, some legislators were in a hurry to increase the speed limit on major highways to 75 mph. But there was plenty of debate about whether the state should put on the brakes. SB 392 cleared the Senate, but the House was split during its April 30 debate, with many arguing that the bill was moving too fast. House sponsor Rep. Matt Caldwell, R-Lehigh Acres, waved off opponents, disputing concerns that the higher speed posed a danger. (The legislation eventually passed 58-56.) "I have yet to see any incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing fatalities," he said. We wondered: Is speed alone a factor in higher car crash fatalities? Let’s take this claim for a test drive. Pedal to the metal The first thing to note about the legislation is that it doesn’t decree an increase in the current 70 mph limit. Rather, Caldwell said, it allows the Florida Department of Transportation the ability to raise limits as high as 75 if they deem that advisable under the right conditions. So how do engineers determine the proper speed limit? They use something called the 85th percentile rule, a widely accepted formula that dictates the safest speed is the one at which 85 percent of drivers travel. (You can read more about the 85th percentile rule here.) Caldwell said that considering the speeds at which most Floridians travel, and given normal conditions (sunny, dry roads, etc.), 75 was an acceptable limit. And he argued that raising the speed alone was not going to increase fatalities. "There’s certainly a huge correlation between speed and accidents," he told PolitiFact Florida. "The real question is whether that’s the real cause of accidents." Factoring in more factors We checked with the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration and the Florida Department of Highway Safety, which both referred us to the Florida Highway Patrol, since they’re the ones who would have to deal with future increases in state speed limits. Public affairs officer Steve Gaskins said the FHP had reached out to other states that increased their speed limits and didn’t find a dramatic impact impact on the number of fatal crashes. Gaskins said there were three other factors that caused crashes: -- Impairment (drunken or drugged driving) -- Distraction (texting, talking, putting on makeup, etc.) -- Aggressiveness (swerving, road rage and so on) Russ Rader, the vice president of communications of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said it was wrong to discount the effects of speed on a crash. He pointed specifically to a 2002 study that said 23 states that raised limits to 70 or 75 mph ended up with 35 and 38 percent more deaths per million vehicle miles traveled, respectively. But Rader acknowledged while speed is a problem, it’s not usually the only problem in fatal accidents. "Crashes rarely have a solo cause. But higher speeds exacerbate other factors," he said. "It’s clear from decades of research that when speed limits go up, crash risk goes up, and the crashes that happen are more likely to be deadly." The Council of State Governments in 2013 noted that while lawmakers and researchers can agree higher speeds cause more deadly accidents because of the physics involved, "Intense debate still surrounds the idea that speed-limit hikes alone make roadways more dangerous." The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported last year that the number of speeding-related deaths through 2011 has been dropping steadily, but maintained a steady 31 or 32 percent of total fatal accidents over several years. Michael Knodler, associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst College of Engineering, agreed that blaming speed increases alone is a difficult way to frame a public safety discussion. "This is certainly something up for debate. If you backed me into a corner I could defend either case," he said. Speed variance is a much more pertinent issue in fatal accidents, he said. If the speed limit is 70 and everyone’s going 90, for example, the difference in the speed among cars is the dangerous factor. Knodler did stop short at Caldwell’s use of "incontrovertible," though, saying the concrete physics of increased speed proves that speed does cause more fatalities in accidents. Those two concerns -- differences in speed and the effects of higher speeds on the severity of accidents -- still don’t mean more fatal accidents will happen, University of Kentucky transportation engineering professor Reginald Souleyrette told PolitiFact Florida. Souleyrette worked on a 2005-10 study of Iowa’s move to increase their speed limit to 70. Initial findings showed there was a slight increase in fatal and serious accidents, but in the long run crash rates went down. "If what the representative implies is true, there should be no speed limit at all. … He is correct if he is implying that we should set ‘appropriate’ speed limits. There is no magic safe speed," Souleyrette said. Our ruling Caldwell said he had "yet to see any incontrovertible proof that speed, in and of itself, is the contributing factor to increasing fatalities." Traffic studies and experts agree that higher speeds can lead to more fatalities in accidents, which makes Caldwell’s use of the word "incontrovertible" suspect. But opinions diverge when discussing whether higher speeds are the cause of those fatal accidents. Speed is no doubt a factor in accidents, but it’s rarely considered the factor leading to fatal crashes. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-06085	"Our income, our GDP per capita, is almost 50 percent higher than (it is for) the average European."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/06/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-income-almost-50-percent-highe/	Recently on the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has used a talking point that favorably compares the United States to Europe. On Dec. 28, 2011, Romney sat down for a a 90-minute conversation with the Quad-City Times editorial board in Iowa. During that session, Romney said that "our income, our GDP per capita, is almost 50 percent higher than (it is for) the average European." Romney said this discrepancy demonstrates the strength of the United States’ system of free enterprise. "I don't want to see a president messing with that," he said, "because it will kill the spirit that makes us the powerhouse we are." (Suggesting that Obama-era America is a danger to free-market capitalism has been a theme for Romney, who has also claimed that "we're inches away from no longer having a free economy" -- a statement we rated Pants on Fire.) A reader asked us to check out the comparison with Europe, so we did. We turned to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that analyzes trends in advanced industrialized countries. One of the statistics the OECD calculates is gross domestic product per capita, measured in constant U.S. dollars and adjusted for the cost of goods in different nations. By this measure, GDP per capita in the U.S. in 2010 was $41,976, compared to $27,533 for the European Union nations. If you compare the two, the U.S. does indeed have a 52 percent higher GDP per capita. So Romney is on solid ground. But there are some caveats worth noting: The European Union vs the Euro Zone. The 27-nation European Union includes a broad range of countries, from wealthy (United Kingdom, France, Sweden) to formerly communist and less-wealthy (Bulgaria, Latvia, Poland and Romania). A tighter group -- and one that includes fewer of the less-wealthy nations, possibly making it a fairer comparison to the U.S. -- consists of the 17 countries that use the Euro. As it happens, the OECD also calculated GDP per capita for the Euro Zone nations and found the average was $29,885. Using this comparison, the U.S. level is just under 44 percent higher. That’s not dramatically different, but it does fall short of 50 percent higher than the European level. Who’s not included. Neither Euro Zone nor the European Union includes two of the richest countries in Europe -- Norway and Switzerland. GDP per capita was $46,908 in Norway -- a level that’s higher than the U.S. -- and $37,775 in Switzerland. If these two countries were added to the calculations, the U.S. advantage would shrink. Holiday and vacation time. By statute, workers in Europe are promised much more vacation and holiday time than workers in the U.S. According to the OECD, workers in 17 European countries work fewer hours than workers in the U.S. Adding holiday and vacation time often means either lower levels of income accumulated from wages, or lower salaries. "If a German gives up some pay to take four more weeks of vacation than an American, he is reported to be poorer, but that may not be the best way to see it," said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that specializes in international economics. GDP per capita vs. median income. This is probably the biggest factor, because a relatively small number of very rich people can skew GDP per capita higher than one would get by comparing median income, which refers to the household that places halfway between the highest- and lowest-income households. Many economists would argue that a fairer measurement of countries would use median income. "If the 300 richest people each see their income rise by an average of $1 billion a year, in per capita terms, this would raise our income by $1,000 a year," said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. "Not many people would feel better as a result of this gain." Data on median incomes is harder to find, but we located some OECD data from the mid 2000s. By our calculation, median income in the United States was only about 33 percent higher than it was for the 22 European OECD members -- $26,990, compared to $20,264. So by this measure, the U.S. is still higher than Europe, but not as dramatically as Romney’s "almost 50 percent" figure would suggest. Our ruling Gross domestic product per capita may not offer the fairest comparison between the U.S. and Europe, mainly because it doesn’t take into account the European trade-off between income and leisure and because it effectively gives heavier weight to a small number of very rich Americans. In addition, there are a number of ways to define "Europe," some of which weaken the accuracy of Romney's statement. Still, as Romney phrased it -- that the United States’ "GDP per capita is almost 50 percent higher than (it is for) the average European" -- his claim has merit. It’s actually slightly over 50 percent by that measure. On balance, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-06T16:44:02	2011-12-28	['Europe']
pomt-14573	Says "some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/feb/08/john-obannon/del-john-obannon-says-planned-parenthood-sold-feta/	Appalled by controversial videos about the extraction of fetal organs for research, Del. John O’Bannon, R-Henrico, recently asked his constituents whether Virginia should take action against Planned Parenthood. "Considering the revelation that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit, do you support or oppose a state investigation into the Planned Parenthood chapters in Virginia?" he asked in an 11-question survey that was mailed to constituents and remains on his website. Planned Parenthood has acknowledged that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to medical researchers and that the one in California has been getting reimbursed. Scientists have used fetal tissue since the 1930s; such experimentation was instrumental in developing the polio vaccine. Current studies are using the tissue to research maladies including AIDS, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson’s. Federal law bars organizations performing abortions from profiting from the sale of fetal tissue. The law does, however, allow them to receive "reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue." O’Bannon’s statement that some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling parts for profit - a claim made by many abortion opponents - is noteworthy because it accuses the organization of illegal acts. So we asked O’Bannon, a neurologist, for proof. He replied in an email: "Considering the videos revealing the activities of Planned Parenthood officials, I’m surprised you’d ask this question. "I urge you to watch the videos, obtained by the Center for Medical Progress, in their entirety here," O’Bannon wrote, with a hyperlink to the group’s website. The Center for Medical Progress is an anti-abortion group that made national headlines last summer when it released secretly recorded videos that it claimed showed Planned Parenthood officials trying to sell aborted fetus tissue for profit. The director of the center, David Daleiden, posed as a representative of a fake biotech company that was seeking to buy fetal tissue for research. He approached officials from several abortion-providing organizations, including Planned Parenthood. The footage contains graphic descriptions of abortion procedures and the methods for salvaging issue, which may be done only with the mother’s advance permission. Some of the conversations occurred over meals, and Planned Parenthood later apologized for the casual attitude displayed by one official in her discussion with Daleiden, who was undercover. One video shows Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, telling Daleiden that he "probably" could obtain tissue for fees ranging from $30 to $100 per specimen. The exact cost, she said, could depend on how much staff time is required to extract the tissue and whether shipping costs were involved. Another video shows Daleiden and an unidentified female colleague - both undercover - meeting with Mary Gatter, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s Medical Directors’ Council. Gatter, after much prodding, said the fee for a tissue specimen might be $50 to $75, but she wasn’t sure and would have to consult with others. "We’re not in it for the money, and we don’t want to be in the position of being accused of selling tissues and stuff like that," Gatter said. "On the other hand, there are costs involved with this." Federal law doesn’t define in dollars and cents the "reasonable payments" abortion clinics may charge for their costs in extracting fetal tissue. Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, has told PolitiFact National that the $30 to $100 range cited by Planned Parenthood officials does "not appear to be out of the ordinary, but no one knows because there is no registry or compendium of fees charged by organizations (or) institutions supplying fetal tissue." The videos have provided new fuel for the efforts of anti-abortion groups to convince Congress and state governments to defund Planned Parenthood. They have prompted separate investigations of the organization in at least 18 states - but not Virginia - and by congressional Republicans. So far, 12 states have concluded their investigations without finding evidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood, according to a Jan. 28 article by National Public Radio.. Perhaps the most significant results came from Washington, one of the two states in which a Planned Parenthood clinic supplied fetal tissue to researchers. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, issued a report in November that concluded the organization did not profit from the activity in his state. Officials in California, the other state where tissue transactions are known to have occurred, have not launched an investigation. Planned Parenthood, seeking to quell the controversy from the videos, announced in October that it no longer would accept reimbursement for fetal tissues. It also should be noted that on Jan. 24, a Texas grand jury cleared Planned Parenthood of wrongdoing and indicted Daleiden on a felony charge of tampering with a government record by fashioning a fake California driver’s license. Sandra Merritt, another center employee who accompanied Daleiden on some of the meetings with Planned Parenthood, was indicted on the same charge. Daleiden also was indicted on a misdemeanor charge related to trying to purchase fetal tissue. Our ruling O’Bannon said "some Planned Parenthood chapters have been selling the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit." As evidence, he points broadly to a series of secretly recorded videos in which anti-abortion advocates - posing undercover as officials of a fake biotech firm seeking to buy fetal tissue for research - met with Planned Parenthood officials. Planned Parenthood acknowledges that one of its clinics in each of two states - Washington and California - supplies fetal tissue to researchers but says they comply with federal law barring a financial profit from the transactions. O’Bannon’s statement implicitly accuses Planned Parenthood of breaking the law, so there’s a burden on him to prove the organization profited from sales. He falls short by simply pointing to the videos in which Planned Parenthood officials, under prodding from the undercover activists, say tissues probably could be obtained for $30 to $100 per sample. A medical ethicist tells us those fees seem to be a "reasonable" reimbursement for the cost of supplying the tissue. An investigation by Washington’s attorney general cleared Planned Parenthood of charges it was profiting from the sales in that state. Investigations in 11 other states also have cleared the organization. There’s simply nothing that proves O’Bannon’s claim and much that contradicts it. So we rate his statement False.

pomt-14197	"Studies have consistently failed to establish the existence of a link between the harshness of a country’s drug laws and its levels of drug use."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/22/kofi-annan/former-un-secretary-general-says-war-drugs-has-fai/	Several Latin American and European countries pressed their case to decriminalize drugs at a special session of the United Nations this week. They came up short. The document that emerged maintained a basic prohibitionist stance. But the advocates for a softer touch did garner some prominent backers, including former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who argued in an op-ed that the war on drugs has failed. "Prohibition has had little impact on the supply of or demand for drugs," Annan wrote. "When law enforcement succeeds in one area, drug production simply moves to another region or country, drug trafficking moves to another route and drug users switch to a different drug. Nor has prohibition significantly reduced use. Studies have consistently failed to establish the existence of a link between the harshness of a country’s drug laws and its levels of drug use." Measuring the effectiveness of prohibitions can be tricky. For this fact-check, we're looking into the connection between getting tough on drugs and less use. We reached out to the Kofi Annan Foundation and did not hear back, so we don’t know what specific studies he had in mind. We reached out to several experts in the field and generally, they agreed with his statement. Jonathan Caulkins, professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, has worked on some of the broadest examinations of drugs in America. Caulkins was part of the team that wrote the U.S. Office of National Drug Policy’s latest assessment of how much users spend on drugs. "There is some research that finds increased harshness reduces use, but the overall statement is true," Caulkins told PolitiFact. "By and large, expanding toughness beyond a basic prohibition plus the usual amount of enforcement does not drive down use." European countries created a natural laboratory of sorts on the interplay of marijuana laws and marijuana use. Over the decades, different countries have adopted a variety of approaches. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction examined the results in each place. The center’s legal analyst Brendan Hughes told us no clear relationship emerged. The following chart shows why. In Italy, for example, penalties went up but so did use. Denmark also tightened its laws and saw almost no change. On the flip side, the United Kingdom adopted lighter sanctions and the prevalence of marijuana fell. But when Slovakia did the same, usage rose. One approach to gauging the impact of enforcement is to track trends in the price of drugs, after factoring in changes in purity. Based on the basic rules of supply and demand, if the price falls, use is expected to rise, and vice versa. The most recent analysis from the U.S. Office of National Drug Policy dates back to 2008. While the numbers could have changed since then, that report had discouraging news for the zero-tolerance camp. The price of heroin had fallen about 30 percent for all grades or purity in 10 years, cocaine showed a modest but steady decline, and some grades of marijuana saw a 50 percent drop in price. (This predates by many years the decriminalization moves in Colorado and Washington State.) Thomas Kerr, Co-Director of the Urban Health Research Initiative at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, said the federal data provide "compelling evidence" of the limits of a get-tough policy. "As expenditures on drug control increased dramatically, use has not gone down, nor has price, while purity has gone up," Kerr said. Kerr pointed to research in Thailand, where simple possession of heroin can lead to up to 10 years in prison, that found harsh enforcement tactics had no apparent impact on heroin users. We did find one study that concluded that greater incarceration reduced drug use. Economist Steven Levitt at the University of Chicago co-authored a 2001 article that examined cocaine patterns between 1980 and 2000. It was a time, Levitt wrote, when the number of prisoners jailed for drug-related offenses rose 15-fold. "We estimate that cocaine prices are 10 to 15 percent higher today as a consequence of increases in drug punishment since 1985," Levitt wrote. "Based on previous estimates of the price elasticity of demand for cocaine, this implies a reduction in cocaine consumed of as much as 20 percent." However, that conclusion hangs on a rising price of cocaine, and data gathered after that report showed prices falling, not rising. That doesn’t mean that cocaine use rose in response. As a sign of the complicated nature of drug consumption, federal data showed that from 2002 to 2010, the amount of cocaine used in the United States fell by half. An article by Caulkins and his colleague Peter Reuter at the RAND Corporation, a prominent think tank, concluded that enforcement can sometimes help stop a mass market from forming, such as in the case of a new drug coming on the scene. But once a drug takes hold, "there may be little return to intense enforcement. A modest level of enforcement may generate most of the benefits from prohibition." Caulkins emphasized that the policy choice is not between a total ban and no ban at all. "If one goes from the basic enforcement necessary to make a prohibition real to no prohibition at all, then use and abuse would go way up," he warned. Our ruling Annan said that studies consistently fail to find a link between the harshness of a country’s drug laws and its levels of drug use. The experts we reached and the data and reports we found largely backed that up. In some places, tougher penalties led to less use. In others, tougher laws had no effect at all. In the United States, while there are shifting patterns of drug use, there is no simple relationship to the severity of the nation’s drug laws. The caveat is that from the European study, relaxing penalties had equally unpredictable results. Annan’s statement needs that bit of context. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57b76f03-26f4-41a0-8a93-f3bfa84ccb0f	None	Kofi Annan	None	None	None	2016-04-22T11:16:09	2016-04-19	['None']
pomt-11904	"Women in our state will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care"	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/oct/21/andrew-cuomo/state-birth-control-rule-doesnt-cover-all-insuranc/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says women in New York state don’t have to worry about new Trump administration rules ending a federal requirement that employers must include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. The new rules exempt employers from the Obama-era mandate if they have religious or moral reservations to the coverage. But Cuomo said contraception will still be covered in New York state. "This year, we ensured that whatever happens at the federal level, women in our state will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care," Cuomo said in a statement. States can set certain insurance standards beyond what the federal government requires. New York state told insurance companies in January they are required to cover birth control and abortion services. That condition still stands, but is Cuomo right that women in New York state are not affected by Trump’s decision? Limits to state regulation State regulations, like the one from January, do not apply to all plans. The state Department of Financial Services regulates everything sold on the state health exchange, called New York State of Health. That includes plans sold to individuals and companies with 100 or fewer employees. The agency says the state’s birth control mandate covers 1.35 million residents in those plans. Health care offered through companies with more than 100 employees is more complicated. Companies that go the traditional route of buying health coverage through an insurance carrier must adhere to the rules. About 2.5 million people in that category are covered by the state’s birth control mandate. But companies that are self-insured, where the employer assumes a large part of the costs, are not regulated by the state, meaning they need not adhere to the state's birth control mandate. About 60 percent of private sector workers in the U.S. who get their health coverage through an employer were enrolled in a self-insured plan in 2015. That’s up from 46 percent in 1996, according to research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. In New York state, about 54 percent of private sector employees who get health insurance through their employer had a self-insured plan last year, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The option is most popular for companies with at least 1,000 employees. Eighty percent of private sector employees at companies that size in New York state are enrolled in a self-insured plan. What about public health insurance? The federal government sets the baseline for what services are covered under Medicaid. Government workers are covered under state regulation, but Medicaid and Medicare enrollees are not.States can add to that list. The list of services covered by Medicaid in New York state goes well beyond the federal standard. New York is one of multiple states where Medicaid covers birth control and abortion services. About a third of the state’s population alone is on Medicaid. Our ruling Cuomo said women in New York state "will continue to have cost-free access to reproductive health care" because of an action the state took earlier this year. But not every woman is in an insurance plan regulated by the state. It’s possible a self-insured large employer in New York state could apply for an exemption from the federal birth control mandate. If granted the exemption, the company would not have to provide health coverage for birth control to its employees. Those exemptions are not expected to be widespread, but they are possible. Cuomo’s statement needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2017-10-21T09:23:12	2017-10-06	['None']
pomt-07535	"Since 1990, in inflation-adjusted dollars, per-student funding of the (Florida) state university system from general revenue has dropped by about $4,000."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/05/bob-graham/column-bob-graham-scolds-legislature-university-fu/	Former Democratic governor and U.S. Sen. Bob Graham is taking to the editorial pages of Florida's newspapers to warn against a slow march by the Republican-dominated Legislature against the state's core values. In an opinion column that appeared in the St. Petersburg Times on April 3, 2011, Graham openly questioned whether the Legislature's decision over the past decade to reduce taxes has produced the high-quality jobs the tax cuts promised, and whether the Legislature is backing away from a commitment to preserve the Florida Everglades. He also took on the Legislature when it comes to how the state funds its university system. In doing so, he provided a claim that piqued our interest. He wrote: "Since 1990, in inflation-adjusted dollars, per-student funding of the state university system from general revenue has dropped by about $4,000," Graham wrote. "These savage cuts to education expose a lack of vision for Florida's future." We've heard Graham talk about the Legislature and the state university system before. In 2007, he sued the Legislature, arguing that it did not have the authority to set tuition rates. That power, he said, is left up to the Board of Governors. A circuit court judge last year ruled against Graham, who said he will appeal. In this case, Graham is talking about the money the Legislature sets aside in general revenues -- mostly from sales tax proceeds -- to fund the university system. Graham's numbers actually came from the Board of Governors, the statewide governing body for the university system that was created by the passage of a constitutional amendment in 2002. Kelly Layman, a spokeswoman for the Board of Governors and university system Chancellor Frank Brogan, provided PolitiFact Florida the same spreadsheet it provided Graham when he requested it. The spreadsheet details university funding from the 1990-91 budget -- Republican Bob Martinez's last budget as governor -- to the current 2010-11 budget. The big takeaway? The vast majority of dollar-for-dollar increases into the university system are overwhelming the result of increases to student tuition. In 1990, general tax revenues funded 71 percent of per-student costs while tuition covered 18 percent. In 2010, taxes funded 49 percent of per-student costs. Tuition covered 40 percent. In bottom line numbers, taxes funded $5,131 a student in 1990 compared to $5,682 in the current budget. Using the U.S. Department of Labor's online inflation calculator, $5,131 in 1990 dollars is worth $8,688 today. That's $3,006 less. Short of the "about $4,000" Graham claimed. We reached Graham to ask him about the difference. Graham told us he calculated the figure a slightly different way. He took the 1990 allocation -- $5,131 -- and popped it into a compound interest calculator like this one. He factored in 3 percent annual interest growth, and calculated out for 21 years -- 1990 to 2011. The result? $9,626.45. He then subtracted $5,682 (the current funding) to get an inflation-adjusted spending reduction of $3,944.45. "We should be investing in our students and our universities, and instead we're not," Graham said. It's worth noting that the amount of tax dollars funding the university system didn't fall off a cliff in 1990. In fact, after a decrease in 1991, spending increased. In 1998, tax dollars contributed $6,950 per student ($9,400 in today's dollars when adjusted for inflation). Dollars slowly melted away after that, or if the Legislature approved funding increases, they failed to keep up with the cost of inflation. As late as 2007, the Legislature directed $7,685 in tax dollars to the university system, which translates to about $8,200 when adjusted for inflation. Graham said that "since 1990, in inflation-adjusted dollars, per-student funding of the state university system from general revenue has dropped by about $4,000." He used a compound interest calculator to come to that figure, but that assumes inflation from 1990-2011 averaged 3 percent per year. According to the Department of Labor, the economy did not grow quite at that rate -- hence the disparity between Graham's calculation and ours. That said, he's right that tax dollars are not funding the state university system the way it did two decades ago. So we rate Graham's statement Mostly True.

pomt-13821	"In North Carolina, paid family leave is more popular than college basketball."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/15/moms-rising/paid-family-leave-more-popular-college-basketball-/	Like many in North Carolina, we’re excited for the start of college basketball season four months from now. But in the meantime, we decided to take a break from more serious fact checks about the economy and HB2 to take a look at a political claim talking about – you guessed it – college basketball. The liberal advocacy group MomsRising was talking a big game on Twitter recently, pushing for paid family leave policies. They said the idea that businesses should pay workers when they have to miss work for major family events – the birth of a child, taking care of an ill relative, etc. – is more popular than the unofficial religion of the Tar Heel state. "In North Carolina, paid family leave is more popular than college basketball," the group declared, alongside a photo from a UNC-Duke game. That’s a high bar to clear in a state that has sent a team to five of the last 12 men’s college basketball national championship games. So we wondered if it’s true, or the political equivalent of claiming Christian Laettner is a beloved figure in Kentucky. "There’s nothing more North Carolina than basketball," said Beth Messersmith, the N.C. campaign director for MomsRising who came up with the basketball analogy. "If you can be more popular than basketball in North Carolina, then you know you’re onto something." Support for college basketball First things first. Just how popular is college basketball in North Carolina? Some alumni of UNC, Duke, Wake Forest and N.C. State may be surprised to learn that not all North Carolinians are crazy for college hoops. According to a poll taken just before last season by Public Policy Polling, 52 percent of North Carolinians consider themselves college basketball fans. In another PPP poll commissioned in early July by MomsRising and other groups that mostly focused on paid leave – the same poll their Twitter claim referenced – college basketball received 53 percent support. Yet even just two years prior, in 2013, 59 percent of North Carolina respondents told PPP they were college basketball fans. Other polls have documented the sport’s declining popularity nationwide. Gallup, for instance, found that while the number of fans didn’t drop between 2001 and 2012, the number of people saying they were definitely not fans (as opposed to on the fence) has grown. And according to the Harris Poll, college basketball was perhaps at its height in 1989, when 10 percent of Americans said it was their favorite sport. In 2015, that number was 4 percent. Time Magazine analyzed the sport’s declining popularity last year and attributed it to a number of factors, including low scoring, conference realignment that ended some popular rivalries, and a schedule that forces it to compete for attention with both college and professional football. Support for paid leave Let’s now take a break to watch some of our favorite college basketball moments, then get back to the subject at hand: paid leave policies. According to one United Nations study of 170 countries, only the U.S. and the tiny Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea don’t require paid family leave. PolitiFact has previously checked several people claiming the U.S. is lagging behind the rest of the world in its paid leave policies; it was particularly popular with Bernie Sanders during his run for the Democratic presidential nomination. It could be expensive. PolitiFact’s "Obameter," which tracks promises made by the president, noted that he has failed in his promise to spend $1.5 billion to start paid family and medical leave in the United States. In North Carolina, the poll from Public Policy Polling that MomsRising commissioned found 49 percent of people strongly favor paid family leave and another 19 percent somewhat favor it, for a total of 68 percent support. To jog your memory, college basketball has recently been polling about 15 percentage points lower than that. We don’t know the partisan breakdown of this poll, but in national polls, paid leave typically has bipartisan support – although moreso among liberals – and among politicians, it’s far more popular among Democrats than Republicans. Because of that, it’s worth noting that the poll in question was paid for by a liberal group pushing for more paid leave policies, and that Public Policy Polling is itself a liberal-leaning organization. So take these numbers with a grain of salt. But unfortunately, there has been little to no other statewide polling on the topic. Public Policy Polling – which does polls for private clients as well as for public distribution – has never before asked about paid family leave in a public poll. Similarly, we weren’t able to find any other statewide polling on the subject (although if you know of any, please let us know). But nationally, the polling does mirror what PPP found in North Carolina. In 2015, an AP-GfK poll found two-thirds of Americans supported paid family leave – about the same as the recent North Carolina poll, but lacking the political biases, and an AP-NORC poll two months ago found 75 percent support among people age 40 and older. A New York Times-CBS poll, in 2015, found 80 percent support for paid family leave nationally. Our ruling MomsRising said that "paid family leave is more popular than college basketball" in North Carolina. There is little polling on this topic at the state level, but what there is does line up with national polling. Since data is sparse but does support the claim, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0963b149-97d8-405c-b3e4-2bc010444fab	None	Moms Rising	None	None	None	2016-07-15T10:45:37	2016-07-13	['North_Carolina']
pomt-04176	Wisconsin has created "just under 100,000" jobs since he took office.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/16/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsin-has-created-almost/	Gov. Scott Walker’s top campaign promise was that the state would create 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his four-year term. Walker has made the vow in a variety of forums, including speeches, videos, and on his campaign and official websites. But the state’s progress in job creation was last in the nation in 2011 -- and there have been no signs of a significant turnaround in 2012. During the 2012 recall election, Walker touted about 33,000 new jobs. So, where did a figure of nearly 100,000 come from? That’s the number Walker cited Dec. 12, 2012 in response to questions at a workforce development event in Pewaukee, when he said he thought he still could reach 250,000. "We're just under 100,000" jobs, he said. "It's going to be tough, no doubt about it." And he added: "We're going to achieve it." A few hours later at an event in Madison, Walker gave a more precise figure when asked about progress on the 250,000 jobs promise. He said the number of jobs created was just over 86,000: "We're not there yet, but we're moving at a much better pace than most people think." When we asked about the "just under 100,000 figure," Walker spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster said the number was based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, considered the most reliable measure of employment. She said the data showed there were 86,490 jobs created from December 2010 (just before Walker took office) to June 2012 (the most recent quarter available). "There was a question, and the number he gave is based on that QCEW raw data," Webster said. Webster said she had no further explanation for the number other than to say it came from the state Department of Workforce Development. "Part of it was that it was the number that the governor had been told," she said. "That is where it came from." At PolitiFact, we’ve been down this path. And down this math. For our monthly update of Walker’s progress, we wanted to use the most accurate data possible. That would be the census data which comes from a quarterly survey of 95 percent of the state’s employers. There also are monthly numbers from a much smaller sample that are less accurate. The end of the year census data for 2011 showed a net increase of 27,811 jobs. When the first quarter census data came out for 2012, we thought about adding those numbers to the 2011 figure and create a running total. But we were warned against it. By whom? A state Department of Revenue Economist and officials with the governor’s office and the Department of Workforce Development. They said it was inaccurate to view the census data in anything other than one-year blocks. In other words, you can’t combine partial years of census data with full years to create a running total. "Please don’t, as John Koskinen, an economist at DOR would say, compare February temperatures to July," said Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie when we asked about job numbers last summer. When we talked to Koskinen, here’s what he said: "The QCEW data published by DWD, and maintained by the BLS (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), is not seasonally adjusted. The seasonal pattern overwhelms any trend, so a direct comparison between December 2010 and March 2012 is not valid. The only valid comparison between December 2010 and March 2012 would be with data that is seasonally adjusted." Werwie also noted the seasonally adjusted issue, and said if we combined the yearly and quarterly data "you’ll end up misrepresenting the truth." DWD has followed this approach when it has released quarterly jobs data this year. For instance, on Nov. 15, 2012 the department issued a report based on the census data, but limited it to the 12 months between June 2011 and June 2012. That report said the state created 35,379 jobs in that time frame. The department did the same thing Aug. 16, 2012 when it released census data comparing March 2011 with March 2012, showing a gain of 37,464 jobs in that period. To be sure, Walker has maintained a love-hate relationship with the jobs data over the course of his two years in office. Much of that has been directed at the monthly Current Employment Survey data, which is far less accurate and prone to revisions. Early on, Walker celebrated monthly increases with news conferences. And when the monthly numbers have declined, members of his administration have criticized the figures as being sloppy. After talking with state officials, including Koskinen, and other experts, we came up with our own formula for measuring the jobs progress on the Walk-O-Meter. We take the full year of jobs as measured by the census numbers -- 27,811 -- and add to that the running monthly tallies for 2012. It’s an estimate, but, all outside experts agreed, the best available given the limitations of the data. Using this formula, we determined that as of the Nov. 15, 2012 monthly report, which covered October 2012, the state created 25,411 private sector jobs under Walker’s watch. We emailed Koskinen and DWD officials to ask for their take on Walker’s use of the census data. No one got back to us with a response. We later heard again from Webster, who said Walker was simply providing the latest "raw data" as "a snapshot with no assumptions." However, the governor included no such qualifications when he made the remarks. Webster also noted "six quarters of economic activity obviously cannot be used to accurately project two full years of job activity." Our rating Walker said the state has created "just under 100,000" jobs since he took office. He arrived at that number by combining full and partial years of census data. However, several within his own administration, including his primary spokesman, have said that is the wrong way to measure jobs -- you can’t combine partial and full year data sets. As one aide said: It would be "misrepresenting the truth." By his administration’s own yardstick, his statement is false. We think it’s ridiculous to -- after private admonitions -- publicly present it this way. Pants on Fire.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-12-16T09:00:00	2012-12-12	['None']
pomt-07107	"The right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today than the heavily unionized states."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/21/newt-gingrich/numbers-back-gingrich-job-growth-claim/	Former Georgia congressman Newt Gingrich made a claim during last week’s CNN debate of Republican presidential candidates that was like red meat to conservatives who complain that government is trying to force employees to join unions. "The right-to-work states are creating a lot more jobs today than the heavily unionized states," said Gingrich, the former U.S. House Speaker who now lives in Virginia. Is that true? We wanted to check. First, let’s explain what is a right-to-work state. In right-to-work states, employees can decide whether or not they want to join or financially support a union. There are 22 states, including Georgia, with right-to-work laws. Most of those states are in the South, the Plains region and parts of the West. The right-to-work issue became a political thunderstorm earlier this year when some Republican leaders in Wisconsin wanted to strip bargaining rights from public-sector union workers and pass legislation to make it a right-to-work state. Many Republican leaders across the country complain it’s more difficult for the economy to flourish in strong union states. Gingrich is part of the right-to-work crowd. A campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, suggested we go back a decade to examine his claim. The "historical trend is overwhelming," Hammond told us in an e-mail. Gingrich’s argument is apparently rooted in data from the National Institute for Labor Relations Research. Between 1999 to 2009, it found job growth rose in right-to-work states by 3.7 percent and fell in "forced-unionism states" by 2.8 percent. The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation conducted similar research from 2000 to 2010 in the 22 right-to-work states and found there was a less than 1 percent increase in private-sector job growth and a 5.5 percent decline in the other 28 states. Foundation official Stanley Greer stressed to us that they don’t believe right-to-work guidelines are the sole factor for private-sector job growth, but still are a "very important factor." The Economic Policy Institute, an organization that says its goal is to raise the economic status of low- and middle-income Americans, argues that right-to-work laws "have not succeeded in boosting employment growth in the states that have adopted them," according to a March report. Two researchers there attributed the job growth in many right-to-work states, particularly the South, to factors that include interstate road improvements and more money spent on education. All three organizations used the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics for their research. So did we. PolitiFact Georgia compared the number of private-sector jobs in each state from April 2001 to April 2011, the most recent month available. We found 15 of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. North Dakota, which Gingrich hailed during the CNN debate, had the largest increase during that time span, 19.5 percent. The four states with the greatest decrease were all Rust Belt states that have relied on manufacturing: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. None of those are right-to-work states. Georgia had the fifth lowest private sector job growth rate. We also analyzed private-sector job growth since June 2009, which federal officials said was the end of the recent economic recession. North Dakota, again, was at the head of the class and Texas, another right-to-work state, was second. Thirteen of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. Four of the five states with the lowest private-sector job growth rates were not right-to-work states. Overall, there was a slight increase in the number of private-sector jobs in the 22 right-to-work states during the past decade and post recession. In the 28 other states, there was a small decrease in both time periods. Nine of the nation’s 10 fastest-growing states over the past decade were right-to-work states. Five of those states -- Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Texas and Utah -- had increases in job growth since April 2001. The population growth in those states may be a factor. By our analysis, Gingrich’s statement that job growth is higher in right-to-work states has merit. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a5a749c3-e5a8-498a-8c86-1990581abcea	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-06-21T06:00:00	2011-06-13	['None']
pomt-00369	Says Andrew Gillum "wants to abolish ICE and doesn't believe in doing any type of immigration enforcement."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/sep/11/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-claims-andrew-gillum-wants-abolish-ic/	In his quest to become Florida’s next governor, Republican Ron DeSantis has embraced President Donald Trump’s rhetoric against illegal immigration. He’s also labeled his Democratic opponent Andrew Gillum as someone who doesn’t care about enforcing immigration laws. "He wants to abolish ICE and doesn't believe in doing any type of immigration enforcement," DeSantis said of Gillum during a Sept. 2 interview with New York radio host John Catsimatidis. (ICE is the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency in charge of executing immigration laws within the United States.) Gillum has called for abolishing ICE but has also said that ICE needs to be "replaced with a more compassionate and focused agency" focused on immigration issues. DeSantis resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives on Sept. 10 to focus on his campaign. Election Day is Nov. 6. Gillum’s call to abolish ICE Gillum, Tallahassee’s mayor, is among Democrats who have criticized ICE since media reports said newly arriving immigrant families were being separated at the border. This summer, the Trump administration employed a "zero-tolerance" policy to refer for prosecution all immigrants who enter the United States illegally. That resulted in more than 2,000 children being separated from their parents. The government has since reunified most of them due to a court order, but hundreds of children remain without their parents. "It's time to abolish ICE in its current form to be replaced with a more compassionate and focused agency that actually keeps us safer," Gillum posted on Facebook on July 3. "Donald Trump has turned ICE into a police and child separation agency — not a border enforcement agency that treats people humanely and compassionately." Gillum’s claim that Trump turned ICE from being a "border enforcement agency" is flawed, because ICE doesn’t enforce laws at the border. The agency that does that is U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP. What’s ICE’s role? ICE agents pick up people already living in the United States illegally. A division of ICE also investigates and arrests people involved in gangs and human trafficking. ICE also oversees detention facilities that house people waiting a resolution of their immigration case or waiting to be deported. Some Democrats in Congress calling for the abolition of ICE have muddled the distinction between the two agencies. Republicans have done so, too; claiming that getting rid of ICE equals a call for open borders. Overall, there isn’t a unified Democratic message behind the "abolish ICE" movement. For some, it means a restructuring of the agency, a new focus, or shifting responsibilities to other agencies. Others want to see ICE shuttered and a new agency rise in its place. Generally, however, they aren’t calling for end to immigration enforcement. "We want to replace ICE with the Department of Justice, an entity that has not been tarnished in the same way as ICE has," Gillum said during an Aug. 29 CNN interview after winning the Democratic primary. In his July Facebook post, Gillum wrote that "a decision between security or compassionate immigration policy is a false choice," and promised to fight for both as governor. DeSantis’s argument that Gillum doesn't believe in immigration enforcement What’s DeSantis’s evidence that Gillum doesn't believe in any type of immigration enforcement? He cites instances when Gillum spoke in favor of immigrants (including ones here illegally) and against measures that he believes would discriminate or criminalize them. But Gillum hasn’t said no laws should be enforced. Gillum is against requiring that Florida employers use what’s now a voluntary program called E-Verify. That program checks a person’s identity and employment eligibility by electronically matching his or her information to federal databases, including immigration records. Gillum has said that requiring E-Verify "criminalizes people's personhood." (Some employers with federal contracts are required to enroll in E-Verify.) Gillum also opposes "mass deportations" and believes immigration enforcement should remain a federal matter. He criticized Trump for threatening to cut federal funds from cities that limit their cooperation with federal agents. Trump calls those places "sanctuary cities." Gillum told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that as governor he would "promote mutual trust and cooperation between law enforcement and immigrant communities, regardless of immigration status." Our ruling DeSantis said Gillum, "wants to abolish ICE and doesn't believe in doing any type of immigration enforcement." Gillum said "it's time to abolish ICE," joining some Democrats making similar calls after reports of family separations at the border. However, Gillum also said ICE needed to be replaced with a more "focused agency." He hasn’t advocated against the enforcement of all immigration laws. DeSantis’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-05344	"When these [undocumented] students graduate from college, they're still illegal aliens. They cannot get a job."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/13/terry-gorman/immigration-enforcement-advocate-terry-gorman-says/	As a result of a decision last year by the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, students who are in the state illegally who graduate from Rhode Island high schools are eligible for the in-state tuition rate if they decide to go to a state college or university. The ruling sparked a furor among advocates of strict enforcement of immigration laws. Two bills -- one that would reverse the board’s decision and one that would make the policy state law -- were the subject of an April 24, 2012, hearing before the House Committee on Finance. William T. "Terry" Gorman, executive director of Rhode Islanders for Immigration Law Enforcement, argued for reversing the regents’ policy, saying the state would be subsidizing a college education for people who aren't employable because they are in the country illegally. "Please keep in mind that these students, when they're attending high school, they're illegal aliens. When they graduate, they're illegal aliens. When they enter college, they're illegal aliens. Because of that status, they're not allowed to get a job to help pay their way through college. They're not allowed to get a driver's license to drive back and forth to college. And when we've provided them that four years of in-state tuition, they're not allowed to get a job," Gorman said. "They can't get a job at Textron, they can't get a job at CVS, they can't get a job at Gilbane, they can't get a job at Dunkin’ Donuts, and they can't get a job at Burger King because of their status. And we provided them with four years of a college education." He again emphasized that point later in the hearing: "When these students graduate from college, they're still illegal aliens. They cannot get a job. How does that help the economy?" One could argue that it's good to have the state's smartest students -- whether legal or illegal -- move into the Rhode Island work force. But will those undocumented college grads really end up unemployed anyway? We were particularly curious because three of the 12 states that have passed laws to provide in-state tuition for undocumented high school graduates -- California, New Mexico and Texas -- are places where the illegal immigration issue is particularly prominent, thanks to their borders with Mexico. Are those states doing something different, allowing companies to tap the best-educated, motivated undocumented residents? The answer is no, said Laura Vazquez, a legislative analyst for the National Council of La Raza, a Washington, D.C.-based Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. She said the situation is the same throughout the United States. "When they graduate, we don't get the benefit of having this educated group of people who are eager and ready to contribute fully." They do find work. "Some of them are working under the table" under poor conditions. Some work for family. A number of students go to law school or enroll in Ph.D. programs, she said. But companies can't hire them because the government requires that all workers be checked for employment eligibility. Graduates could seek employment overseas, but "a lot of these kids feel American through and through and want to practice their skills here," Vazquez said. And if they were to leave the country to take an overseas job they won't be allowed back in for a long time. Immigration law says, in general, if you've been in the United States illegally for more than one year after reaching age 18, once you leave the country you are banned from reentering for 10 years. In a few cases, undocumented people who have been scheduled for deportation have gotten a waiver from the Department of Homeland Security, which allows them to seek a work permit. But the DHS "is very stingy with it," she said. Other immigration experts told us the same thing: Gorman is essentially correct. "It is true that undocumented college graduates are legally barred from working. The only exception is in rare cases they have been able to obtain contract work provided there is no employer/employee relationship," said Kent Wong, director of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Los Angeles. Gorman sent us a link to a Huffington Post story about Iliana Guadalupe Perez, a mathematician and undocumented immigrant, who has written a free online guide detailing how undocumented college graduates can find work. Her advice was also to seek work as an independent contractor where proof of citizenship isn't required. When we asked Gorman what was going on in the border states, he suggested that graduates may be able to get jobs because enforcement was lax. He said a source in San Diego reported that immigration officials "are not checking on hardly anything regarding illegal aliens here right now, least of all the status of recent college grads applying for jobs. She said the governor just authorized state scholarships for the illegal alien students. "I also spoke with Jim Gilchrist from the Minuteman Project and he echoed basically the same sentiments. He did say there has been more employer audits by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] but not of the type that would be looking for illegal alien college grads," Gorman said in an e-mail. (The Minuteman Project pushes for stronger enforcement of immigration laws.) "I also spoke with the Policy Director of The Center for Immigration Studies and she said she has never heard of any enforcement efforts in Texas or California regarding illegal alien college grads," said Gorman. The center is a research group that opposes illegal immigration and wants less legal immigration into the United States. However, given the strictness of the law, a special effort to focus on college graduates may not be necessary. Michael Olivas, director of the Institute of Higher Education Law & Governance at the University of Houston, said the why-give-them-a-tuition-break-when-they-can't-get-a-job argument is a diversion from the real problem: children brought to the United States, sometimes at a very young age, "are left in this netherworld where they can neither work nor be licensed" once they become adults. And when their inability to find work is used to try to prevent them from being eligible for the same in-state educational opportunities as their peers, "it’s the worst kind of misdirection. It's hiding the larger issue," said Olivas, a proponent of the federal DREAM Act, which would give such students a path to citizenship. Our ruling Terry Gorman, during testimony on the question of whether to let Rhode Island's undocumented high school graduates take advantage of in-state tuition rates, said, "When these students graduate from college, they're still illegal aliens. They cannot get a job." The experts we spoke with said he's generally correct, although they can, in a few cases, be hired as independent contractors. Over all, we rate the claim as True.

pomt-01061	We've seen "our deficits cut by two-thirds."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-deficit-has-decreased-two-thir/	When President Barack Obama reflects on 2014, he brings up a litany of highlights that include drawing down the Afghanistan war and Americans signing up for health insurance thanks to his health care law. Oh, and slicing up the deficit. Obama is super-pumped about that. He made a point to brag about the deficit's drop in his 2015 State of the Union address. "At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits," Obama said. "Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years." Is he right about the deficit dropping by two-thirds? What the White House says As a reminder, don’t get the deficit twisted with the debt. They are only related, not the same. The country’s annual deficit is the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The national debt, which exceeds $18 trillion, is the net of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. To back up his claim, Obama is comparing his first budget year in office -- 2009 -- to 2014. The White House is breaking down the deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and not actual dollars. Economists told us this is a valid way of analyzing the deficit, because it factors in the economy’s change over time. The White House sent us this chart, which relies on data from the White House Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2009, which started almost four months before Obama's presidency began and ended eight months into it, the deficit was 9.8 percent of GDP. The 2014 shortfall is 2.8 percent of GDP -- a decrease of 71 percent. So that's where the claim comes from. The situation largely tracks if you use real dollars. Using the same comparison with Congressional Budget Office figures, the deficit fell from $1.4 trillion in the 2009 fiscal year to $486 billion in the 2014 fiscal year -- a drop of about 66 percent. Why the drop might not be so exciting Experts told us that while Obama's math may be correct, it's missing some important caveats. First, it's important to note that the deficit swelled in 2009 (hence the steady drop). In 2008, the deficit was $458 billion, or 3.1 percent of GDP. Those deficits are smaller than the ones the country is facing today. The 2009 fiscal year represented a huge jump in the deficit, partly because of the massive stimulus program to jumpstart the cratering economy. "This is not to say that that large deficit was his fault, but if one used the 2008 deficit as a frame of reference, the comparison would be quite different," said Alan Auerbach, University of California Berkeley professor of economics and law. Also, some economists we consulted pointed out that the 2009 fiscal year was Obama’s first year in office, and so not necessarily a good starting point since he had little control over the spending in that year. And there's another issue. Princeton University economics professor Harvey Rosen said the more important question is if Obama has put the government on a path that will keep deficits stable. "And the answer is no," Rosen said, because entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, have not had substantial reform. The long-term forecast for the deficit illustrates this point. Absent substantial reform, the Congressional Budget Office expects a few more years of short-term deficit decreases followed by bigger shortfalls in 10 and 20 years. Federal spending is projected to increase through 2039, so much so that by then the federal debt held by the public will reach a point only seen after World War II. The deficit would be equal to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2029 and 6.5 percent of GDP by 2039, a higher deficit than any year between 1947 and 2008. This chart from the Congressional Budget Office shows how the deficit is not expected to continue its downward trend in recent years. A final word on Obama’s point from the experts. The deficit has come down in recent years because of the strengthening economy, which drives tax revenues up, and the draw-down of various economic stimulus programs that were implemented to weather the financial crisis. Additionally, the expiration of 2 percent payroll tax cuts and increases in tax rates for high-income earners played a role, albeit a smaller one. "It’s not clear one would want to view the evolution as relating to fiscal responsibility rather than an improving economy," Auerbach said. Our ruling Obama said since taking office the country has seen "our deficits cut by two-thirds." His claim is accurate if you use 2009, his first year in office with an historically high deficit, as a starting point. The claim ignores a stark reality about the deficits, however. The country’s spending is not expected to continue its downward route, according to federal forecasters, for factors that include increased interest payments on the debt and the lack of substantial policy changes for the country’s biggest programs, like Social Security and Medicare. The deficits have largely come down as a result of the improved economy for which Obama cannot assume full credit. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-04495	Massachusetts schools "are ranked No. 1 of all 50 states."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-massachusetts-schools-are-ranked-/	Republican Mitt Romney declared his love for "great schools" during the first presidential debate. Did he go overboard in calling his home state’s schools the best in all the land? Romney’s comments came in response to a dig from President Barack Obama, who said Romney "doesn’t think we need more teachers" while Obama wants to hire 100,000 for math and science. "Well, first, I love great schools," Romney replied. "Massachusetts, our schools are ranked No. 1 of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own." Many education experts say Romney is right about Massachusetts, which he governed for four years, boasting the nation’s best schools. (We should note that Romney did not say his actions specifically made the state No. 1, so we won't grade him on whether he gets credit or not. ) One prominent Twitter user -- Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat and Obama surrogate -- strongly disagreed with Romney's brag. "Hey, Governor @MittRomney, Maryland schools are #1 and have been for the last four years in a row. #Debates," tweeted O’Malley. Look, no one wants a schoolyard rumble over which state has the best schools. We decided to intervene and analyze Romney’s claim. Bay State students are testing beasts Unfortunately for this check, there’s no clear-cut comparison of school quality by state. Too many states have their own annual assessments, for example, one of many factors making an apples-to-apples comparison pretty unobtainable. Instead, education experts tend to go by one across-the-board measure they can get: the National Assessment of Education Progress, or NAEP, which is an exam administered to a sample of fourth, eighth and twelfth grade students every two years in reading and math. All states and DC have been included since 2003. The NAEP is called "the nation’s report card," and Massachusetts students have long been dominant. That’s not to say Bay State students always outperform their peers on every administration of the exam, said Chad d'Entremont, executive director of the Rennie Center, which provides independent, nonpartisan research to inform public education reform in Massachusetts. "But they do score No. 1 on a majority of the assessments," he said, "and taken as a whole, I think it’s fair to say they are among the top performers, if not the top performer." The state’s fourth and eighth graders have scored the highest or tied for first in reading on the NAEP since 2002. Fourth graders have been similarly strong math since 1996, and eighth graders have been the nation’s very best since 2007 after lingering near the top of the pack since 1992. It’s worth pointing out that some groups, such as the National Education Association, do not think "horse race" state rankings based on NAEP scores is a good idea. The group pointed us to a paper by Bert Stoneberg, who directed NAEP at the Idaho Department of Education, that advises against ranking states without factoring in standard error, which would show more ties (our data showed the ties). "This may be one of the reasons that the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) specifically does not rank states," NEA spokeswoman Staci Maier said in an email. Other evaluations The state ranks well in other measures, too. Massachusetts placed first in a 2011 analysis of high school students’ performance in physics and calculus. The Daily Beast featured Massachusetts in the top spot in its feature "America’s Smartest Kids," which primarily relied on NAEP scores. And a 2011 Harvard University study determined Massachusetts students perform at levels on par with some of the world’s most educated countries. The state had the country’s highest percentage of students at the advanced level in math (about 15 percent), running with countries like Belgium, Canada, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands. So Massachusetts students have the highest testing outcomes of the nation. Some experts say it’s debatable whether the school system should get the credit. Massachusetts has a high standard of living, high household incomes and a high-performing university system. Don’t these give their students an inherent advantage over states with more low-income students? It’s unclear. Education experts also link student success with the aggressive education reform law Massachusetts passed in 1993. These reforms established a state accountability system that became the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS. The law also authorized charter schools and provided more money to the poorest school districts. "Massachusetts has a number of factors in place that create a strong foundation for successful schools and high student performance," d'Entremont said. "Over two decades of education reform have taken advantage of that to make sure students are doing well." We should also note that for all of its proficiency in reading and math, Massachusetts has an achievement-gap issue -- one that Romney said narrowed during his single term as governor (Half True). The achievement gap is the disparity in performance between primarily white, middle- and upper-class students, consistently the strongest students, and their black, Latino and low-income peers. While Massachusetts ranks high for low-income and African-American students, its largest minority group -- Latino -- trails other states, most noticeably in eighth grade reading and science. "Despite its high rankings, Massachusetts continues to have achievement gaps that are about as large, and sometimes larger, than the national average," said Blair Mann, a spokeswoman for the Education Trust. "Despite all of its progress, the state still has a long way to go." Another area for improvement: its freshman graduation rate of public high school students. According to the United States Department of Education, seven states beat Massachusetts’ percentage of 83.3 percent in the 2008-2009 academic year. So what about Maryland? So where does all that leave Maryland and their proud governor, Martin O’Malley? Also on top, just by a different measure. Education Week has ranked Maryland as the nation’s overall best state for education for the past four years in Quality Counts, a special annual edition. Massachusetts neared the top In the same four-year period, including a second-place overall finish in 2012. But Maryland had the edge in 2012 in categories such as teaching incentives and allocation, college readiness, early childhood education, and economy and workforce. Massachusetts finished first in more specific categories relating to K-12 achievement and adult outcomes. Our ruling Romney has good reason to say Massachusetts has the nation’s best schools. Although there’s no yardstick comparing the quality of schools by state, by several measures, including test results from a federal standardized test, he is right. His claim would be more airtight if he had said Massachusetts had the best testing outcomes. That said, experts are not unanimous in heralding Massachusetts as the nation’s education leader. Education Week has given the state high marks but given its top distinction to Maryland for the past four years. All considered, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12573	"In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their (gross domestic product) in the form of remittances."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/11/mike-rogers/alabama-lawmaker-makes-half-true-claim-about-remit/	While President Donald Trump maintains that Mexico will pay for a border wall, Republican lawmakers are looking for other ways to help fund the president’s signature campaign promise. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., introduced the Border Wall Funding Act of 2017 to levy a 2 percent fee on money sent by individuals in the United States to recipients in nations "south of the U.S. border," funds known as remittances. "This bill is simple – anyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall," Rogers said in a March 30 press release. He added some large numbers about remittances to bolster his case. "Remittances, or wire transfers, are commonly used by illegal immigrants to move money from the U.S. to their home countries," Rogers said. "In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances." Remittances serve as a source of income for migrants’ families who generally use the money to pay for housing, food and other living expenses. To an extent, Rogers’ two-fold statement is backed by data. The exception is his point about South America — we could not find any countries on that continent with remittances anywhere near 15 percent of GDP. Money sent to Mexico checks out Rogers’ bill seeks to tax immigrants living in the United States illegally who send money back to their countries, according to a press release from his office. The text of the bill itself does not explicitly address how people here unlawfully could be targeted. Experts have told us that while undocumented immigrants do send remittances, it’s hard to determine how much they send, since U.S. citizens and immigrants living here legally also send money. Mexico receives more money from U.S. residents than does any other nation, by far. Rogers’ statement about remittances sent to Mexico is based on data from the World Bank. The World Bank has for several years estimated the bilateral flow of remittances from its member countries. The latest number is actually higher than what Rogers said. Mexico received more than $25.6 billion in remittances from individuals in the United States in 2015, according to the most recent World Bank estimates. Mexico also topped the list as the country receiving the most remittances from the United States from 2010-15, according to a May 2016 Congressional Research Service report. China came in second and India placed third. Money sent to South and Central American countries Rogers claimed that some South and Central American countries receive more than 15 percent of their gross domestic product, or GDP, in the form of remittances. We asked what countries he had in mind. A spokesperson pointed to Haiti, a poor island in the Caribbean, as well as Honduras and El Salvador in Central America. (The spokesperson added that Rogers' statement was actually based on 2015 data, not 2014.) A country’s GDP is an indicator of the health and size of its economy. Comparing remittances to a country’s GDP can be helpful in understanding the economic effects of foreign labor migration and money sent to residents across countries. In other words, a large remittance total may be less eye-popping when it’s compared to the broader economy — and vice versa. "For example, if I tell you that in 2015, Mexico received $26 billion in remittances and Haiti received $2.2 billion, you might think that remittances are far more important to the Mexican economy than they are to Haiti's," said Roy Germano, a New York University professor who has researched migrants’ remittances. "But the fact is, Mexico's economy is much larger than Haiti's (as is its population)." Remittances to Haiti represent a much greater share of income for the country than they do in Mexico. In 2015, remittances from the United States accounted for more than 15 percent of Haiti’s GDP and about 2.2 percent of Mexico’s GDP. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Small island states or small, impoverished countries are most likely to have shares of remittances at 15 percent or more of GDP, said Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes, professor and chair of the economics department at San Diego State University. Tajikistan, in Central Asia, has depended on remittances since years-long armed conflict in the 1990s claimed more than 100,000 lives, noted the Congressional Research Service’s report. Tajikistan topped a CRS list as the country with the greatest percentage of its 2014 GDP in form of remittances (from all places), at nearly 42 percent. Rogers’ office did not provide any examples of countries from South America with remittances via the United States that amount to more than 15 percent of GDP. We crunched the numbers for South America and found that none came close to 15 percent. Here’s a sample: Percent of Guyana’s GDP in form of remittances? 5.9 percent. Ecuador: 1.02 percent. Colombia: 0.5 percent. Bolivia: 0.4 percent. Brazil: 0.04 percent Venezuela: 0.01 percent (based on 2013 GDP/remittances data) Our ruling Rogers said, "In 2014, Mexico alone received over $24 billion in remittances sent from the U.S., while other South and Central American countries received over 15 percent of their GDPs in the form of remittances." Based on World Bank estimates, Mexico did receive more than $24 billion in remittances from the United States in 2015 (the year Rogers meant to use). Rogers would have been on safer ground in the second part of his statement had he described nations south of the border more generally. According to the latest data, a couple of countries in Central America — El Salvador and Honduras — received at least 15 percent of their GDP from remittances. Haiti, in the Caribbean, also received at least 15 percent. No country from South America reached that threshold. We rate Rogers' statement Half True.

pomt-05961	"(After the auto bailout) General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/25/barack-obama/Barack-Obama-bailout-GM-number-one/	President Barack Obama used his 2012 State of the Union address to tout the success of the federal auto bailout — not that he called it that. "We got the industry to retool and restructure," he said. "Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker." We wondered: Is an American car manufacturer again ruling the roost? The claim Here's how the president set up his claim: "On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back." The U.S. government did sink billions of dollars into the auto industry through the Troubled Asset Relief Program to keep GM and Chrysler from going under. (Though not Ford, which refused that federal money.) In return, it got an ownership stake in GM, now down to about one-third of the company's common stock. And while the automakers haven't exactly repaid the government in full, as executives claimed this summer, overall, a senior editor at Fortune has calculated that TARP has made taxpayers money. Meanwhile, U.S. automakers' sales, including Ford's, are rising. Who's No. 1 Obama's speech used a statistic reported just days earlier: GM and its partners, by selling 9 million vehicles in 2011, once again became the world's top-selling automaker. (GM automobiles include Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC.) The company edged out Toyota, which grabbed the top spot in 2008 as the U.S. economy struggled. Analysts said the turnaround stems from the popularity of its latest vehicles, such as the Chevy Cruze, according to the Washington Post and others. Sales worldwide rose 7.6 percent, an increase of 640,000 more cars and trucks in 2011 from the year before, according to ABC News and the Los Angeles Times. Nearly 4.8 million of the 9 million were sold by Chevrolet. "It is an accomplishment that GM has been able to reverse the tide in the U.S. and Asia, and they are doing very well in emerging markets considering just a few years ago the company was in real challenging straights," said John F. Hoffecker, an auto industry consultant with AlixPartners, told the Los Angeles Times. But there are a few caveats to Obama's claim that the bailout put GM back on top. "Luck is incredibly important — as we've seen for GM these last 12 months," said Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman of auto information site Edmunds.com. "They were really able to benefit from conditions in the marketplace." Consider: • GM's sales number is based on sales by both GM and its joint ventures in China, which aren't wholly owned subsidiaries. That's led Volkswagen, which says it sold 8.2 million vehicles last year, to challenge GM's claim to the top spot. "Rankings are mostly about bragging rights, but there has been a long-running and robust debate over how to account for vehicles sold through affiliates," Reuters reported. "... Some analysts extract those sales from GM's results." • Toyota, which hasn't yet reported results for the full year, had to grapple with an earthquake and tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand. So GM's main competition saw its production and sales decrease. It predicts its sales are down about 6 percent, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, merely the news that Toyota might experience shortages drove up summer demand for American vehicles, Anwyl said. • GM, in addition to getting TARP funds, also went through bankruptcy in 2009. "Companies typically rebound as they exit bankruptcy," Anwyl said. (Of course, it's important to note that the bankruptcy reorganization was made possible by taxpayer funds.) • Ford, which didn't accept TARP funds, has seen its sales increase 11 percent — without Obama's help to "retool and restructure." (It didn't need the bailout in large part because of good timing — it had raised significant money while money was still easy to get, before the credit crunch created by the economic crisis, Anwyl said.) "I think if we're really being fair about the bailouts ... you almost have to wait another two or three years to see how this plays out," Anwyl said. And it won't be easy next year for GM to hold onto its top spot. Its midsize Cruze, for example, will face competition from recent models from Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota and Volkswagen. "That's a staggering amount of competition," Anwyl said. Our ruling Obama's right that GM's sales, along with sales by its affiliates, were No. 1 in the world in 2011. But getting full credit for those affiliates isn't without controversy. Meanwhile, crediting the bailout with GM's No. 1 spot is a stretch in a year when GM also benefited from challenges faced by its key competition. It's also telling that Ford, which wasn't part of the bailout, also has thriving sales. Obama's claim is partially accurate, but leaves out some important details. We rate it Half True. UPDATE: Thanks to a sharp reader, we've updated this item to reflect that while Ford didn't take any of the $85 billion in TARP money for automakers that went mostly to GM and Chrysler, it did get other federal support, such as $5.9 billion in federal loans in 2009 to retool its vehicles, and a $250 million loan guarantee from the Export-Import Bank of the United States to finance export sales in 2010.

pomt-06497	Says someone earning $50,000 a year will fare better under his "9-9-9" plan than under the current tax system.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/oct/13/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-someone-earning-50000-will-save-u/	The more people learn more about Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain's "9-9-9" plan, the more questions they have. One of the bigger ones is how it would affect poorer Americans. We had the chance to put the question to Cain directly during his recent swing through Florida. "Most people are going to pay less in taxes," Cain, a former pizza chain executive, said Oct. 5, 2011, aboard his campaign bus stopped in St. Petersburg. "Why? Because we're expanding the base." Cain told us he even worked out the math himself. Someone earning $50,000 a year would pay less in taxes under his 9-9-9 than they do under the current system, he said. Under the current system, a person who earns $50,000 a year "pays about $10,000 in taxes," Cain said. "A big part of that is the payroll tax." Cain then walked us through his 9-9-9 plan and said the same person would "still have $2,000 left over." "I can't design a system for people who don't want to pay taxes," Cain added. "I can design a system so they can get a job." Cain made a similar comment Oct. 12, 2011, during an interview with MSNBC's Chuck Todd. "Today under the current system, ($50,000-a-year earners) will pay over $10,000 in taxes, assuming standard deductions and standard exemptions. I've gone through the math. $10,000," Cain said. "Now, with 9-9-9, they're going to pay that ... 9 percent tax on their income, so that's only $4,500. They still have $5,500 left over to apply to the sales tax fees. And if you go and look at what they -- how much of it they would probably spend on sales taxes for new goods -- not used. Used goods, they don't pay a sales tax. They are still going to have money left over." We decided to take Cain's analysis that his plan was better for someone earning $50,000 to a trio of tax accountants. Before we tell you the results of their analysis, here's some background on Cain's plan. 9-9-9, Cain says, is the first step to creating a national flat or "fair" tax. It would replace the current complicated tax system with 9 percent personal income tax, a 9 percent national sales tax and a 9 percent tax on businesses. Unlike the current system, Cain's plan includes relatively few opportunities for people or businesses to claim deductions or write off expenses. The personal income tax, for example, would include only two potential exemptions -- people could write off donations to charity and tax filers would get a break for living in impoverished inner cities. Cain's national sales tax would be on top of state and local sales taxes. For this fact-check, we'll only be talking about the personal income tax and the sales tax since the business tax directly affects only business owners and corporations. Cain set the parameters for the $50,000 experiment during our interview. For calculating the tax burden under 9-9-9, Cain assumed that the hypothetical tax filer made no charitable deductions and was not eligible for a tax credit by living in an inner city. So Cain's taxpayer paid the full 9 percent income tax on $50,000 -- or $4,500. Cain then assumed every other dollar was spent on something subject to his 9 percent sales tax, meaning his hypothetical taxpayer contributed an additional $4,095 to the federal government. (Cain's 9-9-9 includes no sales tax on used goods.) That's a total tax paid of $8,595 or a tax rate of 17.19 percent. That's the maximum someone would have to contribute under 9-9-9, unless they spent more than they took in on items subject to the sales tax. Presumably they'd pay less if they saved money or spent money on housing, which we assume wouldn't be subject to a sales tax. But again, we're using Cain's figures. To see how that compared to the same earner under the current system, we reached out to three accountants and asked them to run the numbers. For this analysis, we're measuring the income tax and payroll taxes a worker would be asked to contribute. (Payroll taxes vanish under Cain's plan.) Cain's assumption in this scenario, he told us, was that the taxpayer claimed the standard exemption and nothing else. The exercise showed one thing about the current system: It's certainly more complicated than the system Cain is proposing. For a single person, 9-9-9 is a better deal. A single person with no dependents would pay about $10,075 in combined payroll and federal income taxes, $1,480 more than that taxpayer would pay under Cain's 9-9-9. The calculation comes with one caveat: President Barack Obama and Congress temporarily have lowered the payroll tax contribution for employees 2 percentage points, whereas these figures assume the contribution rate is restored to the full 7.65 percent. For someone married with dependents, 9-9-9 is worse. The current tax code treats married couples with children differently -- and better -- than people who are single. With dependents, the family of four will pay about $6,515 in income and payroll taxes and even less, about $4,600, if they qualify for a child income tax credit. So the family of four could end up paying anywhere from about $2,080 to $4,000 more in federal taxes under Cain's 9-9-9. These are broad strokes that can vary based on your personal situation -- as well as other credits workers might be able to claim under the current tax system -- but they're a good rough guide in understanding Cain's plan. The disparity between 9-9-9 and the current tax code grows as a person's income shrinks. A single person who makes $40,000 would still pay about $334 less in federal taxes under 9-9-9. But someone making $30,000 would pay about $212 more under 9-9-9. For families at those income levels, 9-9-9 is even worse, especially when you include potential tax credits and exemptions low-income earners are now getting that they wouldn't under Cain's plan. "It's going to fall very, very heavily on low-income taxpayers to middle-income taxpayers," Andy Hollander, a retired federal tax agent, who studied the 9-9-9 plan for PolitiFact Florida, told us. Yet Jonathan Kraftchick, another accountant who pored over the numbers for us, pointed out that 9-9-9 allows people to control their final tax liability based on their spending. "Households would be much more in control of what their final tax liabilities would be since the sales tax would effectively allow them to increase/decrease their taxes at will," Kraftchick said. None of this addresses another point. Besides what 9-9-9 might mean for you, there's also the question of what it will mean for the federal government -- namely, if it will generate enough revenue to keep the federal government in business. Cain has said the plan is meant to generate the same amount of revenue initially, but he hasn't released enough detailed information for analysts and economists to see if that's correct. That discussion's for another day. Here we're looking at Cain's answer when we asked how his plan would affect poorer Americans. He responded by saying that someone making $50,000 a year, which is about the median income for all U.S. households, would be better off under his plan than the current tax system. We have two major issues with his response. First, we asked about poorer Americans and he picked an income figure of $50,000 a year, which is the median income for U.S. households. There's some cherry-picking there, since the numbers change if you select $40,000 or $30,000. Moreover, while calculating the impacts of 9-9-9 might be simple, comparing them to the current tax system is much more complicated. Cain's assumption holds when you look at single earners, but married couples and people with children making $50,000 a year would likely pay more under 9-9-9 than the current system. We knock the claim down one mark for cherry-picking a figure of $50,000 a year and two more because the claim itself is only half right. To us, that equals a Mostly False.

pomt-10395	Sen. Obama wants to "enact the single largest tax increase since the Second World War."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/11/john-mccain/two-wrongs-dont-make-a-right/	Sen. Barack Obama will be a record-breaking tax hiker, Sen. John McCain alleged on June 10. He was speaking to the National Small Business Summit in Washington, D.C. Both he and Obama would bring change, McCain said. "The question is what kind of change," said the Arizona senator. "Will we go back to the policies of the '60s and '70s that have failed? Or will we go forward? Will we enact the largest single tax increase since the Second World War as my opponent proposes, or will we keep taxes low — low for families and employers?" That echoed a charge he had leveled a couple months earlier against Obama and then-candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton at Carnegie Mellon University. "By allowing many of the current low tax rates to expire, they would impose — overnight — the single largest tax increase since the Second World War," McCain said. This claim is dubious from the get-go. Although tax revenue would go up under Obama's tax plan, one could argue that he's actually proposing a tax cut. Let us explain: President Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 came with what are called "sunsets," or scheduled expiration dates. Bush has asked Congress several times to make the cuts permanent, but Congress has thus far declined to do so. As the law stands today, the cuts will expire by 2011 and taxes will go back up. Obama wants to allow some of the cuts — specifically those on incomes over $250,000 — to expire. But he wants to keep the cuts on lower incomes, and reduce taxes even further on some of the lowest earners. Obama's plan, according to a June 11 analysis by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, would generate $2.7-trillion less over 10 years than the government would collect if it allowed Bush's cuts to expire on schedule. So calling it a tax increase might not be considered fair. There's no disputing that taxes will rise, but the question of who's responsible for that tax increase is another matter entirely. At PolitiFact, we've concluded, as have others, that it's unfair to call Obama's plan a tax increase merely because it doesn't change existing tax law to keep rates low. We think about it this way: The reason taxes will increase is because of tax policy signed into law not by Obama, but by somebody else. Obama's plan doesn't call for raising taxes. "It's not accurate," said Leonard Burman, co-director of the center. "He's actually proposing a tax cut." Still, it's true that tax revenue would go up under Obama's plan. Revenue would be $1.1-trillion more over the next 10 years under Obama's plan than it would be if the government extended Bush's tax cuts. And the effect of Obama's policy on the economy would be that of a tax increase. So let's indulge McCain for a minute, and call it a tax increase. Now — how big an increase would it be? Let's take one particular year, since past tax increases have been measured over one year. And let's pick 2012, since all of Obama's proposed changes to current policy would be phased in by then. The Tax Policy Center — which is a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., that both liberal and conservative economists consider credible — estimated that under Obama's plan tax revenue in 2012 would be $70.2-billion greater than it would be if Bush's tax cuts were extended. That's just an estimate — the Obama campaign hasn't spelled out every detail of its tax plan — but it's the best one available at this point, several experts said. So how does a $70.2-billion increase compare to other tax increases since World War II? The best source for information on the sizes of past tax increases, several economists told us, is a paper by Jerry Tempalski of the U.S. Treasury Department, "Revenue Effects of Major Tax Bills," updated in 2006. He said the best way to gauge the size of a tax increase is to compare it to the overall size of the economy, otherwise known as the Gross Domestic Product. The $70.2-billion increase under a President Obama is .40 percent of the projected GDP for 2012 ($17.5-trillion). That would be just the ninth-largest increase since World War II, not the largest. However, there are other ways to measure the size of tax increases. Tempalski said the second-best way is by its size in dollars, adjusted for inflation. He compared the historical increases by putting them in 1992 dollars. Obama's $70.2-billion increase in 2012 would be $40.5-billion in 1992 dollars, according to the Congressional Budget Office. By that measure, it would be the second-largest increase since World War II. The Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968, passed under Lyndon Johnson to reduce a deficit swelled by the Vietnam War, yielded a tax increase of $55.3-billion in 1992 dollars. So based on what is known so far about Obama's plan, it would not be the largest since World War II by either of the two best measures. Moreover, Obama's proposal does not constitute a tax increase in the traditional sense, since taxes would be lower under his plan than they would under current law. We find McCain's statement to be False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-11T00:00:00	2008-06-10	['Barack_Obama', 'World_War_II']
pomt-02994	40,000 veterans in Texas won’t get health care because Perry rejected Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/17/gilberto-hinojosa/more-veterans-income-qualify-Medicaid-Texas/	Discussing the chances that state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, might run for lieutenant governor, state Democratic chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said she has support among veterans who haven’t been part of his party’s base in the past. "(I)n the state of Texas, especially with Republicans, with Rick Perry refusing to accept the hundred billion dollars in expanded Medicaid, there's 40,000 veterans in the state of Texas that are not going to receive health care as a result of that decision," Hinojosa said in a Sept. 25, 2013, interview on the YNN cable news channel’s "Capital Tonight" show. Gov. Rick Perry told the federal government that Texas would not expand its Medicaid eligibility to cover more low-income residents, a key Obamacare initiative, in a letter July 19, 2012. It’s not clear that federal reimbursements for those new Medicaid enrollees would have reached $100 billion over 10 years; in an April 2013 fact-check, we found a $90 billion estimate wrongly included $11.6 billion that Texas would get whether it expanded Medicaid or not. Since then, Perry has altered his stance: In a Sept. 16, 2013, letter, he directed the state health commission to ask for a lump sum of money (instead of getting federal dollars for each patient) plus the flexibility to use Texas’ own criteria to determine who qualifies. We wondered how Hinojosa concluded that rejecting expansion would deprive 40,000 Texas veterans of health care. Democratic Party spokeswoman Tanene Allison told us by email that Hinojosa’s claim was based on a March 2013 study by the Washington-based Urban Institute that analyzed Census Bureau data to estimate how many U.S. military veterans aged 19 to 64 in the U.S. don’t have insurance. (Veterans 65 and older qualify, like other Americans, for Medicare.) "According to the analysis," Allison said, "the 48,900 uninsured veterans in Texas whose income is below 138 percent of the federal poverty level could qualify for Medicaid or new subsidies for coverage under the Affordable Care Act if the governor of Texas expands Medicaid." On Aug. 6, 2013, our PolitiFact Georgia colleagues checked a statement based on the same study from the institute, which they said described itself as a nonpartisan research center although its leadership includes several former Clinton administration officials. That PolitiFact story rated as True a claim that by rejecting an expansion of Medicaid under the Obamacare law, Georgia was depriving 25,000 veterans of health care coverage. Medicaid is an insurance program operated by states in partnership with the federal government, aimed at reimbursing doctors who care for patients in low-income groups such as elderly and disabled people, children and pregnant women. Obamacare included a provision that federal money would cover all costs for the first three years for states to extend Medicaid to households earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level — which in 2013 is $15,865 for an individual, $32,499 for a family of four. In Texas, about 1 million adults were on Medicaid in January 2013, according to the website of the state Health and Human Services Commission, which administers Medicaid. Most were eligible because they were pregnant, disabled, older than 65 or raising children on a household income that was below the federal poverty line. If Texas went along with Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion provisions, the state commission’s most recent estimates, from 2012, predict another 341,000 Texas adults would get on Medicaid in 2014 -- reflecting people who earn less than $15,800 a year (for a one-person household) but weren’t already qualified to get Medicaid for another reason. In a May 2012 report, the Urban Institute said 130,000 non-elderly veterans in Texas have no health insurance -- about 8 percent of the state’s veterans and 13.1 percent of its non-elderly veterans. The institute based its estimate on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2009 and 2010 American Community Surveys, adjusted to correct for suspected errors such as high reports of private coverage among low-income families. To describe income groups, the researchers used modified adjusted gross income, the measure that will be used under the Obamacare law. Of those 130,000 non-elderly Texas veterans, the institute’s March 2013 study said, 48,900 earned less than 138 percent of the federal poverty guideline. State health commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman emailed us a lower number: 42,771, based on the 2011 American Community Survey. So it looks like more than 40,000 non-elderly veterans would be eligible, total, if Texas expanded Medicaid to all adults earning less than 138 percent of the poverty guideline. Hinojosa said those veterans "are not going to receive health care." Experts told us, however, that some might already be eligible for Medicaid or for health care through the federal Department of Veterans Affairs. Under Texas’ current Medicaid rules, Goodman said, some of the veterans could be eligible because they are pregnant, have a disability or are raising children on a below-poverty income. "But we don't have a good way to estimate what that number would be," she said. Jennifer Haley, an author of the Urban Institute study, told us by email, "It's definitely the case that some of these veterans are eligible for VA care ... While our data can't tell us which of these uninsured veterans could qualify, many low-income veterans likely would." Nationwide, about 40 percent of veterans get health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its network of VA hospitals, clinics and other facilities, according to a September 2012 report from the Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families at the University of Southern California. According to the VA’s website, its full health care plan is generally available free to veterans who have an injury or condition related to their military combat service, to veterans coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan for the first five years after they return and to veterans below certain income thresholds. Others may qualify for part or all of the services at varying costs. Jessica Jacobsen, a spokeswoman at the VA’s Dallas office, told us that as of August 2013, 665,000 Texas veterans were enrolled in VA care and 440,000 were eligible but unenrolled. Many of those unenrolled, however, could have private or other government coverage, as more than half of veterans nationwide do according to the veterans center report. Among Texas’ low-income veterans, Haley said, "There are a number of factors that could keep these eligible veterans from enrolling" in VA care — lack of information about VA coverage, for example. "It's also possible that some may live too far from VA facilities and they are therefore not convenient options." Our ruling Hinojosa said there are "40,000 veterans in the state of Texas that are not going to receive health care as a result of" the decision to reject expanding Medicaid. Two calculations based on Census data suggest 42,771 or 48,900 uninsured Texas veterans earn less than what would be the poverty threshold for adults qualifying for Medicaid if Texas had embraced that part of the Obamacare law. That’s not the same thing as saying they won’t "receive health care"; in fact, some likely qualify now for Medicaid or VA care, but aren’t signed up. Hinojosa had a reasonable basis for his figure, but his statement lacked this clarification. We rate it as Mostly True.

pomt-04238	Says the initial Portland plastic bag ban represented "only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/nov/20/sam-adams/did-portlands-bag-ban-only-target-modest-portion-s/	Last week, the Portland City Council voted to significantly expand its year-old ban on single-use plastic bags. By October of next year, the ban, which currently targets big-box stores and supermarkets, will affect "all retail establishments and food providers." The initial rule, passed last year, targeted fewer than 200 businesses. The new rule will reach an estimated 5,000 restaurants and retailers, including food carts, farmers markets and corner stores. In a draft ordinance, released by the mayor’s office before the vote, his office outlined some of the council’s findings on the matter. Among them was this interesting bit about the initial ordinance: "Portland City Council adopted Ordinance 184759 as a first step to promote the use of reusable checkout bags. The policy reduced single-use plastic shopping bag consumption, but this initial scope represents only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use." We know, of course, that modest is a somewhat subjective term, but even so, we found its usage odd given that we remember the initial ordinance being touted as a significant victory. We called the mayor’s office and asked: What percentage of single-use plastic bags did the initial ordinance target and what percentage does this new ordinance target? We got this response in an email back from Sam Adams’ spokeswoman Caryn Brooks: So, you’re fact checking the phrase "While Portland’s initial ordinance addresses the large grocery store and pharmacy users of single-use plastic bags, the initial scope represents only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use" that was in our blog post with a focus on the term "modest share." The term "modest share" is referring to the number of outlets required to ban single use bag usage in the original scope, which was 167 outlets. The next two phases will include some 5,000 outlets. Comparatively, we consider 167 outlets modest." Certainly, 167 outlets compared to some 5,000 is modest. But when we read the draft ordinance, we didn’t take this section to be talking about outlets at all -- we read it to be about the share of plastic bags banned. Let’s go back to the statement in the draft ordinance: "(T)his initial scope represents only a modest share of total single-use checkout bag use." It’s clearly discussing bag usage -- not the number of outlets. So, we reiterated our interest in any information regarding the way the initial ban affected usage and any projections on how the subsequent ban might. When Brooks got back to us, she said, "It is a number that we do not have access to and was never an element of the policy creation ... "We never set out to reduce a particular percentage, because ultimately even a small percentage is too many. Obviously as you decrease the number of outlets that use plastic bags, the number of bags being used will decrease." When it comes to fact checking for PolitiFact Oregon, the onus is always on the speakers -- in this case, the mayor’s office -- to back up the statements they are making. So, we followed up one last time in a phone call to be absolutely sure the office had no information on the initial reduction in single-use plastic bag usage. Brooks reiterated that we had misread the ordinance -- though she conceded it could have been clearer -- and that it was referring to outlets not usage. She also made the case that the second ordinance was not predicated on how successful the first ordinance was. It was always the intention, she said, to re-evaluate and push the ban further. That is all fine and good, but ultimately we can only work with what is before us. The fact is that in trying to communicate with the public regarding furthering the city’s plastic bag ban, the mayor’s office made it sound as though the initial ban really only took a small chunk of single-use plastic bags out of circulation, even though they have nothing to base such a statement on. (For what it’s worth, we made a call to Joe Gilliam, the president of the Northwest Grocery Association. He didn’t have any hard numbers on the bans either. He said it was probably safe to say that the initial ordinance targeted "a third of the volume --- but again, I caution the numbers.") We understand that the mayor’s office may not have intended to mean plastic bag usage, but it read that way to us -- and likely many others. Words matter. The statement contains an element of truth -- a smaller number of outlets was affected initially -- but the mayor’s office has no facts to back up its assertion that the first ban represented a modest share of bag use. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2012-11-20T16:49:47	2012-11-09	['None']
pomt-01732	Women "own just 1 percent of the world’s land."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/05/oxfam-ireland/do-women-own-1-worlds-land-no/	Women around the world have a hard row to hoe, but do they really own just 1 percent of all the land? That’s the claim in a tweet from Oxfam Ireland. A reader saw Oxfam’s infographic with the stat and asked us to check it. We’ve found similar statements about global poverty to lack a firm grounding in the facts (70 percent of the world’s poor are not women) and that’s the case with this one, too. Sorcha Nic Mhathuna, a spokeswoman for Oxfam Ireland, the national chapter of the worldwide anti-poverty group, said her organization is "reviewing" this factoid. "We are aware that this statistic is the subject of substantive debate," Mhathuna said. Still, Mhathuna could point to some very big organizations that have taken this number as settled fact. In 2012, the World Bank published a report on women, business and the law which said, "UN Women (the United Nations office focused on women’s issues) informs us that "women perform 66 percent of the world’s work, produce 50 percent of the food, but earn 10 percent of the income and own 1 percent of the property." But the source the World Bank cited is a defunct Web page at the United Nations from a UN division that no longer exists. Oxfam Ireland also listed a 2013 joint report from UN Women and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights that said, "it is reported that just 1 percent of the world’s women actually own land." The source for that? A line from a Web page at the International Center for Research on Women, a group based in Washington. That Web page provided no source and when we contacted the center, they directed us to a 2002 brochure from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization that also offered no supporting data. What the (limited) numbers say For all the references back to UN Women, someone forgot to ask the professionals there who know the data. Papa Seck, a statistician in the Research and Data Section at UN Women, said there are no global figures on land ownership. "I can tell you for sure that this is not a valid statistic," Seck said. Agnes Quisumbing, a senior fellow with the International Food Policy and Research Institute, a group focused on pragmatic solutions to hunger and poverty, has pushed back against this stat. In 2013, Quisumbing co-authored an article on gender and land ownership in Africa. Quisumbing and her colleagues noted that measuring land ownership is hardly as simple as it sounds. A woman might have the right to farm a plot of land but not be able to sell it without permission from relatives. Husbands and wives might hold joint title. On top of the need to define what it means to own land, much of the information simply doesn’t exist. Few surveys ask about land ownership at all and those that do often don’t ask about gender. After looking at the best studies they could find, Quisumbing and the others decided that any statement at the global or even regional level would be a "gross oversimplification." That said, using research from eight African countries, they found that women were generally less likely to be landholders, but the range was large. In Mali, women represented about 3 percent, in Ethiopia, about 18 percent and in Cape Verde, 50 percent. The authors underscored a common misinterpretation when looking at gender and ownership: The percentage held by women does not mean that men control the rest. In South Africa’s Natal Province for example, 10 percent of women had their name on an ownership document, but the number for men was 29 percent. The bulk of the land might be owned by the community, the government or some other entity. In March, Cheryl Doss, a development economist at Yale University, used an Oxfam blog to criticize advocates for using the claim that women own a tiny percentage of land. "Women’s land rights are critically important," Doss wrote. "Yet, using unsubstantiated statistics for advocacy is counterproductive. Advocates lose credibility by making claims that are inaccurate and slow down progress towards achieving their goals because without credible data, they also can’t measure changes." Doss offered some statistics that advocates could use. "On average, across 10 countries in Africa, 39 percent of women and 48 percent of men report owning land, including both individual and joint ownership. Only 12 percent of women report owning land individually, while 31 percent of men do so." Broadly speaking, the pattern holds true in Central and South America. Carmen Diana Deere is a professor in the Latin American Studies department at the University of Florida. Looking at who owns which parcel of land, Deere found that in Mexico, women owned about 20 percent of the parcels, men owned 66 percent and 14 percent were held jointly. That was the high water mark for female ownership in Deere’s study. At the other end of the spectrum, in Honduras, women owned 12 percent and men owned about 87 percent, with about 1 percent held jointly. But even in Honduras, the figures refute the Oxfam Ireland claim. Deere said she and others have made this general point since at least 2001. Quisumbing expressed some frustration about Oxfam Ireland’s use of the errant stat. She had brought this up with the American chapter of Oxfam at a meeting in Boston in mid April. "I gave a seminar at Oxfam with a lot of people videoconferenced in and yet these myths prevail," Quisumbing said. The origins of the 1 percent claim As near as anyone can tell, this factoid emerged in 1978. In a 2013 article debunking this myth in The Atlantic, University of Maryland sociologist Philip Cohen, tracked it back to a paper published by the International Labor Organization titled "Women at Work." Cohen reported that the paper’s author said her numbers were "based on some available global data, and others derived by use of fragmentary indicators at the time." Lacking hard data, she made broad assumptions that women earned so much less than men that "it can be assumed that they normally do not have any surplus to invest." In other words, the 1 percent statistic about land was a guess. And it stuck. Our ruling Oxfam Ireland circulated a graphic with the claim that women own 1 percent of the world’s land. The organization cited well-known bodies such as the World Bank and the United Nations, but none of those sources offered hard evidence. In fact, several pointed back to UN Women, and statisticians there reject this figure. The data that do exist suggest that women own much less land than men but the situation varies widely from country to country. Plus, the statistic implies that whatever land women don’t own, men do, and that is hugely incorrect. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03530	"The UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/31/peter-nightingale/university-rhode-island-professor-says-united-king/	The Rhode Island Board of Education voted on May 23, 2013, to authorize its two colleges and the University of Rhode Island to arm their campus police if they so chose. Prior to the vote, as the board and the General Assembly were considering the issue, URI Prof. Peter Nightingale expressed his opposition. In a commentary published May 8 on RIFuture.org, Nightingale wrote that the proposal came out of "little more than violence and fear-enhancing recommendations." He wrote that having armed police can lead, out of fear, to shooting unarmed people. And he drew this comparison: "The UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S." We wanted to know whether he got his facts right. We tried to contact Nightingale, who teaches physics, but he did not return phone messages or e-mails. Anyone who read about the recent knife attack on a British soldier in London, in which the accused assailants were eventually shot by armed police, might immediately question the first part of the statement. So we checked to see what British news accounts, police department information and other documents would show about whether the police in the United Kingdom are unarmed. A BBC News Magazine article, published online in September 2012 and headlined "Why British police don’t have guns," said that "to most inhabitants of the UK -- with the notable exception of Northern Ireland -- it is a normal, unremarkable state of affairs that most front-line officers do not carry guns." Most, the article said. It goes on to say that "each police force has its own firearms unit." Then we found statistics from the Home Office, a government department in the United Kingdom that is responsible for everything from issuing passports, to reducing crime, to dealing with threat of terrorism, indicated that there are "authorized firearms officers" throughout the United Kingdom. In the year ending March 31, 2011, there were 6,653 such officers in England and Wales -- about five percent of the total -- down from 6,979 the previous year. Most but not all the police in Scotland do not regularly carry firearms, according to Police-Information.co.UK, a site for those involved in law enforcement in the United Kingdom. And the number of times armed officers fired their guns in a year in England and Wales, according to the figures reported by the government, can sometimes be counted on one hand. During 2010-2011, police "discharged a conventional firearm in three incidents," a drop from six such incidents in 2009-2010, according to data published by the British Parliament. In the year ending March 31, 2011, the use of armed officers was authorized in 17,209 operations in England and Wales. Of that total, the Metropolitan Police -- known as the Met -- who cover metropolitan London, were authorized to have armed officers in 4,672 operations. The Metropolitan Police, according to its website, has a Specialist Firearm Command, known as SCO19, which "provides firearms-related support to our unarmed colleagues." "When the officers first arrive they will make an immediate assessment. If an armed containment is deemed necessary to isolate an armed suspect from the public, then two of the crew will deploy leaving one to control the incident, calling for further armed support and liaising with the local senior police officer," the Metropolitan Police website states. "All these officers are personally armed with 'Glock' 17 self-loading pistols and two of the officers have access to 'Heckler and Koch' MP5 carbines." And, the Metropolitan Police site adds, the force has specialist firearms officers who "undergo advanced firearms training and are also available 24 hours a day." Next, we looked at the second part: that the United Kingdom firearm fatality rate is 40 times lower per capita than in the United States. Gunpolicy.org, a firearm safety database hosted by the Sydney School of Public Health in Australia and partly co-funded by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, keeps data on gun deaths by nation. In 2011, the rate of gun deaths of all kinds, including suicide, was 10.3 per 100,000 population in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the rate was 0.25 per 100,000. That is indeed 40 times less than the rate in the U.S. So Nightingale’s figure checked out. (The gap is even wider for "gun homicides": in 2011, the United Kingdom’s rate was 0.04 per 100,000 people, 90 times less than the 3.6 per 100,000 in the United States.) Our ruling Peter Nightingale, a University of Rhode Island professor, wrote that "the UK has an unarmed police force and a firearm fatality rate that is 40 times lower per capita than in the U.S." It’s true that some police officers in the United Kingdom are armed, but it’s a very small percentage. The vast majority are unarmed. And Nightingale is on target in saying that there are far fewer gun deaths in the United Kingdom than in the United States. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Peter Nightingale	None	None	None	2013-05-31T00:01:00	2013-05-08	['United_States']
pomt-00744	Georgia has had the nation’s busiest Court of Appeals for a decade or more.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/20/charlie-bethel/no-firm-evidence-often-repeated-claim-about-court-/	The 2015 General Assembly session was expected to conclude by midnight April 2, and lawmakers were racing against the clock. Veteran state Sen. Vincent Fort, a Democrat from Atlanta, was in the well of the chamber, lamenting that lawmakers were being asked on the fly to increase the size of the Georgia Court of Appeals by three judges -- or 25 percent. The one-year cost to taxpayers, with support staff, would be $1.5 million. "I have grave concerns for how we’re doing this business of such great consequences at this late hour. It smacks of packing the court, and it’s not something we should be doing at 11:05 (p.m.) on sine die," he said. Fort was then asked a question that summed up the key point of supporters. "Is it not true that Georgia’s Court of Appeals is the busiest intermediate court of appeals in the country and has been for a decade or more?" Sen. Charlie Bethel, R-Dalton, asked in traditional legislative parlance. The plan to expand the Court of Appeals passed the state Senate late on the 40th and last day of the legislative session, 37-18, as an amendment to a House bill raising judges’ salaries. PolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Bethel’s statement for two reasons: Legislators didn’t publicly vet the case for increasing the court from 12 to 15 judges; and the added costs fall to taxpayers. The Georgia Court of Appeals was created in 1906 and has jurisdiction over many types of appeals. Exceptions include murder, divorce, alimony, constitutional questions and election contests, all of which are heard by the state’s highest court, the Georgia Supreme Court. By its own calculations, the Court of Appeals’ caseload increased yearly for 20 years and peaked in 1995. New appeals have been relatively steady in recent years -- 3,260 in 2009, 3,212 in 2010, 3,312 in 2011, 3,464 in 2012, and 3,432 in 2013, the last year for which data is available. So how is it that Georgia is thought to have the nation’s busiest intermediate court of appeals? Arguably the best case for the claim is an apparently unique provision in the Georgia Constitution. It mandates that the state’s two appellate courts -- the Georgia Supreme Court and the Georgia Court of Appeals -- rule on any appeal within two court terms, or in about eight months. Failure to meet that deadline means the prior court ruling in the case stands. Stephen E. Castlen, the clerk of the court of the Court of Appeals, said cases move through the court "in rocket fashion as far as compared to courts of appeals around the country." "It’s intense," Castlen said. "It’s a commonly held belief that we’re the busiest. You hear it talked about at conferences. Every book I’ve read or article will have a line in there somewhere that we’re one of the busiest courts in the country. I can’t imagine it’s not true." William Raftery, an analyst with the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., said he has reviewed the constitutions of all states and, "to my knowledge," concluded that only Georgia places a two-term deadline on its appeals courts. But the center steers clear of labels such as "busiest" court because apples-to-apples comparisons aren’t realistic given that not all state intermediate courts of appeals handle the same types of appeals, have the same volume of cases, have the same number of judges or handle cases in the same way. And even though Georgia is the only state with a constitutional requirement that cases be completed in two terms, other states, such as Maryland, have set case turnaround goals to ensure that appeals move quickly, the center’s data experts said. "The national center would not say X is busier than Y for those reasons," Raftery said. Last year and this year, resolutions were introduced in the state Senate to have a study committee look at the Court of Appeals’ caseload and the possibility of creating three new judgeships. But that proposal became moot when, late last month, Gov. Nathan Deal sent word to House and Senate budget negotiators that there was an extra $45.8 million to spend and 15 items he’d like the money to target. One of those items would allow him to appoint three additional judges to the 12-member Court of Appeals. Judges on the court make about $166,000 a year. Claims about the court’s caseload have persisted since the 1990s. Bethel, an attorney and chairman of the Senate Committee on Insurance and Labor, told PolitiFact he’s been hearing about the Court of Appeals’ caseload and record as the nation’s busiest court since he was in law school in the late 1990s. He emailed us links to newspaper articles, a law review article and an online history of the court, all of which included claims along those lines. For instance, Court of Appeals Judge Herbert E. Phipps was quoted in The Albany Herald in May 2013 saying the court was the nation’s busiest based on caseload per capita. The court’s website doesn’t go quite that far. It says that during the 1990s, the Georgia Court of Appeals was, "on the basis of the number of cases decided by each judge, one of the busiest appellate courts in the country." An analysis, conducted by the state’s Administrative Office of the Courts in 1995, found that the court was the nation’s busiest in 1993 -- based on signed opinions per judge. The Georgia court, which had nine members then, averaged 278 signed opinions per judge that year, and California was second with 137 signed opinions per judge. We found other similar claims even on Wikipedia, but none that said the court is currently the nation’s busiest and has been for a decade or more. Bethel told us he was surprised that there was any question about the court being the busiest. "The judges say it. They don’t say they think it," he said. "They say it definitely." Our ruling. The Georgia Constitution is apparently unique in that it requires the state’s two appellate courts to handle appeals within two terms, or in about eight months. That undoubtedly requires the justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals to work swiftly. And it does a lot to boost the credibility of the often-repeated statement that the court is among the nation’s busiest. But experts say there is no absolute measure out there to compare the court’s workload to that of other courts. That’s a lot of missing context.

pomt-05518	The 2011 Legislature did not cut Texas public school funding.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/apr/12/susan-combs/comptroller-susan-combs-says-state-lawmakers-did-n/	State Comptroller Susan Combs, whose duties include oversight of state finances, delivered a contradictory assessment of how Texas lawmakers treated public schools while writing the state budget in 2011. According to a news story in the Bryan-College Station Eagle, Combs was asked by a local audience member on April 4, 2012, how much the state cut from public education. The story says Combs replied that the state didn't reduce funding, instead adding $2 billion. "It was not less, but it was not as much," Combs said, according to the story, which we learned of from an April 6, 2012, Twitter post by state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin. His accompanying message described Combs’ not less-but not as much statement as the "effort to hide education budget cuts, in 1 sentence." Before gauging Combs’ claim, we tried to pin down what she said. Her spokesman, RJ DeSilva, told us her appearance was not recorded by the comptroller’s office. Separately, when we inquired, Eagle education reporter Cassie Smith sent us her notes from the event, which indicate that Combs said both that school funding was not cut and that there was not as much funding as lawmakers or the state would have spent. According to the notes, an attendee asked: "How much did we actually cut funding from public education?" Combs: "Well, we didn’t actually cut it. I think the number was that we actually put in about $2 billion, if my recollections from what I read, but it was not the amount that they would have spent. So it was not less, but it was not as much. What happened was schools have to take a look at what do we do with staff. What do we do with expenditures? What do we do with various things? I know there’s been a debate about it." Smith’s notes say two local school superintendents then chimed in with how much less they’ll be receiving. Combs: "OK." Then, Smith’s notes say, Combs started talking about community colleges and graduation rates. Confirmed: Combs said that funding to school districts was not cut. And is that correct? DeSilva told us by email that Combs’ claim reflected figures in the Legislative Budget Board’s January 2012 "Fiscal Size-up" report for the current budget period, 2012-13. The report shows lawmakers put about $150 million more in state revenue into public education than was appropriated in 2010-11. Also, DeSilva said, Combs was referring to the decision to defer a $2.3 billion payment otherwise due to school districts in the current budget period to September 2013. DeSilva said Combs’ published comment -- "It was not less, but it was not as much" -- reflected the fact that changes to the state’s school funding formula "meant districts would be entitled to an estimated $4 billion less than they would have been entitled to had school finance formulas remained unchanged... So while" state "funding went up, schools would have received more funding if the formula had not changed," DeSilva said. Our takeaway: Combs says that lawmakers put more state revenue into education, yet changed finance formulas so schools would get $4 billion less than if the formulas had stayed the same and also deferred a regular payment to school districts to the next budget. The latter two points are factually solid, covering territory that we crossed in checking a legislator’s claim about education funding, though the deferred payment strikes us as more indicative of less education aid in the current budget period. However, the $150 million state spending increase relied upon by Combs delivers an incomplete picture of what lawmakers spent. The state’s "general revenue" increase pales in comparison to reductions in other funds appropriated for public education. Notably, $3.3 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid that legislators used in 2009 to cover some of the state’s tab for basic school aid was not available in 2011. Meanwhile, public education funding from all sources in the 2012-13 state budget decreased $2.8 billion, or 5.6 percent, as the federal stimulus aid went away, according to the 2012 Fiscal Size-up. Results in individual school districts would vary, but an accurate broad answer to the audience member’s question about school funding cuts would be that the schools sustained a legislated reduction in education funding adding up to more than $5 billion through 2012-13, a total that rolls in the $4 billion in reductions of formula-driven aid plus other cuts in targeted programs such as teacher incentive pay, dropout prevention funding and zeroed-out grants to the pre-Kindergarten Early Start program. Our ruling Lawmakers cut public school aid, mainly by changing an established funding formula and reducing aid to targeted programs. To say otherwise is inaccurate, misleading and by a wide margin ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Susan Combs	None	None	None	2012-04-12T11:30:00	2012-04-04	['Texas']
pomt-14038	Only 50 percent of students from Milwaukee public high schools "go on to a two-or four-year college."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/27/vicki-martin/it-true-only-half-milwaukee-public-schools-student/	What is behind the "skills gap" that business and civic leaders often say inhibits economic progress in the Milwaukee metropolitan area? Milwaukee Area Technical College President Vicki Martin points to a low percentage of Milwaukee public high school students going on to college as one factor. Martin spoke May 12, 2016 on a WisPolitics panel about narrowing the skills gap, along with Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce President Tim Sheehy. Kleefisch first described the skills gap saying, "the folks that employers are seeking don’t necessarily represent the skill sets that those job seekers actually have." Then Martin picked up the mic -- and the theme. "So contributing to that gap, or the mismatch as you outlined, is the fact that we have a lot of folks not even going into the college environment," Martin said. "We found out in our community, for example, in Milwaukee high schools only 50 percent were going on to two- or four-year institutions." There are multiple high school options in Milwaukee, when you factor in choice and charter schools. But Martin was focusing on Milwaukee Public Schools, so we will as well. Is it true that half of all those who complete MPS enroll in a two- or four-year college program? We decided to check it out. The numbers When we asked Martin for backup on the claim, her team sent us to the Department of Public Instruction’s WISEdash database. The database matches information on those who complete high school with college-level enrollment figures from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, a nonprofit group that tracks students and provides data to local governments and other entities. The center collects enrollment data from more than 3,300 institutions across the nation that account for 96 percent of all students in two- and four-year college programs. The most recent data is for students who completed high school at the end of the 2013-’14 academic year. In fall of that year, some 37.7 percent of MPS completers -- a category that includes, for instance, those who get a G.E.D. -- enrolled in a two- or four-year program. Another 12.6 percent enrolled at a later date. That puts enrollment in college at just above 50 percent for the group. In comparison, 66.3 percent of high school completers statewide enrolled in a two- or four-year program. Over time, of course, students from each group continue to begin college programs, so the percentage keeps growing. For instance, for students who completed MPS in 2012, the percentage is now 59.6 percent. To be sure, the data has its limits. The National Clearinghouse Research Center only tracks students after completing high school -- so those who don’t finish high school aren’t included. In MPS, about 60 percent of all students complete high school in four years and 70 percent finish in six. That means fewer than half of all students who attended MPS wind up enrolling in an institution of higher learning. Here’s a rough calculation to account for students who did not complete high school. For the 2014 cohort, 60.9 percent finished high school on time from MPS. Of those, just about half have enrolled in additional education. So, of all students in that group, about 30 percent have gone on to higher learning. So, from that perspective, Martin’s statement actually overstates the number. In other words, the challenge of closing the skills gap is even bigger than she presented. Our rating Martin said only 50 percent of students from Milwaukee public high schools "go on to a two- or four-year college." Data backs her claim, though the method used dramatically understates how few students actually pursue higher education given the low graduation rate in MPS.

pomt-01080	"Georgia is now the eighth most populous state in the nation, moving from the number 10 position in just four years."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/16/nathan-deal/little-numbers-right-point/	Size matters. That was the implication in a recent round of news stories, touting Florida surpassing New York as the third most populous state. Overlooked in most coverage was Georgia’s move up, something Gov. Nathan Deal tried to rectify in his State of the State speech on Wednesday. "Georgia is now the eighth most populous state in the nation, moving from the number 10 position in just four years," Deal said. Political junkies know that with more people comes, at the very least, more Congressional seats. Or, as Deal would have it, evidence that a state is creating jobs and drawing top talent from around the nation. But looking at just the data, is Deal right on the numbers? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. The question of population falls to the U.S. Census Bureau, which in addition to conducting the decennial count that determines Congressional representation also releases annual population estimates for each state. The latest, pegged to July 1, estimated that 10,097,343 live in Georgia. That’s an increase of 102,584 from 2013, or a little bit larger than the city of Sandy Springs. It’s the first time Georgia reached the milestone of 10 million residents, and it puts the Peach State in 8th place among all states. That means Deal is right on the first part of his statement. But he’s off when comparing to four years ago, and the numbers from the 2010 Census. Way back when Betty White was a mere 88 years old, and "The Walking Dead" first showed what could happen to Georgia in a zombie apocalypse, the state had 9,687,653 people, Census data show. That put Georgia in ninth place in terms of population, just behind Michigan but one slot ahead of neighboring North Carolina. But what about Deal’s bigger point, that our growth is a signal of greater economic development? There, the same data can back him up. The 2014 Census data makes it look as if North Carolina surpassed Michigan in the latest counts. It did – but Georgia surged past Michigan first, said Robert Bernstein, a spokesman with the agency. "You’ll see it occasionally that a state will surpass another," Bernstein said. "What’s significant here is Michigan was leapfrogged twice, by both Georgia and North Carolina." Part of that shift is undoubtedly for jobs. The recent announcement that Mercedes-Benz USA will move its headquarters to metro Atlanta does not take people from Michigan, long the home to the nation’s auto industry. But it is another example of the gradual creation of the Southeast as the industry’s new hub. Chris Carr, the commissioner of Georgia’s Department of Economic Development, said Georgia had earlier lost out to Alabama for Mercedes’ new manufacturing plant. But the state left a good enough impression for the firm to consider it for its new headquarters, in part because Georgia’s growth is good for customers and workers alike, he said. "When companies are looking for a place to go, they need the right business climate but they want to make sure they are taking care of their employees and have a great place to live, too," Carr said. "There is a psychological impact that we are growing, that shows people there is a reason to be here," Carr said. That was the point Deal was trying to make, when he claimed Georgia is now the 8th most populous state and moved up two spots in just four years. The governor was off on the state’s ranking four years ago. We only moved up one spot. But he is right about where the state’s population is now – and how that population can tie to jobs.

pomt-12265	"There are so many data that demonstrate that poor people, surprisingly, are less likely to use drugs than people with means."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/07/gwen-moore/are-poor-people-less-likely-use-drugs/	Attending the People’s Summit, a three-day gathering in Chicago for organizations committed to social, racial and economic justice, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore spoke with the Real News Network, a nonprofit group that says it reports with "ordinary people’s interests in mind." The topic was poverty. Moore, a Milwaukee Democrat and former welfare recipient, blasted Republicans. Then she made a claim about poor people and drug use that we want to check. In the video interview, which went online June 19, 2017, she said: The Republicans have done a very good job of driving poor people into the underground, making people feel ashamed and guilty and feeling that they have some character flaws, based on their poverty. Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, is from my state -- as chairman of the Budget Committee; every year he was the chairman of the Budget Committee, I served on that committee. And so when he would roll out his pathways out of poverty initiatives -- this last time, he did it in front of a drug house. What is the equivalent between being poor and being a drug addict? None. There are so many data that demonstrate that poor people, surprisingly, are less likely to use drugs than people with means. I mean, they don't have money. They can’t afford it. Moore’s office did not respond to our call and emails asking for information to back her statement that poor people are less likely to use drugs. But the latest federal survey on the subject indicates the opposite of what she said. The research We posed Moore’s claim to the federal government’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, which cited the government’s latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health, done in 2015. Individuals age 12 and older were asked in in-person interviews in their homes if they had used illicit drugs in the past month. A spokeswoman for the institute told us that staff members used data obtained from the survey and found that a higher proportion of persons living in poverty used illicit drugs compared to persons with incomes at higher levels. Living in poverty Income up to 2 times the federal poverty threshold Income more than 3 times the federal poverty threshold Used any illicit drug in the past month 12.96% 11.4% 8.94% We also posed Moore’s claim to the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Institute for Research on Poverty. A staff member pointed us to studies that looked at employment and education, not income. But the results trended the same way. Among adults aged 18 or older, the rate of illicit drug use in the past month was higher among the unemployed (18.2 percent) than for those who were employed full time (9.1 percent) or part time (13.7 percent). That’s according to the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The same federal survey found that illicit drug use was higher among people who had not graduated from high school (11.8 percent) than high school graduates with no further education (9.9 percent), those with some college education (10.8 percent) and college graduates (6.7 percent). A footnote: Harold Pollack, a social service administration professor at the University of Chicago whose research specialties include poverty, told us about Moore’s claim: "I think that's a nuanced question," he said. "The data are much stronger that rich people are less likely to be punished for whatever drug use they engage in than that rich people use drugs more." Our rating Moore said: "There are so many data that demonstrate that poor people, surprisingly, are less likely to use drugs than people with means." The latest federal survey found that a higher percentage of people in poverty had used illicit drugs in the past month than people at higher income levels. Moore didn’t respond to our requests for information to back her statement. If other evidence available when Moore made her statement surfaces, we will revisit this item. In the meantime, we rate her statement False.	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2017-07-07T05:00:00	2017-06-19	['None']
pomt-11425	Says Democratic obstruction is the reason why "many important positions in government are unfilled."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/16/donald-trump/why-trump-appointments-have-lagged-behind-other-pr/	President Donald Trump has long blamed Democrats for moving his nominees through the Senate confirmation process at a sluggish pace. "Hundreds of good people, including very important ambassadors and judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate," Trump tweeted March 14. "Many important positions in government are unfilled because of this obstruction." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We ran the numbers, and Trump is certainly right on one count: Important government posts are empty. But allocating blame is more complicated than Trump suggests. Democrats bear some responsibility, but so do Senate Republicans and the Trump White House. By the numbers Compared with recent presidents, Trump has had the fewest nominees confirmed to date, according to the White House. Trump has also had the smallest percent of nominees confirmed by the Senate at this point in his presidency, relative to recent predecessors. Only 57 percent of Trump’s nominees have been confirmed, below that of Presidents Barack Obama (67 percent), George W. Bush (78 percent), Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush (each with 81 percent). See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that tracks political appointees, also found that Trump has seen fewer confirmations than recent presidents at this point. At an average rate of 81 days per confirmation, Trump’s nominees have also experienced significantly more lag time than those appointed by recent presidents. Of the roughly 1,200 positions that require Senate confirmation, the Partnership for Public Service has identified 640 "key positions" (excluding judicial and military appointments). Its latest data shows 144 key Trump nominees currently await Senate confirmation. So key government positions are unfilled. But who deserves the blame? Procedural combat Historically, senators routinely confirmed lower-level presidential nominees without much fanfare. But more recently, the Senate confirmation process has become a partisan battleground. In 2013, the Democratic-controlled Senate passed a measure to weaken Republicans’ ability to filibuster Obama’s nominees. Republicans responded with procedural combat. Now Democrats have answered in kind, putting even non-controversial nominees through the procedural gamut. Under the 2013 rule change, the number of votes required to break a filibuster of presidential nominees — through a process called cloture — was lowered from 60 to a simple majority of 51. But minority parties adopted new tactics. For instance, once the majority party breaks a filibuster through cloture, the minority party is allowed 30 additional hours of post-cloture debate — a procedural maneuver Democrats can use to drain the clock and bog down the confirmation process. "Floor time is the most precious commodity in the Senate and majority leaders are loath to lose time on nominations unless they are critical," said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. "The majority party must now triage its nominations by prioritizing which ones are worth spending the time on." According to the White House, Democrats have forced 78 cloture votes on Trump’s nominees. But experts stressed that not all Democratic obstruction should be viewed as simple partisan warfare. Legitimate concerns have surrounded some Trump nominees’ qualifications. They also noted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., could keep the Senate in session for more hours in order to mitigate the Democrats’ use of the cloture process. Democrat, Republican ‘holds’ Another procedural hurdle facing Trump nominees is the Senate "hold." The Senate generally operates on the principle of unanimous consent, so a single senator may seek to hold up an executive nominee by withholding consent. Ultimately, the decision to honor a hold request is up to the majority leader. Senate leaders typically grant these requests because to deny a hold creates alternative avenues for the senator to expend scarce floor time, according to the Congressional Research Service. Not surprisingly, Democrats have made use of this tactic. But Republican senators have also issued a significant number of holds as a way to extract concessions on various policy issues. (It’s difficult to make a systematic tally of which party is behind these delays because senators are not always required to publicly disclose holds.) One analysis found that of the eight published objections in 2017, four came from Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa. More intraparty holds have been placed in recent months, Politico reported in February, with at least 11 Republican senators publicly blocking nominees for the Energy, State and Justice departments, among other agencies. David Lewis, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University, pointed to the example of Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who has held up Justice Department nominees over differences with the Trump administration on marijuana policy. "It is certainly true that Democrats have used their institutional prerogatives to slow things down," Lewis said. "That said, Republicans have as well." White House role Ultimately, Trump shares the blame for the slimmed down federal workforce, experts said. As a starting point, it’s fair to ask how committed Trump is to staffing the government. The Partnership for Public Service, which tracks political appointees, notes that more than 200 key positions don’t even have nominees. Trump himself has suggested an understaffed bureaucracy might be more of a feature rather than a defect of his administration. He told Forbes in an October 2017 interview: "I'm generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be — because you don't need them," he says. "I mean, you look at some of these agencies, how massive they are, and it's totally unnecessary. They have hundreds of thousands of people." Burdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas, said whether Trump wants to fill out his ranks is a central question. "Trump doesn't necessarily believe in government, hence less pressure to fill slots," Loomis said. Yet even Trump’s good faith efforts to make executive appointments have been poorly managed, experts said. "He was slow out of the gate, and his vetting was poor due to poor planning and a poorly run Office of Presidential Personnel," Lewis said. "The president’s missteps early meant that he was always going to play catch up." Trump did nothing to smooth the process by alienating Democrats early on, Ostrander said. "One of Trump’s first acts as president was to ignore Democratic Party input and push through several controversial cabinet nominees as well as (Neil) Gorsuch for the Supreme Court," Ostrander said. "While President Trump broke no rules in doing so, these actions made Democrats in the Senate far less interested in working with the administration on future nominations." Experts noted that some of the delay is the result of legitimate concerns about Trump nominee qualifications and conflicts of interest, which has led to heightened scrutiny. "If the president were nominating persons with impeccable credentials, no conflicts of interest, and broad support, there would be not concerns about delays," Lewis said. "Instead, the president is choosing non-traditional nominees with complex financial holdings and often less expertise than they need." While Trump generally earned poor marks for his approach to bureaucratic nominations, his staffing of federal courts tells another story entirely. In this area, Trump has been energetic. Trump appointed more circuit court judges in his first year than any president in history, and ranked sixth overall in first-year federal judge appointments (trial court, appeals court and Supreme Court combined). Experts attributed this to better coordination between the White House and Senate on judges than executive appointments. Some suggested Republicans have simply made judicial appointments a higher priority. "I believe that Trump and his allies in the Senate have made the (correct) calculation that judicial nominations are simply worth more in the long run," Ostrander said. Our ruling Trump said Democratic obstruction is the reason why "many important positions in government are unfilled." There’s a lot of blame to go around for the federal government’s relatively modest headcount. Senate Democrats, adopting the upper chamber’s new norms, have engaged in procedural combat. Yet Senate Republicans have also held up Trump’s nominees to extract concessions. Finally, the Trump White House earns generally low marks for its approach to executive appointments.

pomt-10145	"John McCain voted against funding the troops because of . . . a timeline in it to draw down American troops."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/06/joe-biden/mccain-opposed-2007-war-funding-bill/	UPDATED: We updated this item on Oct. 6 and changed the ruling to True. See explanation at end. During an exchange with Sarah Palin in the St. Louis vice presidential debate on Oct. 2, 2008, Joe Biden tried to rebut a charge that Barack Obama had failed to "fund the troops" in Iraq by saying John McCain had done the same thing on a different bill. Palin began the exchange by saying that "Barack Obama voted against funding troops there after promising that he would not do so. And Senator Biden, I respected you when you called him out on that. You said that his vote was political and you said it would cost lives. And Barack Obama at first said he would not do that. He turned around under political pressure and he voted against funding the troops." Biden replied that Obama had offered a withdrawal plan that would shift responsibility to the Iraqis over the next 16 months and would draw down U.S. combat troops. As for the allegation about failing to fund the troops, Biden said, "John McCain voted the exact same way. John McCain voted against funding the troops because of an amendment he voted against had a timeline in it to draw down American troops. And John said I'm not going to fund the troops if in fact there's a timeline." Republicans candidates have charged that Obama "failed to fund the troops" because of his May 24, 2007, vote against an appropriations bill that included funding for the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. (It passed, 80-14.) We addressed that charge in this item and found it was misleading to say Obama did not want to fund the troops. We noted that Obama's primary reason was that the bill lacked a timetable for withdrawal. “We must fund our troops," he said at the time. "But we owe them something more. We owe them a clear, prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war. ... We must negotiate a better plan that funds our troops, signals to the Iraqis that it is time for them to act and that begins to bring our brave servicemen and women home safely and responsibly.” Biden's rebuttal in the vice presidential debate seems to be a reference to a war spending bill that first passed the Senate in March 2007. When Biden refers to an "amendment," we believe he was referring to the provision that would require a withdrawal of troops. And Biden is correct that McCain voted against the bill when it included that requirement. The bill, H.R. 1591 , included $97 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and set a goal to withdraw most U.S. troops in Iraq by 2008. It passed 51-47 but was opposed by most Republicans because of its timetable for withdrawal. McCain said he opposed the bill because it had been loaded with political pork and because it required a withdrawal regardless of conditions in Iraq. "Such a mandate would have grave consequences for the future of Iraq, the stability of the Middle East and the security of Americans at home and abroad. For these reasons, I do not support this bill," McCain said at the time. (The bill passed but was vetoed by President Bush.) Biden is right that McCain opposed a war spending bill. We find Biden's statement True. UPDATE: We originally rated Biden's statement Half True because, although McCain had issued a statement opposing the bill, he missed the vote on the bill on April 26, 2007. But after a reader called our attention to this vote, which occurred one month earlier, we changed our ruling to True.

pomt-06008	The U.S. military is at risk of losing its "military superiority" because "our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-navy-smallest-1917-air-force-s/	During the Jan. 16, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney took aim at President Barack Obama’s support for the U.S. military. "The most extraordinary thing that's happened with this military authorization is the president is planning on cutting $1 trillion out of military spending," Romney said. "Our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917. Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947. We are cutting our number of troops. We are not giving the veterans the care they deserve. We simply cannot continue to cut our Department of Defense budget if we are going to remain the hope of the Earth. And I will fight to make sure America retains military superiority." This comment includes a lot of separate claims, but after a number of readers contacted us, we decided to focus on two of them: "Our Navy is smaller than it's been since 1917," and, "Our Air Force is smaller and older than any time since 1947." His underlying point: The U.S. military has been seriously weakened compared to what it was 50 and 100 years ago. We’ll look at both the numbers as well as the larger context. But as you'll see below, using the number of military ships and airplanes is an outdated practice that one expert says "doesn't pass 'the giggle test.' " The Navy numbers The Romney campaign didn’t get back to us, but we found their likely sourcing when we contacted the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. In January 2010, Heritage published a report titled, "The State of the U.S. Military." Citing data from the Naval History and Heritage Command, a part of the Defense Department, the report said that "the U.S. Navy’s fleet today contains the smallest number of ships since 1916. The total number of active ships in the Navy declined from 592 to 283 between 1989 and 2009." We looked up the original data, and the Heritage report does reflect the trend line correctly (though Romney said 1917 rather than 1916, something we won’t quibble with). In 1916, the U.S. Navy had 245 active ships, a number that eventually peaked during World War II, then fell, then peaked again more modestly during the Korean War, followed by a slow, consistent decline over the next five decades. In recent years, the number of active ships has fallen low enough to approach its 1916 level. In both 2009 (the most recent year of the Heritage report) and 2011, the number was 285. So Romney has a point. However, even using this metric -- which, as we’ll argue later, is an imperfect one for measuring military strength -- this is not the lowest level since 1916. The same data set shows that during the years 2005 to 2008, the number of active ships was 282, 281, 278 and 282, respectively -- each of which were below the levels of 2009, 2010 and 2011. In other words, each of the final four years under George W. Bush saw lower levels of active ships than any of the three years under Obama. The number of surface warships also bottomed out in 2005 under Bush, later rising by about 10 percent under Obama. Such figures undercut Romney’s use of the statistic as a weapon against Obama. The Air Force numbers How about the Air Force? First, let’s look at the total number of aircraft. We found extensive data in a report titled, "Arsenal of Airpower: USAF Aircraft Inventory, 1950-2009," authored by retired Air Force Col. James C. Ruehrmund Jr. and Christopher J. Bowie and published in November 2010 by the Mitchell Institute, a research and analysis organization founded by the Air Force Association. The figures for 2009 show 5,988 total aircraft (4,460 active, 375 reserve and 1,153 in the Air National Guard). That’s a lower number than any year going back at least to 1950, the earliest year tallied in the report. So while we don’t have data going back to 1947, the specific year Romney cited, his claim about the size of the Air Force seems credible. (Figure 2 on page 5 of the Mitchell Institute report provides a good graphical representation of the numerical patterns over time.) Now, let’s look at the age of the Air Force’s assets. The Heritage report includes a chart titled, "The Oldest Air Force in U.S. History," referencing an October 2005 Government Accountability Office report, "DOD Needs to Identify and Address Gaps and Potential Risks in Program Strategies and Funding Priorities for Selected Equipment." We couldn’t find specific support in the GAO report for the claim that the Air Force of today (or, to be precise, the Air Force of 2005 when Bush was president) was the oldest since 1947. However, the report, combined with the analysis of experts we asked, suggest that it’s a fair conclusion. The GAO looked at 30 pieces of equipment from various branches (not just the Air Force) and found that "reported readiness rates declined between fiscal years 1999 and 2004 for most of these items. The decline in readiness, which occurred more markedly in fiscal years 2003 and 2004, generally resulted from (1) the continued high use of equipment to support current operations and (2) maintenance issues caused by the advancing ages and complexity of the systems." Charles Morrison, a researcher at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the U.S. "bought more aircraft in the early 1950s than in all the years combined from 1956 to 2011, clearly at the cost of an older fleet." So let’s sum up so far. On the number of naval ships, Romney is close, except that he overlooked the four years of lower numbers under Bush. Meanwhile, he’s correct on the number of aircraft and is most likely correct on the age of aircraft. Adding some context But what do those numbers mean? Not much, a variety of experts told us. Counting the number of ships or aircraft is not a good measurement of defense strength because their capabilities have increased dramatically in recent decades. Romney’s comparison "doesn’t pass ‘the giggle test,’ " said William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia. Consider what types of naval ships were used in 1916 and 2011. The types of ships active in both years, such as cruisers and destroyers, are outfitted today with far more advanced technology than what was available during World War I. More importantly, the U.S. Navy has 11 aircraft carriers (plus the jets to launch from them), 31 amphibious ships, 14 submarines capable of launching nuclear ballistic missiles and four specialized submarines for launching Cruise missiles -- all categories of vessels that didn't exist in 1916. As for the Air Force, many U.S. planes may be old, but they "have been modernized with amazing sensors and munitions even when the airframes themselves haven’t been," said Michael O’Hanlon, a scholar at the Brookings Institution. Human factors matter, too. "The vast superiority of the U.S. Air Force has little to do with number of planes, but with vastly superior training, in-flight coordination and control, as well as precision targeting and superior missiles," said Charles Knight, co-director of the Project on Defense Alternatives at the Massachusetts-based Commonwealth Institute. Ruehrmund and Bowie write in their report that "although the overall force level is lower, the capabilities of the current force in almost all respects far exceed that of the huge Air Force of the 1950s. Today’s Air Force can maintain surveillance of the planet with space and air-breathing systems; strike with precision any point on the globe within hours; deploy air power and joint forces with unprecedented speed and agility; and provide high-bandwidth secure communications and navigation assistance to the entire joint force." Increasingly crucial today are pilotless aerial vehicles, some of which are more commonly known as drones. "The Air Force now buys more unmanned than manned aircraft every year, and that trend is not going to change," said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University. "Within our lifetime, I think you’ll see an end to manned combat aircraft, because unmanned planes are more capable and a lot cheaper." For a sense of comparison, in 1947, "it took dozens of planes and literally hundreds of bombs to destroy a single target because they were so inaccurate," said Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "But thanks to smart bombs and stealthy aircraft, today it only takes a single plane and often a single bomb to destroy a target." Or as John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org, puts it: "Would anyone care to trade today's Navy or Air Force for either service at any point in the 20th century?" There’s also another problem with Romney’s claim. He appears to be throwing blame on Obama, which is problematic because military buildups and draw-downs these days take years to run their course. Just look at the long, slow declines in the number of ships and aircraft. These are not turn-on-a-dime events that can be pegged to one president. "Ships are so expensive that they have to be built over long periods of time, and at a pace that accounts for the retirement from service of other ships as well," Janda said. "We also have to space the building out over long periods of time to keep our major shipyards working at a rate that’s sustainable over several decades, because you can’t let them go under and then try to reform them in time of war. So Congress and the president make decisions each year regarding the needs of the Navy that do not come to fruition for decades, making it ridiculous to give blame or praise to the president for the current situation." All this said, there are lots of serious issues facing the military that Obama, or whoever defeats him in 2012, will have to address. One is the age of the Air Force’s assets, which is probably Romney’s strongest point. And despite the technological advantages of today’s military, there are limitations to having a smaller number of ships and aircraft. For instance, both branches, and especially the Navy, have to be able to position enough assets around the world where they are needed. And having a "small but sophisticated military is also risky," said Thomas Bruscino, a professor at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. "If the Navy loses one carrier to enemy action, for any reason, that loss would be catastrophic in a way such a loss would not have been in the past," Bruscino said. "Likewise, the Air Force cannot afford to lose even small numbers of the highly sophisticated airframes of today." Still, most experts we spoke to felt that Romney’s critique was misguided. Knight went so far as to offer this reply: "If Mr. Romney wants a truly stark example of diminished military capability, he should compare today’s horse cavalry to that in 1917, or even 1941 when there were still 15 active horse-cavalry regiments in the Army. Today there has been total disarmament of horse cavalry,’ he might say, ‘leaving our nation defenseless in this regard.’ His chosen comparisons are almost as absurd." Our ruling This is a great example of a politician using more or less accurate statistics to make a meaningless claim. Judging by the numbers alone, Romney was close to accurate. In recent years, the number of Navy and Air Force assets has sunk to levels not seen in decades, although the number of ships has risen slightly under Obama. However, a wide range of experts told us it’s wrong to assume that a decline in the number of ships or aircraft automatically means a weaker military. Quite the contrary: The United States is the world’s unquestioned military leader today, not just because of the number of ships and aircraft in its arsenal but also because each is stocked with top-of-the-line technology and highly trained personnel. Thanks to the development of everything from nuclear weapons to drones, comparing today’s military to that of 60 to 100 years ago presents an egregious comparison of apples and oranges. Today’s military and political leaders face real challenges in determining the right mix of assets to deal with current and future threats, but Romney’s glib suggestion that today’s military posture is in any way similar to that of its predecessors in 1917 or 1947 is preposterous. In addition, Romney appears to be using the statistic as a critique of the current administration, while experts tell us that both draw-downs and buildups of military equipment occur over long periods of time and can't be pegged to one president. Put it all together and you have a statement that, despite being close to accurate in its numbers, uses those numbers in service of a ridiculous point. Pants on Fire.

The initial blog post was published in April 2018 on the conspiracy-fueled website Disclose.tv. It popped up again this month on Facebook and has been shared more than 25,000 times, according to CrowdTangle data. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The man who supposedly invented this vehicle, Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso, first appeared in headlines in the corners of the internet in 2015. At the time, his company, Saith Technologies, held an "Open Day" where he debuted his inventions and products, according to Zimbabwean technology news site Techzim. The Zimbabwean news channel SABC Digital News also covered the event. All of the images on Saith’s Facebook and Twitter pages are from that event, as are all of the pictures of the inventions the company claims to have created. Neither account has been active since mid-2015. The Saith Technologies website appears to have been taken down. Chikumbutso claimed that his car runs on "5 normal gel batteries." According to an archived version of the Saith website, a secret substance is exposed to radio wavelengths, which give the car’s "power generator" the "capacity to funnel the power generated into functional electrical energy" and never require a recharge. Following the "Open Day" event, Techzim questioned the legitimacy of Saith Technologies products. It did not report on the company again. Techzim noted that Chikumbutso’s car was outside of the law of conservation of energy because it somehow converted 220 volt-producing gel batteries into a much higher output of 500,000 watts. "We are not sure how this assertion can be dispelled and we hope at some forum scientist [sic] will put the claims to test," the article read. The disclose.tv article says that the U.S. government "recently" relocated Chikumbutso to California to work on his inventions and that it might be to "control this type of invention." There is no evidence that this happened. Our ruling Three years ago, a man at a one-day event touted "inventions," including a car that defies the laws of physics. Since 2015, his story has only found a home on false news blogs and conspiracy sites. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-10-29T09:49:25	2018-04-26	['None']
pomt-00105	Says he didn't cancel a political rally because after Sept. 11, "the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-nyse-opened-day-after-911-it-did/	On the day a gunman killed 11 and wounded six others in a Pittsburgh synagogue, President Donald Trump twice defended his decision to hold a scheduled campaign rally by pointing to a rapid reopening of the New York Stock Exchange after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It did not happen the way he described. Trump first mentioned this rationale in an Oct. 27 address to the Future Farmers of America conference in Indianapolis: "I remember when we had the attack in Manhattan. We opened that stock exchange the next day; people were shocked. A great group of people — the head of the New York Stock Exchange is just a fantastic guy — Dick (Grasso). And he opened it up." Later that day, Trump kept his promise to hold a rally in Murphysboro, Ill. He repeated the anecdote in that address: "With what happened early today, that horrible, horrible attack in Pittsburgh, I was saying maybe I should cancel both this and that (the speech in Indianapolis). And then I said to myself, I remember Dick Grasso, a friend of mine, great guy. He headed up the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 11. And the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day. He said — and what they had to do to open it, you wouldn't believe. We won't even talk to you about it, but he got that exchange open. We can't make these sick, demented, evil people important." Here’s what really happened. The New York Stock Exchange didn’t open on the morning of the attacks, which hit the World Trade Center a few blocks away. The exchange building wasn't directly damaged, the Associated Press reported at the time, but "the surrounding neighborhood was littered with debris." The stock exchange didn’t open again until Sept. 17, 2001. Even a week after the attacks, conditions were hardly normal. At that point "rescue workers continued to search for survivors amid smoldering rubble," the AP reported, and "the smell of smoke still (hung) in the air — even permeating the NYSE trading floor." Trump does accurately remember Grasso’s involvement. As he rang the opening bell on Sept. 17, Grasso said, "Today, America goes back to business. We do it as a signal to those criminals who inflicted this heinous crime on America and all Americans, they have lost." According to the New York Times, "traders took subways instead of limousines, trudged on foot from the Staten Island Ferry, and began lining up at 7:30 outside the exchange to have their bags searched and ID tags checked." The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump said he didn't cancel a political rally because after the 9/11 attacks, "the New York Stock Exchange was open the following day." It wasn’t; the exchange didn’t open until a week later, on Sept. 17. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14473	Says "the New York Times can write a story that they know is false" yet "they can't basically be sued."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-ny-times-cant-be-sued-story-the/	Donald Trump has made little effort to hide his distaste for the media. In a typical comment, he said at one of his rallies in South Carolina that the media are "absolutely dishonest. Absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. Totally dishonest people." Now Trump is proposing changes to libel laws. On the Feb. 28, 2016, edition of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked the Republican presidential candidate to expand upon comments he’d made a few days earlier in Fort Worth, Texas -- that "one of the things I'm going to do if I win ... I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money." Trump replied, "Well, in England, I can tell you, it's very much different and very much easier. I think it's very unfair when the New York Times can write a story that they know is false, that they virtually told me they know it's false, and I say, why don't you pull the story, and they say, we're not going to do that, because they can't basically be sued. And you (Wallace) can't be sued because can you say anything you want, and that's not fair." Trump’s comments that media "basically can’t be sued" if they "write a story that they know as false" struck us as inaccurate, and when we checked with experts in media law, we found that current law already covers the situation Trump describes. (His campaign did not respond to two inquiries for this article.) One immediate problem with Trump’s assertion is that he said a publication can’t be sued for publishing an article known to be false. In reality, there’s no barrier to filing a lawsuit against a media outlet for libel. "It is relatively easy to sue" in a case like this, said Lyrissa Lidsky, a University of Florida law professor who has written about media law. Actually winning that lawsuit is a different matter, she added. Still, while libel lawsuits are typically hard to win under United States law, Trump happened to cite the main type of case in which the media outlet would be at serious risk of losing the case -- that is, when it published something defamatory that it knew to be false. Legal experts referred us to the unanimous 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan, which holds that the First Amendment generally protects even false statements about public officials and public figures -- but does not protect statements made with "actual malice," which means that the publication knew they were false and published the material anyway, or that they were published with reckless disregard to whether the material was true or false. "Under New York Times vs. Sullivan, the type of knowing lie that Mr. Trump describes is not protected by the First Amendment," said Leonard M. Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor and an attorney of counsel to the firm Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP. Roy S. Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, agreed that under Sullivan, "it is possible for a public-figure plaintiff to prove that the false statement was published either with knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard for its truth." Of course, the plaintiff in Trump’s example would have to do more than just assert their case -- they would have to prove it in court. "A public figure or public official must plead and prove actual malice," said Jane E. Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota. "If he or she does, then yes, he or she could prevail, absent some other defense." None of this is easy to do, of course, although someone like Trump would at least have significant resources to pursue such a case if he wished. In the real world, proving actual malice is "not impossible," said David Ardia, who codirects the University of North Carolina’s Center for Media Law and Policy. Ardia added that "if Trump were to win the presidency and attempted to change libel law to make it more favorable for public figures to win, he'd have to deal with the First Amendment, which provides robust protections for speech that is critical of public officials." Our ruling Trump said "the New York Times can write a story that they know is false" yet "they can't basically be sued." United States libel laws for public figures are indeed tilted toward media outlets and against plaintiffs. However, contrary to what Trump said, plaintiffs can always sue if they wish. And they can certainly win in the scenario Trump cited -- if the New York Times knowingly published something false and defamatory. Indeed, the seminal Supreme Court decision on this subject explicitly says that media outlets are not protected from libel suits if they knew something was false but published it anyway. We rate the statement False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-03-01T13:40:03	2016-02-28	['The_New_York_Times']
pomt-07612	Studies have shown that in the absence of federal reproductive health funds, we are going to see the level of abortion in Georgia increase by about 44 percent.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/22/hank-johnson/congressman-says-funding-decision-could-increase-a/	Federal budget wars have morphed into culture wars, and fiscal and social conservatives have set their sights on cutting family planning funds. The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted last month to take away $317 million in funds for the Title X program, which provides reproductive health services such as contraception and HIV testing for people who cannot afford it. Now the program’s fate lies with the Democratic-controlled Senate, and Title X defenders are launching a counterattack. In an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Lithonia Democrat, unleashed a statistic that could give even a staunch Title X critic pause. "Studies have shown that in the absence of Title X, we are going to see the level of abortion in Georgia increase by about 44 percent," Johnson said. Really? Title X serves at least 144,000 Georgians, of whom 139,000 are women. Federal rules bar those funds from being used for abortion. But anti-abortion advocates believe that revoking them would hurt groups such as Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions at some of its clinics. The House also voted to bar all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Johnson spokesman Andy Phelan sent us statistics from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research and policy group, to back up the congressman’s claim. Guttmacher’s roots lie in the movement to support abortion rights, but advocates on both sides of the abortion debate use its research to back their positions. Johnson’s paraphrase of Guttmacher’s research was right on. The institute’s Title X fact sheet for Georgia says, "In the absence of these services, the level of abortion in Georgia would be 44 percent higher." Methods to determine whether publicly funded family planning services reduce the number of unintended pregnancies have existed for "decades," said Guttmacher’s Jennifer Frost, a senior researcher and lead author of a 2008 paper about the group’s predictions. In the absence of affordable care, women tend to choose birth control methods that are less effective, Frost said. Since researchers cannot conduct actual experiments on what would happen if these services ended, Frost and her colleagues considered five types of behaviors -- ranging from switching contraceptive methods to dropping contraception all together -- that women might choose if funding disappeared. The research team knew from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data how often women who adopt these behaviors had unplanned pregnancies and abortions. It used this information for its projections. Nationally, abortions would rise by about one-third, the team predicted. Because Georgia women use Title X services at greater than the national rate, Guttmacher predicted a 44 percent increase here. In 2008, 39,820 women obtained abortions in Georgia, according to Guttmacher. We were unable to find another study on Georgia similar to Guttmacher’s, but its research does align with studies on the broader topic of how contraceptive use affects abortion rates. When contraception increases, the abortion rate generally declines, said Charles Westoff, a Princeton University professor who has compared data for dozens of countries. "It is obvious to most people that if the prevalence or availability of modern contraceptives is reduced, the unintentional pregnancy rate will rise and thus the abortion rate," Westoff said. Guttmacher may have underestimated the unintended pregnancies Title X averts, said Diana Greene Foster, a reproductive health expert at the University of California, San Francisco. She studied the group’s California numbers and thinks they are 20 percent too low. "I can’t say that their estimate of pregnancies averted for Georgia is too low by 20 percent. But I believe that in general, their methodology produces conservative estimates," Foster told PoltiFact Georgia in an e-mail. University of Alabama professor Michael New, whose research is widely used to support anti-abortion positions, says Guttmacher’s figures are unpersuasive. New cited a 2002 Guttmacher study on women who had abortions. Of those who did not use contraceptives, 12 percent said they could not afford or gain access to them. This low percentage suggests Title X has little effect on abortions, New said. That same study, however, also found that women with lower income and education levels are less likely to use contraception, and those who use no contraception are more likely to have abortions. New also cited a Guttmacher analysis of abortion statistics in 13 countries. Abortions declined in seven of those countries after modern contraception became popular, but they initially rose in the U.S. and five other countries. Still, in the U.S. and at least three other countries where abortions increased, abortion rates eventually declined. Did Johnson get his facts right? Johnson said "studies" show Georgia’s abortion level would increase by 44 percent. In fact, he cited a single study from a widely respected group. While scholars have found that in general, increases in the use of contraceptives lead to decreases in abortion, and one expert said Guttmacher may have underestimated its Georgia figures, we found no other study that confirms or refutes its conclusions about this state. Johnson would have been right if he said that studies show contraception decreases abortion, and that without Title X funds, abortions could rise. But he didn’t. We therefore rate his statement Half True.	None	Hank Johnson	None	None	None	2011-03-22T06:00:00	2011-03-09	['None']
pomt-08387	Says Gov. Jim Doyle and the DNR have not put hunters first and mismanaged the deer herd; as a result "the deer population has dwindled."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/24/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-dnr-has-mismanaged-states-deer-h/	Scott Walker’s first deer hunting expeditions gave him a taste of the frustration that has been felt by many Wisconsin hunters: He got skunked. Now, in his bid for governor, Walker has waded into the single most contentious state natural resources issue: the size of the state’s deer herd and how the balance is struck between the wishes of hunters, the effects of deer on the environment, the concerns of farmers and the safety of drivers. The annual deer hunt helps drive tourism and, for many, helps define Wisconsin. Walker, a Republican facing Democrat Tom Barrett in the Nov. 2, 2010 election, is a recent hunter, though his story may have a common ring to it. Two years ago, on his first hunt, he saw a buck but couldn’t shoot, because he was in an area where hunters first had to kill a doe before they could shoot a buck. Last year’s hunt was equally unsatisfying: Walker didn’t see a deer. Walker made increasing the number of deer -- and the number of hunters -- a central part of a tourism plan he unveiled Oct. 14, 2010. In the three-page document, Walker says Gov. Jim Doyle and the state Department of Natural Resources have engaged in "political games" and "put bureaucrats in Madison ahead of hunters of the state." The result, he argues, is a smaller herd, fewer deer taken and fewer hunters. In a news release, Walker claimed that the "deer population has dwindled" as a result of "mismanagement" by Doyle and the DNR. That’s the statement we put in our cross hairs. Is it true the deer population has dwindled? And, if so, is the frustration of hunter a result of political games and mismanagement in Madison? We started with Walker, but his campaign said he was unavailable to talk to PolitiFact Wisconsin about the matter. Out hunting votes, no doubt. The campaign referred us to adviser Greg Kazmierski, a member of the Hunters Rights Coalition, a lobbying group and longtime critic of the DNR. Kazmierski, owner of Buck Rub Outfitters Ltd. in the Town of Delafield, believes the DNR’s system of managing the deer herd -- and the hunt -- is out of whack. His list of complaints is long: Deer population estimates, used to establish hunting targets, are "not anywhere close to accurate"; the department itself doesn’t do enough to encourage hunting and is "anti-hunter"; bureaucrats focus too much on other factors, such as car-deer accidents and farmers who have their crops damaged. "We are moving in a direction that people want to give (hunting) up," said Kazmierski, whose business is based on hunting. "There are too many rules and regulations." OK, let’s dig into the claim, starting with the last word: "dwindled." The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines dwindle as "To become steadily less: shrink." That can apply to the deer population in the state -- which is estimated at 1.3 million -- down from about 1.8 million in 2007. But Walker’s statement glosses over two critical factors. First, the population is an estimate -- no one knows exactly how many deer there are. Second, the numbers are down on purpose; the smaller herd is part of a policy compromise that involves many players and in some years a vote by the Legislature. Under state law, the DNR must establish a "post-hunt" deer population goal. Once every three years, that goal is voted on and approved by state lawmakers. It is not a decision for bureaucrats or the governor alone -- as Walker suggests when he blames them for mismanagement. Everything starts with estimates of the overall deer herd -- an inexact science, but one that the state was praised for as a national leader in a 2006 review by out of state experts. The DNR also receives advice from various groups and sportsmen in each county, via members of the Wisconsin Conservation Congress, a statewide network that has existed for 76 years. The prospects for hunters are far from the only consideration that plays into the target deer population. When there are large numbers of deer, farmers complain of damage to their crops. In suburban areas, deer begin to show up, wandering in cul-de-sacs and backyards. And, of course, some become part of car-deer accidents. For instance, as the number of deer has declined, so has the number of car-deer accidents: 16,338 in 2009, down from 17,555 in 2005 and 19,914 in 2001. But after a disappointing 2009 hunt, many hunters blamed the DNR. The post-hunt goal for the fall 2010 hunt was set last spring at about 794,000. That compares with a post-hunt goal of about 706,000 in 2005 and a post-hunt goal of about 704,000 in 2000. So, while Walker argues the overall population is dwindling, the post-hunt goal has actually been increasing. This year, a special committee recommended setting the post-hunt deer population at 745,636. The agency bumped it to 794,172, after taking into account that some members of the committee -- including Kazmierski -- wanted a goal in excess of 1 million. Let’s look at some other numbers, which also relate to Walker’s claim -- that tourism is being harmed because the number of hunters is down. Number of Wisconsin hunters: Licensed resident deer hunters were 800,372 in 2009, according to the DNR. That’s down 1,513 from the year before. But the number is up from 2005, when it was 780,719. Number of out-of-state hunters: Non-resident licenses were 43,998 in 2009, down 1,575 -- about 3.5 percent -- from the year before. Out of state licenses totalled 42,397 in 2005. Total deer harvest: In 2009, the total was 329,103, down 124,377 from the year before and 134,832 less than in 2005. With that drop, it’s no wonder many hunters are frustrated. In 2009, there were 39 deer killed per 100 licensed hunters, compared with 56 deer per 100 hunters in 2005. However, the percentage of successful hunters is actually even lower, because many hunters bag more than one deer. Walker’s plan calls for the governor to appoint "white tail deer trustee" (We think "deer overseer" is a bit more poetic) to advise the state on deer management. What do others say about the issue? -- "The deer herd is down, but it’s not decimated. It’s down, but it’s coming back," said Mark Toso, president of the Wisconsin Deer Hunters Association, a group he says has 1,000 members. Toso said Walker is "trying to feed off of anti-DNR sentiment" and frustration among hunters: "A lot of deer hunters only know what they see in the woods. If they don’t see a deer, it’s the DNR’s fault." -- Ed Harvey, chairman of the Conservation Congress, said the group was formed precisely to "depoliticize" deer management. He noted: "If something’s politicized, it’s a lobbying group." He said the DNR has erred in estimated deer counts in some parts of the state, leading to hunter frustration: "The department has taken some very big strides to correct that. It will take some time." Asked about the deer trustee advisor, Harvey’s response was simple: "That’s what the Congress does." -- "In my professional opinion, the statement that the deer herd has been mismanaged is wrong," said Tim Van Deelen, a University of Wisconsin-Madison biology professor and expert on deer populations. He noted the 2006 audit that found the state’s approach to counting the herd more rigorous than that of other states: "When I consider the totality of the information available, I don't think the deer herd has dwindled -- decreased somewhat, maybe, but not substantially." OK, let’s get out of the woods. Walker points to "political games" by Doyle and the DNR, whom he blames for the state’s "dwindling" deer population. That view is certainly shared by many frustrated hunters. However, Walker’s statement leaves out critical information: The size of the deer herd, itself an estimate, is down by design, not by mistake. The goals are based on a system built on input from across the state and attempt to balance the concerns of hunters against those of farmers and drivers. Indeed, it has been successful in helping reduce the number of car-deer accidents. What’s more, in response to pressure from hunters, the 2010 population goal was increased. We rate Walker’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02285	This is the first time since World War II that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/04/chain-email/were-five-aircraft-carriers-docked-one-place-2014-/	A chain email says that President Barack Obama was irresponsible to order five first-line aircraft carriers into Norfolk Naval Base together -- purportedly the first time this had been done since World War II. Readers asked us to look into the email, which raised the specter of Pearl Harbor and implied that there may have been an ulterior motive on Obama’s part. So we decided to check it. (A hat tip to Snopes.com, the urban-legend website, which has also rated this claim.) Accompanied by a photograph of five aircraft carriers docked together, the email begins, "What’s wrong with this picture? The picture is of the five first line U.S. nuclear carriers docked together in one place. Just like Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941. This picture was taken February 2014 in Norfolk, Va. . . Obama ordered five nuclear carriers into harbor for ‘routine’ (?) inspections. Heads of the Navy were flabbergasted by the directive but had to comply as it was a direct order from their commander-in-chief." It continues, "This is the first time since WWII that five nuclear-powered aircraft carriers were docked together. USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, USS George H.W. Bush, USS Enterprise, USS Harry S. Truman and USS Abraham Lincoln are all in port at Naval Station in Norfolk, Va., the world’s largest naval station." Let’s start with the picture. The photograph is genuine -- the five carriers were indeed docked at Norfolk Naval Base at the same time -- but the email gets much of the context wrong. The picture was taken in December 2012, not February 2014, as the email claims. The email is also wrong about why the carriers were there. They were not docked for "routine inspections" -- they were brought to shore so that crew members could spend Christmas with their families. Intercepts, a defense news blog, reported in a Dec. 20, 2012, post that the Navy "makes a point" of trying to give its crew a chance to spend Christmas with their families, "and for a few days the percentage of ships underway drops to the lowest point it will be all year." What about this being the first time since World War II that five nuclear carriers were docked together? The quick answer is that December 2012 was not the first time since the war that five nuclear powered aircraft carriers were docked at the same place at the same time. A similar unintentional gathering took place at Norfolk in July 1997. A July 2, 1997, Associated Press article published in the Daily Press of nearby Newport News, Va., reported that "for the first time" all five Norfolk-based nuclear-powered aircraft carriers will be "moored at their home port." The Navy spokesman at the time, Mike Maus, addressed this rare grouping. "It just worked out that way," Maus said. "There was no plan to say, ‘Let’s bring all the carriers in for the Fourth of July.’ Between scheduling for normal routine operations and shipyard stuff, that’s how it happened to fall into place." The AP reported in 1997 that the Navy doesn’t consider having all five carriers in port at the same time to be a security risk. "At this particular time," Maus said, "we don’t really have much of a threat from anybody." What about Obama’s role in the carriers’ placement? Dictating the day-to-day locations of aircraft carriers is "not really something the commander-in-chief deals with," said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org. Our ruling A chain email says Obama ordered five aircraft carriers into Norfolk Naval Base together in 2014, supposedly the first time this had been done since World War II. But the rendezvous occurred in 2012, a similar grouping happened at the base in 1997, and it was done so that naval personnel could be with their families for the Christmas holiday -- not for nefarious reasons that posed a security risk.

pomt-03813	Says of 80,000 people who were denied a firearm in 2012 due to a failed background check, only 44 were prosecuted.	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/mar/22/kelly-ayotte/most-people-trying-buy-gun-illegally-us-senator-ke/	Before Congress enacts any new gun control laws, the nation’s law enforcement officers and courts should better enforce the regulations they have on the books now, according to U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte. In a meeting with the Telegraph editorial board, New Hampshire’s junior senator took aim last month at the national background check system, which does not go far enough prosecuting those who illegally try to obtain weapons, she said. "Of approximately 80,000 in 2012 that were denied (a gun) because of a background check … only 44 people were prosecuted for that," Ayotte said during the February 19 meeting. "That surprised me," she said. "I want to look further at what we’re doing in terms of enforcement." If Ayotte’s numbers are right, the nation’s .055 prosecution rate doesn’t make for a very good shooting percentage. So, we decided to run the numbers ourselves. But first, some background. According to federal figures, most applicants who are denied a firearm through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System are rejected because of a prior criminal conviction, restraining order or another past issue. In almost every case, these people can be prosecuted. Here’s why: Firearms dealers, who provide the federal application form, are instructed to immediately turn away applicants if they acknowledge a past conviction or other prior issue, even before they conduct the FBI check. Applications that are submitted to the FBI and later rejected are typically denied because the applicant failed to acknowledge their record on the initial form, which can qualify as a federal crime for providing false information. In rare cases, an applicant might initially succeed in obtaining a firearm, despite a criminal record. But once the background check returns showing their past convictions, they could face charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Now, on to the numbers. Reached for comment, Ayotte’s staff pointed us in the direction of U.S. Attorney Timothy Heaphy. Earlier this winter, Heaphy, who represents the western district of Virginia, presented those numbers to members of the Senate judiciary committee during a Feb. 12 hearing on gun violence. In his testimony, Heaphy cited research published recently by the U.S. Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Regional Justice Information Service, a Missouri-based group that provides research for the justice department, among other public safety and governmental agencies. The information service’s research supports Ayotte, and Heaphy’s numbers, showing 80,191 applications denied, along with 44 active prosecutions. But, these numbers are based on 2010 data, not 2012, as Ayotte and Heaphy claimed, and reflect only a portion of the total national figures, according to Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the information service. . The 80,191 figure, reported in a February study titled "Background Checks for Firearm Transfers, 2010," includes only those applications denied by state and local permitting agencies, Frandsen said. Under the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, gun shop owners and other licensed authorities in many states -- 21 to be exact, including New Hampshire -- conduct at least a portion of the background checks themselves through the FBI’s background check system. Agencies in these states conducted about 4.37 million checks in 2010, leading to the 80,191 denials, according to Frandsen’s report. But, those 29 states that do not conduct the checks themselves defer instead to the FBI to do so. In 2010, the FBI conducted about 6.04 million checks, 72,659 of which were denied, Frandsen noted in the study. That places the total number of denied checks conducted in 2010 at 152,850 -- about 1.5 percent of the checks conducted. Now on to the prosecutions count. A separate report, "Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2010," published by Frandsen in August, counts 62 charges filed across the country by U.S. Attorneys in 2010, most for falsifying when buying firearms (22) and possession of firearms by a convicted felon (11). Of those 62 charges, 18 were dropped that year, leaving 44 cases intact, according to Frandsen’s report. That number equals Ayotte’s claim. But, once again, it tells only part of the story. The 44 charges, 13 of which were still pending at the end of 2011, reflect only those cases brought by federal prosecutors and does not consider charges filed by state or local police agencies, Frandsen noted. In his research, Frandsen tracks those local cases reported voluntarily by states. In 2010, four states -- Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- reported 1,520 arrests. That count does not include any arrests made that year in the remaining 17 states that conduct at least some background checks themselves. "You’d have to say (the total number of arrests) would be higher," Frandsen said. "There’s no question." Our ruling: On the numbers, Ayotte is on track. In one year, more than 80,000 background checks were denied at the state and local level and federal authorities pursued 44 charges in court, as the senator claimed. However, the report she cited is based on 2010 numbers, not 2012, but that’s small potatoes. More to the point, Ayotte confuses state and federal numbers in her statement, using state rejections (80,000) and federal prosecutions (44). Looking at state enforcement alone, just four states had more than 1,500 arrests. While those are arrests, not prosecutions, it stands to reason the number of state prosecutions is vastly higher than the figure Ayotte cited. That ratio is not nearly as dramatic as Ayotte suggested, but her larger point remains valid: the majority of failed background checks do not lead to criminal charges or prosecutions. With this in mind, we rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Kelly Ayotte	None	None	None	2013-03-22T14:46:02	2013-02-19	['None']

"Dying 78 year old CIA agent admits to killing Marilyn Monroe" read the headline on Science Vibe, a website that claims to share stories from scientific breakthroughs to the seemingly impossible. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. There are many things wrong with the post. First, the supposed ex-CIA officer Normand Hodges is made up. The photo of "Hodges" is actually a man named Michael Tyrrell taken from a 2013 Guardian article about prisoners in hospitals. The Science Vibe article presents the reasoning behind why Marilyn Monroe became a security threat is because she had supposedly slept with Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro making her susceptible to exposing strategic information to communists. While there are conspiracy theories surrounding the relationships of Monroe and the truth behind her death ruled by police as a probable suicide, there is no evidence that she was murdered in part of a cover-up. When we tried to search for the quotes attributed to Hodges, we found no results or credible sources for them. We also found this story circulated by several other hoax sites.

pomt-11526	About New York state: "We have the highest debt per capita."	true	/new-york/statements/2018/feb/16/edward-cox/new-york-state-leads-country-government-debt-resid/	State Republican Chairman Edward F. Cox says New York state’s debt per person is higher than any other state. "We have the highest debt per capita," Cox said at a debate among three Republican candidates for governor. The claim comes among a string of criticisms from state Republicans against the economic record of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Cox recently claimed that unemployment was up in every county in the state outside New York City. We rated that claim Mostly True. State Sen. John DeFrancisco, a GOP candidate for governor, claimed that one-third of New York state’s population is on Medicaid. That’s True. But there’s also evidence the state’s economy has improved since Cuomo took office. The state has more private sector jobs than ever before, and unemployment has dropped statewide. So what about the debt? It is one of the few economic indicators for the state we haven’t looked at. Is Cox’s claim correct? Government debt per capita A spokesperson for Cox said he was talking about debt incurred by state and local governments, not personal debt like credit cards or auto loans. New York state ranked highest in government debt for residents in 2015, the latest data available. The debt per person was $17,528 in New York state, according to the Empire Center. The center is a non-partisan, non-profit think tank based in Albany that calls for policy reforms based on free-market principles, personal responsibility and effective and accountable government. It used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis to calculate the rate for each state. The next highest state was Massachusetts, with government debt at $13,733 per person. Wyoming had the lowest rate, with $3,376 of government debt per person. New York state has ranked highest each year since Cuomo took office in 2011. Government debt was $17,204 per capita in New York state that year, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning tax policy and finance analysis organization. Our ruling Cox said "We have the highest debt per capita." The latest data proves Cox’s claim. New York state has had the highest state and local government debt per capita since at least 2011.

Nova magazine published an article on Nov. 27 with a clickbait headline that is not just speculation but a false statement. The headline reads: "Prince Harry says Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding: ‘Trump is a serious threat to human rights.’ " (Later, the headline was changed to read, "Donald Trump Not Welcome At Prince Harry’s Wedding To American Actress: Trump Is A ‘Serious Threat To Human Rights.’ " We’re evaluating the original headline.) Harry and Meghan became engaged earlier in November but announced their engagement on Nov. 27. Very few details have been released about the wedding, other than it will take place in Spring 2018. There is no record of Prince Harry uninviting Trump, nor is it likely that he would. The royal family typically tries to shy away from drama. The royal family has put out two press releases regarding the engagement, and neither mention an invite list. The Obamas were not invited to Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding in 2011. The other quote in the title, "Trump is a serious threat to human rights," is from reporting done in an Us Weekly article. Us Weekly said a "close source" told them that Harry "is not a fan" of Trump and thinks he "is a serious threat to human rights." But that source was anonymous and we don’t find it credible. The Nova article said that Markle called Trump "misogynistic" and joked about moving to Canada (where Suits is filmed) if he were elected. Markle did say that, on a panel she participated on for Comedy Central’s Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore on May 4, 2016. It seems unlikely that Trump will be invited to the royal wedding. But Harry never made a statement about it, nor did he say that Trump was a serious threat to human rights. Such a statement would have garnered worldwide headlines. We rate the claim that Harry said Trump was not welcome to the royal wedding as Pants on Fire.

pomt-14955	Brewpubs can't sell growlers of their beer to customers.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/oct/23/slice-pint-brewpub/brewpub-growling-about-state-craft-beer-sales/	At least one Georgia beer maker is frothing mad about the new legislation regulating local suds’ sales and is using his menu to make the point. At the Slice & Pint brewpub in Emory Village, brewmaster Crawford Moran has launched a "government rant" series of beers designed to highlight his gripes. The menu’s fall offering: "Why does the state legislature not want to create jobs by allowing us to do growlers of this IPA?" Alas, growler shops - that sell the glass jugs that hold a half gallon of beer - dot the landscape from Decatur to Alpharetta. So your PolitiFact Georgia scribe ordered a pint – even Beerack, er, Barack Obama knows the value of a good beer summit – and settled in to research whether the state’s brewpubs can’t sell their products to go. Bitter brew Georgia’s history of direct beer sales to consumers is a bitter one. Craft brewers have sought for at least a decade to change the state law that keeps them from making money from those who want to quaff their wares. In this year’s legislative session, Senate Bill 63 originally would have given breweries and brewpubs their wish. But the final version instead gave craft brewers the ability only to sell tours and give away their product – a backdoor way to sell limited amounts of beer to go - and stripped out brewpubs’ ability to do the same. Controversy is brewing over that change, now that the state Department of Revenue has issued a bulletin forbidding brewers from charging different prices for the tours based on the value of the beers offered. And brewpubs? The law makes it clear they must sell only on site or to wholesale dealers – the middleman that direct sales would avoid. "We have had so many people come in, locals, students, parents and they love our beer and want to take some home with them," said Moran, who co-owns the Slice and Pint and two locations of the 5 Seasons brewpub. "But the state legislature said those people can’t buy beer where they want to. It’s hard to take." It’s also hard to pin down. Nancy Palmer, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, agreed the hard line in SB 63 says brewpubs cannot sell their product to go. But hypothetically, she said, brewpubs could sell a growler of beer that they did not produce on site. That’s because the state license for alcohol sales applies to bars, package stores and brewpubs alike and allows for sales both on and off premise. "As far as the state is concerned, you could walk around Kroger drinking beer," Palmer said. "Of course, Kroger doesn’t allow that. And local governments are the ones who decide if they will allow on- or off-site sales." Decatur, for instance, allows people to buy growlers to go from growler shops – and also sample in the store. But Slice & Pint sits outside the city limits and wouldn’t qualify for that perk because it is both a retail operation, like a growler shop, and a manufacturer, by making beer. Moran’s operation is also unique in that he rejects selling to a wholesaler. The state has just 12 other brewpubs, Palmer said, and all sell to that middleman, who can then make it available to go at package stores and the like. Rules on the Department of Revenue website confirm use of wholesalers, as does the new legislation. A spokesman for the department declined to comment. Our ruling A brewpub owner in DeKalb County has created a series of beers designed to call attention to what his says is the state’s interference between his business and consumers. The IPA in question effectively claims that brewpubs can’t sell their products to go. A new state law is clear that neither brewpubs nor breweries can make those sales. The brewpub does have the option to sell to wholesalers, who can then make the suds available to consumers. But that is not the same thing as getting a growler to go with your pizza.

Rick Scott’s re-election campaign has not been afraid to exploit is how many Floridians lost their jobs during Charlie Crist’s term as governor. During the Oct. 10 Telemundo debate in Miramar, Scott noted about a half dozen times that 832,000 people joined the ranks of the unemployed while Crist was in office. Scott spent much of the debate blaming Crist for worsening conditions during the new Democrat’s term, but he kept coming back to jobs. "You want to talk about jobs – Charlie, 832,000 people lost their job while you were governor." Jobs numbers have been a major talking point for the current governor as far back as his 2010 campaign, when he first promised to bring 700,000 jobs -- and then up to 1.7 million jobs -- to the state over seven years. Our Scott-O-Meter says that promise is In The Works. Scott also said the state lost 825,000 jobs under Crist, a claim we rated Half True in 2012, because Crist, like any governor caught in the midst of a recession, had little control over job losses. At the debate, Scott offered a slightly larger figure -- 832,000. Is this number accurate? PolitiFact Florida took a closer look. Numbers game If you’ve followed what we’ve written on this question over the years, you’ve no doubt noticed that the numbers change from time to time. Economists regularly revise these numbers based on new information. Further complicating matters, Scott’s campaign website has cited private-sector job losses of 828,800 under Crist, specifically from January 2007, when Crist took office, to December 2010, Crist’s last month in office. Understanding the different time spans being measured, and what exactly they are measuring, helps explain the nuances of this claim. First of all, we’ll note that there’s a difference between private-sector jobs and all jobs; the main difference with the latter is that it includes government jobs. For the same months as Scott’s chart -- January 2007 through December 2010 -- the BLS reports that Florida lost 822,200 private-sector jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis (a process that smooths out month-to-month comparisons). The number for total nonfarm job losses during the same time period, seasonally adjusted, was 836,700. So where is the Scott campaign getting 832,000? They changed the time frame to between December 2006 -- the month before Crist took office -- and December 2010. In that case, the total for seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs was 832,700. The reason the number decreased is because the number jobs went up slightly between December 2006 and January 2007. This means the December calculation starts from a lower baseline than the January calculation. When we measured private-sector jobs -- which, incidentally, is the kind that Scott routinely touts for his own record, perhaps because the numbers look rosier for him -- we came up with a loss of 819,600 over the same period. In the big picture, the magnitude of the difference isn’t all that great. The 832,700 figure is only 1.5 percent bigger than the 819,600 figure. Whichever number you choose, these job losses don’t look good. Where Crist has some cover is that he’s hardly the primary reason for these job losses. Experts have consistently told PolitiFact Florida that it's hard to tell how much influence the governor of any one state has on job losses (or -- sorry, Gov. Scott -- job creation). It may take years to find out whether policies have had any effect on job totals at all. Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics who studies Florida, noted back in 2012 that by the time Crist took office in 2007, "the seeds of destruction" had already been sown. An overheated housing market and dirty dealings in the lending industry had long been entrenched problems. "That had very very little to do with Charlie Crist," Lafakis said. Our ruling Scott said "832,000 people lost their job" while Crist was governor, blaming his opponent for not doing enough while in office to improve Florida’s growing ranks of the unemployed. It’s possible to quibble with the specific number of job losses that occurred under Crist, but the differences are small -- 1.5 percent in one direction or the other. The bigger issue is that it’s a stretch for Scott to ascribe blame for job losses on a governor’s watch, since it’s unclear whether any given governor’s policies have had an effect on employment trends. If Scott is trying to impugn Crist’s record on jobs during a recession -- something that depends heavily on the national and international economic picture -- he’s largely off base, even if his numbers are pretty close. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-10-10T16:37:57	2014-10-10	['Charlie_Crist']
pomt-10078	If Obama's economic plan creates 600,000 new government jobs, "that's about the size of the post office work force."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/05/mitch-mcconnell/postal-service-employs-just-over-600000/	President-elect Barack Obama has used a lot of big numbers when it comes to a major stimulus bill to jolt the economy back to life. The bill has to be big if it's going to work, Obama has said. "Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we don’t act swiftly and boldly, we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double-digit unemployment and the American Dream slipping further and further out of reach," Obama said during a radio address on Jan. 3, 2009. The next day on the Sunday morning show This Week with George Stephanopoulos , Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell sounded a cautionary note, saying that Republicans will carefully vet Obama's plans. "We want to make sure it's not just a trillion-dollar spending bill, but something that actually can reach the goal that he has suggested," McConnell said. Stephanopoulos countered, "So how do you do that?" McConnell: "Well, let me make some suggestions. First of all, the incoming president, has said he would like for 80 percent of the jobs created to be in the private sector. Well, do we really want to create 20 percent of the jobs in the public sector? That would be 600,000 new government jobs. That's about the size of the post office work force. Is that a good idea? That's something that strikes us that we ought to take a look at." Stephanopoulos: "You don't think it is?" McConnell: "Well, it may not be, but I think, at least, hearings, and some kind of bipartisan considerations would be helpful." We wondered two things: whether McConnell was accurately characterizing Obama's plan for public sector jobs, and whether that would result in an additional work force rivaling the size of the U.S. Postal Service. It turns out McConnell was right in his characterization of Obama's plan. Obama said in the radio address from the day before that "the No. 1 goal of my plan" is to "create 3 million new jobs, more than 80 percent of them in the private sector." To us, that seems like 20 percent of the jobs could then be in the public sector. Simple math tells us that 20 percent of 3 million is 600,000. Granted, Obama's words clearly allow some wiggle room. Maybe more than 80 percent would be in the private sector, reducing the number of public sector jobs. Nevertheless, the 80 percent minimum sounds like a benchmark to us. Obama also says that the jobs will be "new," which means they will be additions to the current work force. So when McConnell says that Obama wants to add "600,000 new government jobs," that sounds like a fair reading of Obama's words. Then McConnell added, "That's about the size of the post office work force." The number of U.S. Postal Service employees is in that ballpark. But you can crunch the numbers a few different ways. In its year-end report for 2008, the postal service reported that it employed 663,238 career employees as of Sept. 30, 2008. It also employed an additional 101,850 temporary or part-time workers, which would bring its total to 765,088. The Postal Service says that it’s the second-largest employer in the United States after Wal-Mart, which employs 1.4 million in the United States, though that number includes many part-timers. Getting back to the postal comparison, McConnell is not far off with his comparison if you count only the 663,238 career employees. If you included the temporary workers, the margin of difference becomes more significant. But we suspect Obama wants to create full-time jobs with benefits, not add temporary or part-time workers. So we offer a few minor caveats to McConnell's statement. Obama implied he would create 600,000 new public-sector employees at most, and the postal service is just a little bit bigger than 600,000. But McConnell is largely correct in what he says. We rate his statement Mostly True. UPDATE: Obama offered new job numbers for his stimulus plan during his weekly radio address on Jan. 9, 2009. His economic advisers believe the stimulus plan will create between 3 million and 4 million jobs, with at least 90 percent in the private sector, Obama said. The advisers' report estimates that 3.675 million jobs will be created, and that 244,000 of those will be government jobs — a much lower number than the size of the U.S. Postal Service. But McConnell was correct at the time he made his statements, so our ruling stands.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2009-01-05T17:27:10	2009-01-04	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-04743	Says women care most about jobs and the economy	true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/29/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-says-women-care-most-about-jobs-and-econ/	Women and Mitt Romney see more eye-to-eye on the issues than the polls and press would have you believe, says Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. As the Republican National Convention convened in Tampa, CNN host Wolf Blitzer asked Bondi if she thought debate over abortion rights played into why Obama leads Romney with women. He pointed out the party’s policy platform, which calls for a "personhood"-style amendment that would define life at the moment of conception. Bondi said "that issue really has not come up" during her travels across the country on Romney’s behalf. "What women care about are jobs, the economy, the unemployment rate," Bondi said on Aug. 27, 2012. "You know, 401,000 women have lost jobs under President Obama’s reign." Later in the interview, she said, "Wolf, when I’m around the country, women care about the same issues as men, and that’s getting jobs, keeping jobs." We’ve heard this retort from Republicans throughout this election cycle as reproductive rights issues have at times dominated the news. We wanted to know if Bondi is right about jobs being the priority for women or if it just sounds nice on TV. We put the question to experts in polling, political science and women’s issues (and to Bondi’s press aides, who did not respond). Women have trended Democratic since the Ronald Reagan-Jimmy Carter 1980 election, but abortion isn’t the driving issue, said Seth McKee, a University of South Florida political science professor. "It’s one of the myths in American politics that people think that’s where the gap comes from," he said of abortion. "There are lots of pro-choice men." Instead, the gender gap is traditionally widened by issues of aggression -- meaning, more aversion from women to war and gun rights -- and government programs. Women are more likely to be in charge of family decisions on education, health and budgets, so they place more value on programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, said Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. "It’s typically the woman who is responsible for all of that," she said. "And in general the Democrats are more supportive of providing those services to women and their families." Where do reproductive issues rank? Not high, no matter the poll. Here’s how the issue of abortion ranked in May 2012 when Washington University’s American Panel Survey asked people what issue they thought is "the most important problem facing the country today." Male Female Total Abortion .3% .9% .6% Economy in general 32.7% 35.6% 34.2% Unemployment 13.5% 10.6% 12% Budget deficit 12.8% 8.1% 10.4% Moral decline 10.6% 7.9% 9.2% Abortion didn’t break a percentage point. Still, Bondi’s statement does not account for a couple factors, said Jeffrey Jones, managing editor of Gallup polls. First, he said, everyone cares most about the economy when it’s bleak. And even in a decent economy, sizing up single issues (abortion, gay marriage, campaign finance) next to as broad a topic as the economy is comparing apples and oranges. In a close presidential race like this one, both sides will pounce on social controversies in hopes of moving the needle. The Obama campaign, for instance, is using the abortion debate -- inflamed anew by Todd Akin’s "legitimate rape" controversy -- to appeal to unmarried women, said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Obama has to be sensitive to women's concerns about the economy and deflecting their concerns to issues such as contraception and abortion could be a good strategy," she said. NARAL Pro-Choice America political director Beth Shipp said polls by the group show abortion rights help Obama among women labeled "Obama defectors," meaning they voted for him in 2008 but are not committed this year. "We don’t need to move 5 percent or 10 percent. We don’t need to move 2 percent," Shipp said. "I can move a .5 percent or 1 percent and affect the outcome of this race." On the other side of the debate, anti-abortion advocates plan to use Obama’s "extreme abortion record" with the same end goal, according to an Aug. 29, 2012, Washington Post story. Some experts argue that reproductive rights and the economy aren’t completely separate issues. If women aren’t worried about issues of contraception and abortion, it’s probably because they think those issues are long settled, says David Johnson, a University of South Florida history professor. "Women in the ‘60s and ‘70s were fighting for reproductive freedom so that they could work," Johnson said in an interview. "If they could not control when they could have children, they could not work." Our ruling It’s worth noting that people on both sides of the issue believe debates on abortion rights can help or hurt a candidate on the margins in a tight race. But Bondi is right that women, like men, place the most importance on economic issues this election cycle. We rate her statement True. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.

pomt-10192	Barack Obama got more campaign contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairmen of the committee that oversees them."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/19/john-mccain/their-employees-have-donated/	During a campaign speech in Green Bay, Wis., John McCain called for reforms on Wall Street oversight and blasted his Democratic opponent Barack Obama. Among his prime targets: the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "While Fannie and Freddie were working to keep Congress away from their house of cards, Senator Obama was taking their money," McCain said. "He got more, in fact, than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairmen of the committee that oversees them. And while Fannie Mae was betraying the public trust, somehow its former CEO had managed to gain my opponent's trust to the point that Senator Obama actually put him in charge of his vice presidential search." It's true that Obama selected Jim Johnson, the chaiman and CEO of Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998, to advise him on his vice presidential choice. But Johnson resigned the unpaid position on June 11, 2008, months before veep nominee Joe Biden was chosen, amid criticism of compensation and favorable mortgage terms Johnson received. Here we'll look at McCain's statement that Obama received the second-most campaign contributions from Fannie Mae. The source for this data is the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which has compiled a list of which political leaders received the most money from employees of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Obama's campaign cites this source to back up its claim that John McCain has received more than $2-million from big oil . On the Freddie and Fannie question, it as McCain said: Obama is No. 2 on the list, with $126,349, right after Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who had $165,400. But the list requires a few notes of explanation. Corporations cannot give to candidates, so the center's list adds up contributions from Fannie and Freddie employees and their families. Obama has received a lot of money during his presidential campaign, though, and Fannie and Freddie don't make his list of top 20 companies. (The top three companies with employees donating to Obama are Goldman Sachs, University of California, and Citigroup, according to the center.) The New York Times looked at contributions from Fannie and Freddie's boards of directors and lobbyists, who are technically not employees. That analysis found Fannie and Freddie-related contributors gave $169,000 to John McCain and his related committees, compared with $16,000 to Obama and his related committees. Nevertheless, the center's information does reflect which candidates are getting the most money from Fannie and Freddie employees. There are other ways to parse the campaign finance numbers, but McCain is correct when he says Obama got the second-most money on a list compiled by a respected, nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog.

pomt-04777	"We have only one person on the (TVA) board, to my knowledge, who even has any corporate board experience."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/26/bob-corker/sen-bob-corker-says-tva-board-directors-has-only-o/	Back in 2004, Bill Frist, then Senate majority leader, spearheaded congressional passage of legislation that eliminated the Tennessee Valley Authority's three-member, full-time board of directors and replaced it with a panel of nine part-time directors. Sen. Bob Corker, who succeeded Frist in a Tennessee Senate seat, now says the board isn't working out. Corker first questioned TVA's governance structure and the qualifications of board members in an August news release. He elaborated in subsequent interviews, telling the Chattanooga Times-Free Press: "As you look at TVA today as an $11 billion-a-year company with tremendous challenges, it has a board of directors with the qualifications that I think would cause most Tennesseans to be very concerned. . . . We have only one person on the board, to my knowledge, who even has any corporate board experience." We understand that picking TVA board members involves a political process -- they're nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. But has that really left governance of a governmental agency with $11 billion in revenues and almost $30 billion in debt to folks without appropriate corporate management experience? As a starting point, it should be noted that the board, authorized for nine members, currently has just six and two of those have terms that will expire at the end of this year. President Obama nominated Peter Mahurin of Bowling Green, Ky., as a new board member in February, but there has so far been no Senate committee hearing scheduled on his confirmation. It's thus at least possible the TVA board could lack a quorum of five members for meetings by the end of the year. That, setting aside qualification questions, would raise concern for whether the board could even function. The one board member who Corker counts as having corporate board experience is Bill Sansom, the chairman. He is the longtime chairman and CEO of H.T. Hackney Co., a Knoxville firm in the wholesale grocery and furniture manufacturing business. The other five sitting members: -- Marilyn A. Brown of Atlanta, a professor of energy policy at Georgia Technological Institute and a "distinguished visiting scientist" at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. -- William Graves of Memphis, who retired in 2010 as presiding bishop of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church and who served on the board of Memphis Light, Gas and Water. -- Barbara S. Haskew of Chattanooga, an economic professor at Middle Tennessee State University who previously served as dean of the College of Business Administration and worked for eight years as a TVA manager. -- Richard Howorth, founder and owner of Square Books, an independent bookstore with two affiliates operations who is a past chairman of the American Booksellers Association. He served eight years as mayor of Oxford, Miss., and chaired the Oxford Electric Authority. -- Neil McBride, an Oak Ridge lawyer and adjunct professor at the University of Tennessee School of Law who is also general counsel for the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. Brown and Graves are the board members with terms expiring this year. Of this group, it would appear that Howorth might come closest to Sansom in business management background. In a telephone interview, Howorth declined to address Corker's comments directly, but said he does believe his background has provided ample executive experience to oversee TVA's operations. "If I didn't, I wouldn't have agreed to take the job," Howorth said. He spent 11 years on the board of directors of the American Booksellers Association, including two years as president and chairman, Howorth said. The association, a non-profit corporation, had a $40 million budget and the position "required a great deal of engagement," he said. Serving as a city's chief executive officer and as chairman of the electric board could also be viewed as the equivalent of corporate board experience, he suggested. There's also the pending nomination of Mahurin, who is chairman of Hilliard Lyons Financial Services and who serves on five other corporate boards of directors, according to the White House press release announcing his nomination. Hilliard Lyons has 400 financial consultants operating in 12 states, according to the company website. And some might see Graves' service on the board of MGLW, which serves some 430,000 customers, as providing an appropriate boardroom background though the ministry has been his primary profession. A call to Corker's office for elaboration on his comments brought a return call from the senator himself. "This is no way an attempt take shots at anyone," he said. "It's really about the federal process." For presidents of both political parties, he said, appointment of TVA directors is "a hassle and to some degree an annoyance" that at times seems to involve "just crossing "Ts" and dotting ‘Is’ for political considerations." "TVA is not that important overall to the federal government and certainly not to administrations of either ilk," he said. "It is extremely important to Tennessee. A big part of our economic future depends on TVA." Corker said there is a need to "come up with a remedy" that meets needs all people in the TVA valley and indicated he will be engaged in that process, though declining to be specific about what reforms are in order. The senator did not retreat from his contention that the board today is short on the corporate board experience needed for running an enterprise holding a regional monopoly in power production, though he repeatedly emphasized he was not criticizing anyone individually. "Who knows? We may have four of five of the most stellar people on earth put forward to run TVA," he said. "But that hasn't happened before." Corker expressed doubt about whether running a bookstore or even a national booksellers association counts as corporate board experience. As for the pending nomination Mahurin, Corker said "it sounds like he does have some experience" and that he hopes to learn more about the nominee's qualifications and background. Our ruling Corker’s point holds up, though we did find some other board members with experience they believe is equivalent to the corporate board experience the senator wants. Since that context was missing, we rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Bob Corker	None	None	None	2012-08-26T05:00:00	2012-08-18	['None']
pomt-01371	Almost every state has offered an insurance plan on its health exchange that does not cover abortion.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/17/Rhode_Island_Catholic/catholic-paper-says-ri-health-exchange-one-few-us-/	Abortion was pushed to the forefront of the race for the governor’s office after Democrat Gina Raimondo was endorsed by Planned Parenthood’s political action committee. In a short speech at a Sept. 25 news conference, Raimondo argued that women should be able to make health decisions without interference from their employers or the government. The next day, The Providence Journal reported that, in an interview after the news conference, Raimondo said she would oppose efforts to offer an insurance plan on the Rhode Island health exchange that would exclude coverage for abortion or contraception. (Raimondo’s campaign later issued a statement expressing a different position. More on that later.) Opponents seized on Raimondo’s position, saying that she had staked out an "extreme" position on abortion. Thomas Tobin, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, was one of the first and most vocal critics. The Rhode Island Catholic, the diocese’s newspaper, followed up in an Oct. 2 editorial. "[Gina Raimondo] demonstrates an inexplicable disregard for the sincere conscience of thousands of Rhode Islanders who don’t want to participate in insurance programs that pay for abortion," the editorial said. "Almost every other state has provided that option." We wondered if nearly every state really has provided that option. Rick Snizek, editor of The Rhode Island Catholic, told us that the source of the claim was a recent report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The Sept. 15 report was done at the request of Republican leaders in the House of Representatives. It looked at all the health exchanges in the nation that were created under the Affordable Care Act and what coverage options for abortion were provided in each state. Under the law, exchanges are required to offer insurance covering abortions when "the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest, or the life of the pregnant woman would be endangered unless an abortion is performed." The Affordable Care Act does not require states to offer abortion coverage beyond that. In fact, the GAO report found that 17 states have passed laws that explicitly forbid health plans from offering expanded coverage, while another 6 severely restrict coverage. The GAO contacted the 28 remaining states and found that in 8 states, no expanded coverage is offered; in 15 states, at least one plan offers such coverage; and in 5 states, all plans offer full coverage. Rhode Island is in that final group, along with Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey and Vermont. In those five states, there is no option for consumers who want a health plan that does not cover non-excepted abortions. In other words, The Rhode Island Catholic editorial was accurate. The Affordable Care Act recognizes this issue and requires all states to provide an insurance option by 2017 that does not cover abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother’s life is endangered. Questions about abortion coverage were raised before the Rhode Island health exchange was set up. Governor Chafee created the exchange through an executive order in 2011, after an effort to do so through legislation stalled in the General Assembly over abortion language. As recently as last year, the state Senate passed a bill that would have required some plans to allow people who sign up for them to "opt out" of abortion services. But the bill failed to clear the House and HealthSource RI was set up without any state restrictions or provisions regarding abortion. Now back to Raimondo’s position on insurance coverage for abortions. If the federal government will eventually require all health insurance exchanges, including Rhode Island’s, to offer at least one plan that doesn’t cover most abortions, how could Raimondo oppose it? When we posed that question to the Raimondo campaign, Nicole Kayner offered this statement: "Gina is not opposed to HealthSource RI including an insurance plan that excludes reproductive services. In fact, the Affordable Care Act requires that by 2017, the exchange must do that. Individuals should be able to go to HealthSource RI and buy a plan that makes the most sense for them." Our ruling The Rhode Island Catholic newspaper said that Rhode Island is one of the few states that does not offer an insurance option that excludes most abortion coverage. According to a federal report, only Rhode Island and four other states fall into that category. We rule the statement True.

pomt-00067	Says California Republican Young Kim is "a tax cheat" who "illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in," had "multiple tax liens placed on her" as a result and "owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes."	mostly false	/california/statements/2018/nov/02/gil-cisneros/spoof-website-goes-too-far-when-calling-california/	Imitation isn’t always a form of flattery, and a website created by California Democrat Gil Cisneros’ congressional campaign shows why. The site has a name, YoungKimforCongress.org, that makes it easily mistaken for the website of Cisneros’ opponent, Young Kim. But the Democrat-created website’s content and slogan -- "Just like Donald Trump" -- are anything but flattering to Kim, a Republican. The site has a lot to chew on, but standing out to PolitiFact was a section on Kim’s personal taxes. It says Kim is "a tax cheat" who "illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in," had "multiple tax liens placed on her" as a result and "owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes." "Cheat" and "illegally" are serious words. To understand them fully here, let’s look at the facts, with a little teaser to get started: The property taxes we’re discussing amounted to $387. The home issue If you own a home, you pay property taxes on it. But many states give a tax break to people who live in their homes. This is called a homeowner’s or homestead exemption, and in California it is relatively small. By claiming it, a California homeowner can reduce the assessed value of his or her home by a maximum of $7,000 -- which saves the homeowner about $70 a year in actual taxes. Kim and her husband, Charles, owned a home in the Orange County community of La Habra, and had a homeowner’s exemption through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015. But Kim had moved to a different home in a different community, Fullerton, in late 2012, and in January 2013 changed her voter registration to reflect this. She moved again to a third home, in Fullerton, in 2014. Kim and her husband still owned the home in La Habra -- renting it out as income property -- and still got the homeowner’s exemption. Under California law, homeowners are only supposed to get the exemption if they live in the home. This meant the Kims continued to get a $74 annual benefit she and her husband weren’t entitled to. After Orange County realized this, it filed two liens against the Kims for "unsecured property taxes," one for $197.96 and the other for $189.39, on Oct. 13, 2015. Such liens typically included a penalty and interest, Orange County Assessor Claude Parrish told us. The county lifted the liens on Sept. 30, 2016, after the Kims paid. The total penalty: $387. Mail confusion These basic facts, most of them noted or available through links in the spoof Kim website, were confirmed independently by PolitiFact through Orange County public records, interviews and a financial disclosure form Kim filed after she was elected to the California State Assembly in 2014. But none of these address an important point: Did Kim dupe the county -- was she a "tax cheat" -- so she could save $74 a year? Parrish, the county tax assessor, told us the liens should never have been issued. Parrish said this in 2016 as well, when the matter arose during Kim’s unsuccessful re-election campaign for the State Assembly. Parrish, whose office is nonpartisan but who has served as a Republican in previous offices, issued a statement during that race, saying Kim had notified his predecessor in 2014 "that she was no longer living at the home in question as of December 2012 and thus was not eligible for the homeowner’s exemption." "Unfortunately," his statement continued, "notices from the county in regard to this property were mailed to Ms. Kim at an old address and not forwarded to her, a common problem when people move. Through no fault of her own, a lien was placed on her property for a small amount of taxes due. This happens to innocent taxpayers like Ms. Kim all too often, and is a direct result of the notices not being properly forwarded by the U.S. Postal Service." In a telephone interview, Parrish told us, "This could happen to anybody." Parrish has crusaded on this very issue -- thousands of liens issued for very small amounts, potentially harming the credit of residents -- for several years. He said that 62 percent of his county’s 45,331 liens in 2015 were for $200 or less, many a result of oversight or mistakes. Parrish pushed successfully for a 2017 California bill that authorized counties to stop issuing tax liens if the amount owed is $200 or less. Regardless of the amount, did Kim owe the money? If Kim notified the assessor’s office in 2014 of a move that occurred in late 2012, that suggests at least a year went by before giving the proper notice. The mail issues then complicated matters, as did the fact that, according to Kim’s current campaign, she paid her property taxes through the escrow account on her mortgage. In Kim’s 2016 state Assembly race, her political opponent, Sharon Quirk-Silva, said these were excuses that didn’t exempt Kim from her obligations as a taxpayer. Quirk-Silva’s campaign at the time issued a critical statement from a retired Los Angeles County tax assessor, Kenneth P. Hahn, who said, "The law is clear. Failure to receive notice from the U.S. Postal Service does not absolve an individual from paying their taxes." Kim’s current campaign says this is a bit much. The discussion, after all, is over $74 a year, or $387 after penalties and interest. The income taxes The Cisneros campaign also noted on its faux Kim website that Kim and her husband owe $10,000 to $15,000 to the IRS. This information comes directly from the financial disclosure report Kim filed this year as a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives. Under creditors, she listed $10,000 to $15,000 owed to the IRS, with the description, "Installment of taxes due for 2009 & 2010." Patrick Mocete, Kim’s campaign manager, told us the debt is a result of taxes due from her husband’s employment as a self-employed consultant, and he set up an installment payment plan with the IRS. That’s perfectly legal. Our ruling The Cisneros campaign says Kim is "a tax cheat" who "illegally claimed a $7,000 annual homestead exemption on a house she wasn’t living in," had "multiple tax liens placed on her" as a result and "owes over $10,000 in unpaid federal income taxes." The IRS debt is more substantial than the property tax, but there is no information to show it has anything to do with cheating. "Cheat" implies motivation, and news stories have used the word to describe people who purposely violated homestead exemption laws to save on taxes -- typically saving much more than $74 a year. Nic Jordan, the Cisneros campaign spokesman, told us the campaign used the word colloquially. Whether a mistake or not, Kim had two liens and owed $387 to the county as a result of an improperly recorded homeowner’s exemption. The law is the law, as Kim’s last opponent said. But it was a minor civil matter, and one that the current property assessor says never should have resulted in liens. Cisneros focused on the $7,000 annual reduction in the house’s assessment, not mentioning on the spoof website that it made a difference of $74 a year. This makes it sound far worse than it was. With these elements combined, we rate the claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Gil Cisneros	None	None	None	2018-11-02T10:33:05	2018-09-17	['None']
pomt-05178	Says Barack Obama is "trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/14/national-rifle-association/barack-obama-proposes-major-cuts-federal-armed-pil/	The National Rifle Association is out with a Top 10-style list detailing why President Barack Obama is anti-gun. We’re investigating several of the claims on the list. You can see all our fact-checks by clicking back here throughout the week. Today, we tackle the No. 6 reason why President Barack Obama is bad news for the Second Amendment: "Obama is trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks." (For the record, the NRA list doesn’t rank one reason as being worse than another, so the fact that this claim is No. 6 doesn’t mean it's more serious than, say, No. 10, "Obama admits he's coming for our guns ...") The "Armed Pilots Program" is officially called the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, which was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It’s pretty much what it sounds like. The federal government has budgeted $25 million a year to deputize and train volunteer commercial pilots to carry firearms on commercial flights. The federal government has not said how many pilots take part. In the FY 2013 budget, Obama proposed to cut the program’s funding roughly in half, to $12 million. Here’s how the administration explained the cut in its budget request: "The Administration proposes to reduce funding for the FFDO program (i.e., deputized, armed pilots) in 2013. As the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) focuses its aviation security activities on programs that mitigate the highest amount of risk at the lowest cost, the Budget has prioritized funding in the same manner. The voluntary FFDO program was created as a ‘last defense’ layer of security at a time when comprehensive aviation screening and other physical security measures were not fully developed or deployed on a system-wide basis. Since 2001, however, there have been a number of enhancements to aviation security. TSA now conducts 100 percent screening of all passengers and their carryon items, has overseen installation of reinforced and locking cockpit doors on aircraft that operate in U.S. airspace, and has increased passenger and flight crew awareness to address security risks. Combined, these improvements have greatly lowered the chances of unauthorized cockpit access and represent a comprehensive and redundant risk-mitigation strategy that begins well before passengers board the aircraft." In short, the Obama administration said that arming pilots isn’t as important as it use to be, given other security improvements. Transportation Security Administrator John Pistole also said that the agency has had trouble coordinating schedules of armed pilots, whose flights are set by the airlines, with those of U.S. air marshals managed by the TSA, according to Bloomberg. "In an ideal world, one without budget constraints, we would fully fund the program. We’re not in that environment, so we are taking reductions," he said. The Republican-led House disagreed. On June 6, 2012, the House voted not only to reverse Obama’s proposed cuts but to increase the program’s budget to $35 million. "9/11 woke us up to the reality that we live in a dangerous world. With varied and ever-emerging threats, every effort should be made to make air travel as safe as possible," said Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minn., who sponsored the amendment. (Cravaack is a former Northwest Airlines pilot who says he was in the Armed Pilots Program.) Lastly we checked with Brian Darling, a senior fellow for government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has been following the issue. Darling noted that the Armed Pilots Program had been funded at the same level since its inception, and that Obama’s decision to cut the program in half seems more like a policy choice than something prompted by budget constraints. Still, the savings are relatively small. The $12 million-$13 million in potential savings comprises about 0.15 percent of the entire TSA $7.6 billion proposed budget. Our ruling The NRA claimed that Obama is "trying to slash funding for the Armed Pilots Program designed to prevent terror attacks." The Armed Pilots Program was created post-Sept. 11, 2001, to serve as a last-line of defense in a terror attack. And Obama, in his FY 2013 budget proposal, did propose cutting the budget for the program in half. Obama says the program isn’t as critical as it once was. But that doesn’t contradict the NRA’s claim. We rate it True.	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2012-06-14T17:14:11	2012-06-12	['None']
pomt-04159	"[T]he Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/dec/21/zell-miller/stadium-claim-flagged-faulty-numbers/	The Georgia Dome has provided a real pot of gold for this state, says former Gov. Zell Miller. "In total, the Georgia Dome has returned $10 billion in economic impact to the state of Georgia. Not bad for an investment of a little more than $200 million," he wrote in an op-ed that appeared in the Marietta Daily Journal. Miller, also a former U.S. senator and a legend in state politics, was writing to make the case that the proposal to demolish the Georgia Dome and spend an estimated $1 billion to build a retractable roof stadium in downtown Atlanta is good for Georgia. The plan calls for the Atlanta Falcons to spend $700 million on construction while the state would commit about $300 million from its hotel/motel tax. Some polls show a majority of Georgians don’t see the need to replace the 20-year-old Georgia Dome. They don’t think the state should spend tax dollars on this project. The hotel/motel tax is typically used to promote tourism, trade shows and conventions. A PolitiFact Georgia reader saw the op-ed and asked us to fact-check Miller’s math. Many studies used to estimate the economic impact of sports venues and/or events are typically off-base or lack context. Miller, 80, has kept a low profile since leaving the Senate in early 2005. We tried him through the international law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge, where he is a consultant and adviser. Eric Tanenblatt, senior managing director for the law firm’s Atlanta office and chief of staff to former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, provided us some numbers used to back up the claim. Tanenblatt has been lobbying on behalf of the Atlanta Falcons for the new stadium, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. Since it opened in August 1992, it seems like every type of ball has been tossed inside the stadium. The Georgia Dome has hosted two Super Bowls, several events associated with the 1996 Summer Olympics, college basketball’s Final Four, Southeastern Conference basketball and football championships, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, Wrestlemania and concerts featuring superstars like the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney. It’s even held church services. The Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which owns and operates the Dome, prepares an annual report on revenue, spending and the economic impact of the stadium and its other facilities. The reports were prepared in most years by economists from either Georgia State University or the University of Georgia. In their most recent report, which covers July 2011 to June 2012, the Georgia Dome had an estimated economic impact of $269.2 million. During the past decade, the estimated economic impact ranges between $250 million and $275 million per year, according to reports we reviewed on the GWCC website. In earlier years, the estimate has fluctuated from just below $200 million, as it did for four years, to two years when the estimate was well over $600 million. Atlanta hosted the Super Bowl one of those years (2000). Tanenblatt provided us two spreadsheets that he said came from the GWCC. One had annual economic impact estimates for Atlanta Falcons games. The other had the economic impact for all events held there. Combined, it totaled $10 billion. However, the spreadsheets contained vastly higher estimates for most years than what we saw in the GWCC reports online. For our own edification, we added the estimated economic impacts from each annual report and adjusted the total for inflation, using the federal government’s consumer price index. The total: $7.5 billion. Georgia State University economist Bruce Seaman, who has prepared economic impact studies before, looked at the 2012 report and believes the economic impact is likely between $5 billion and $6 billion. He said the research is difficult and that there are many ways to make errors in these estimates. Seaman said it’s important to have access to internal data when compiling such a study. "If you’re not careful, you’re going to make mistakes," Seaman said. Starting in fiscal year 2011, which covered July 2010 to June 2011, the authority changed its methodology in compiling the report. The changes, according to the 2012 report, reflect the possibility that more out-of-towners who come to the Dome arrive later in Atlanta and leave town earlier. It also reflects that more of them share hotel rooms than believed in previous reports. "Overall, these improved data reduce the direct spending and, thus, the overall economic impact compared to prior studies; however, GWCC believes these results more closely reflect the realities of the Atlanta travel market," Ken Heaghney, the state’s fiscal economist, wrote in the report. Heaghney is recovering from a recent surgery and was unavailable for comment. PolitiFact Georgia shared the spreadsheets Tanenblatt sent us with the GWCC. GWCC communications director Jennifer LeMaster said there was an error in the formula used to create the spreadsheets that they gave Tanenblatt, so the $10 billion estimate in Miller’s column was based on incorrect data. "We regret this error," LeMaster said via email. To sum up, Miller wrote that the economic impact of the Georgia Dome is $10 billion since it opened two decades ago. Miller’s op-ed contained numbers from the GWCC that he and others thought were correct. And Miller has a point that the Georgia Dome has returned billions in economic impact. But not $10 billion as he wrote. The numbers were flawed. And they were broadcast to a sizable audience via an op-ed column. We rate Miller’s claim False.

pomt-10222	"For four days in Denver, the Democrats were afraid to use the words 'Islamic terrorism.'"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/rudy-giuliani/dems-discussed-terrorism-aplenty/	In the public's mind, Republicans have long enjoyed an advantage over Democrats in the area of national security. George W. Bush stressed his homeland security bona fides in 2004 to defeat Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry. This year, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain has based his campaign on the argument that he has the experience and the mettle to defeat terrorist threats to the United States, while Democratic nominee Barack Obama does not. So we can expect to hear a lot more attacks like that delivered by former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., on Sept. 3, 2008. "For four days in Denver, the Democrats were afraid to use the words 'Islamic terrorism,' Giuliani said, referencing the Democratic convention from Aug. 25-28. We won't go so far as to examine the state of the Democrats' emotions — whether they were in fact "afraid" — during their quadrennial conclave, but we have reviewed the 179 speeches delivered there to see how often the Democrats discussed terrorism and it's clear that Giuliani is on shaky ground. Indeed, the word 'Islamic' was never mentioned by the Democrats, perhaps for the reason Giuliani later described in his remarks: fear of offending someone. Muslim-American groups have pleaded with policymakers not to use the term "Islamic" in describing al-Qaida terrorists for fear that it will contribute to discrimination against Muslims in the United States, and because they believe al-Qaida's brand of Islam is a bastardization of their faith. But Democrats did spend plenty of time discussing "terrorism." Some form of the word was mentioned at least 37 times, and by some of the most prominent speakers, including Obama himself, vice presidential nominee Joe Biden, former President Bill Clinton and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. "For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face," Obama said in his Aug. 28 address accepting the Democratic presidential nomination. "When John McCain said we could just 'muddle through' in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the gates of hell but he won't even go to the cave where he lives." To be sure, the Democratic line was more critical of the war in Iraq than McCain has been, disputing Republican arguments that it is a crucial part of the war on terrorism. Obama said he believed U.S. military could be put to better use elsewhere. "I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan," Obama said. In his Aug. 27 speech accepting the vice presidential nomination, Delaware Sen. Joe Biden took much the same line, while also expressing concern about the contribution of religious beliefs to radical anti-Americanism in central Asia. President Bush, with the support of McCain, had ignored "the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real central front against terrorism," Biden said. That was a common theme among the Democrats. Pennsylvania Rep. Patrick Murphy said Obama would "finally end the war in Iraq, [and] go after the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and defeat them where they are strongest, in Afghanistan." Nevada delegate Xiomara Rodriguez said that Obama had exercised sound judgment "to oppose the Iraq war from the start and is determined to end the war and bring our troops home and win the fight against the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11." Other Democrats also discussed the terror threat — and the attacks of Sept. 11 specifically. "Think about it: after September 11th, if there was a call from the president to get us off foreign oil to stop funding the very terrorists who had just attacked us, every American would have said, 'how can I do my part?'" said former Virginia Gov.

pomt-11119	"If you are talking about Canada .. our wine cannot sit on their supermarkets."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/06/kevin-mccarthy/us-wine-barred-canadian-supermarkets/	As tensions rose between two longtime allies over trade, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., took aim at Canadian wine. McCarthy’s interview with CNN’s State of the Union aired as the United States was slapping tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada retaliated with a series of tariffs on U.S. consumer products. "I think what we're finding here is, we are in the middle of a trade discussion," McCarthy said in the June 3 interview. "Nobody wants to be in a trade war. Nobody wins a trade war. But we are standing up for the process of where we're moving forward that we have fair trade. If you are talking about Canada, look what they do when it comes to our dairy products. Look what it — our wine cannot sit on their supermarkets." Does Canada really bar U.S. wine from its supermarkets? Short answer: The whole country doesn’t, but the United States is challenging a rule in one province, British Columbia, at the World Trade Organization. The British Columbia rule McCarthy’s office pointed us to a province-level policy enacted by British Columbia in 2015 that limits sales of wine in grocery stores to products made in British Columbia. The U.S. began challenging this provision under President Barack Obama. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, only British Columbia wine may be sold on grocery store shelves. The only way supermarkets can sell imported wine is in a physically separated area with its own cash registers. British Columbia’s rules "discriminate against U.S. and other imported wine by allowing only B.C. wine to be sold on regular grocery store shelves," the U.S. Trade Representative said in announcing its action. "Such discriminatory measures limit sales opportunities for U.S. wine producers and provide a substantial competitive advantage for BC wine." Other countries that have complained about the rule include Argentina, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand and the European Union, according to the Toronto Globe and Mail. Discriminatory rules also prevail in Ontario and Quebec, according to the Wine Institute, a U.S. trade association. So McCarthy is referring to a real phenomenon, though one limited to a province. U.S. wine still dominant in Canada When we checked in with experts on U.S.-Canada trade, they added some additional context. First, even with the restrictions, the U.S. wine industry leads foreign wine sales in Canada. About 69 percent of Canadian wine sales in 2017 were imports. The United States ranks first among all nations for imported wine sales in Canada, totaling 504 million Canadian dollars in 2016, or roughly $388 million at American exchange rates. The United States accounted for 21 percent of all imported wine sales in Canada that year. And according to the Wine Institute, the United States sells more wine to Canada than to any country other than the European Union. That’s no small feat, said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in U.S.-Canada relations at Boise State University. "The U.S. exports almost as much wine to Canada as to the E.U., with about a tenth of the population in Canada compared to that of the E.U.," Burkhart said. Second, experts said that government-run liquor stores are probably the predominant source for wine sales, especially for foreign wines that are not discriminated against in such outlets. "U.S. wines sell widely in Canada through the government controlled liquor stores," said Munroe Eagles, director of Canadian studies at the State University of New York-Buffalo. The offerings at such stores as "larger and more comprehensive." Dan Trefler, who teaches at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, noted that in his province, Ontario, there are 8,553 supermarkets, but only 70 currently sell wine. That’s less than 1 percent. In fact, Trefler said, "grocery store wines are typically the cheapest wines and are bought by people who would not likely pay extra for high-quality U.S. wines. If Ontario opened up grocery stores to U.S. wines, it would have virtually no impact on U.S. exports to Canada." As it happens, the ability of U.S. wines to compete aggressively in Canada was made possible by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Prior to the agreement, "government wine stores marked up U.S. wine by 50 percentage points more than Canadian wine," Trefler said. "This was a massive trade restriction. The FTA eliminated that restriction." If NAFTA was terminated, he added, "Canada could consider reinstating the 50 percentage point differential. McCarthy has chosen to emphasize a minor irritant when he could instead emphasize the great job NAFTA has done in knocking down Canadian barriers to U.S. wines. Ending NAFTA will likely hurt U.S. wine producers." Our ruling McCarthy said, "If you are talking about Canada .. our wine cannot sit on their supermarkets." He’s referring to an official U.S. government complaint about a provincial rule affecting how wine is sold in British Columbia supermarkets. However, that rule is not in force across Canada, and it’s worth noting that the United States sells a whole lot of wine in Canada despite the rule, including in government-run stores that do not discriminate against imports.

pomt-12775	"When the House wants to stop Enterprise Florida ... they’re hurting our rural communities."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/feb/22/rick-scott/war-florida-house-about-enterprise-florida-gov-ric/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott and House Speaker Richard Corcoran are at war over the future of state agencies that promote tourism and provide corporate incentives to recruit jobs. In an unusual venting session with reporters in Tallahassee on Feb. 7, Scott attacked House Republicans for proposing a bill that would kill Enterprise Florida and Visit Florida. (Since that time, Corcoran has proposed slashing Visit Florida’s budget but not kill it.) "When the House wants to stop Enterprise Florida, they are hurting our poorest communities. They're hurting our rural communities," said Scott, a Republican. We went in search of evidence to determine if Enterprise Florida helped rural communities. (Scott also mentioned poor communities, but that is more difficult to assess without a definition, so we set that aside for now.) It’s possible that some of the companies offered incentive deals would have created jobs anyway. And experts told us that these job gains cited by Scott’s administration are small, even for counties with lower populations. Enterprise Florida’s hot water, explained There is evidence that deals by Enterprise Florida, a quasi-governmental agency largely funded through tax dollars, don’t always amount to jobs. In January, a joint report by the state Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability and the office of the state’s chief economist criticized many of the programs. They either "underperformed," had been "unable to achieve job goals" or had "inadequate reporting requirements," according to the report. Most of the incentives money was awarded to existing Florida businesses that have over 1,000 employees, according to the report. Chief economist Amy Baker told state legislators in January that nearly 70 percent of state-level incentive and investment programs lost money during the past three years. We wanted to know the picture for rural areas. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, which tracks created jobs, sent us data showing 2,048 jobs had been created in rural counties as a result of Enterprise Florida incentive projects since Scott took office. There are some caveats about this data — including a 12- to 18-month lag for companies to report the number of jobs created and for the state to confirm the numbers. Here are a few examples of incentive projects (some with familiar, big-store names): In Taylor County, an agreement with Buckeye Technologies resulted in 38 jobs and state spending of $7.4 million as of 2013. In Columbia County, an agreement with Target resulted in 257 jobs and the state spending nearly $1.8 million as of 2012. In Gilchrist County, an agreement with Ice River Springs Marianna, a bottled water manufacturer, resulted in 35 jobs and the state spending $69,900 as of 2013. In Jackson County, an agreement with Family Dollar Services, Inc. resulted in 440 jobs and the state spending about $2.3 million as of 2012. The department also sent data showing that private-sector employment in most rural counties increased between 2010 and 2016, with Columbia County leading the way. The growth mirrored the state and national economy as the country recovered from the recession. Unanswered question: Did incentive money create jobs? Even though some jobs in rural counties did materialize, Scott can’t prove that they were created only as a result of Enterprise Florida’s involvement. "It is never valid to point to aggregate economic trends as a way of justifying incentive programs, because incentives are too small and touch too few employers to be a credible cause of broad employment trends," said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a labor-funded resource center that tracks subsidies. We tried to get to get an idea of how many new jobs in rural counties could be the result of government assistance, and Moody’s analyst Kwame Donaldson offered to crunch the numbers. (He defined rural counties as those which don’t include one of the 22 metropolitan areas. That means Donaldson counted 23 counties while the state counted 29.) By Donaldson’s count, there were 48,000 more jobs in rural counties since January 2011, a 25 percent jump. The growth was higher than growth in metro areas, he added. The state claimed responsibility for 2,048 jobs — or around 5 percent of 48,000. That’s not significant compared with the natural growth of rural areas, Donaldson said. "Florida’s rural counties have had an exceptional level of job growth, and if 95 percent of this growth occurred without state intervention, than the rural growth rate would have been exceptional even without the Enterprise Florida projects," he said. Kurt Wenner, vice president of research at business-backed Florida TaxWatch, said he believes the state Department of Economic Opportunity and Enterprise Florida help rural areas. A small economic development project can go a long way for impact in a small county, he said. "But if it is ‘enough’ or if taxpayers are getting a positive return on rural efforts is hard to answer," he said. To the workers and their families who have those jobs, they are significant, said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness. "Relevant to the size of Florida’s economy overall the number may seem small," he said, "but compared to the size of some of these rural communities they matter much more." However, a state report by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity and Enterprise Florida shows that very few of incentive programs affected rural or poor areas of the state. Of 107 projects with executed agreements in 2015-16, five programs were in distressed areas that include rural and urban communities. "These projects have committed to create 408 new jobs and are expected to invest more than $110 million into these areas," states the report. Note that is a commitment to create those jobs -- they haven’t necessarily materialized. While Scott claims that Enterprise Florida has helped poor and rural communities, Florida’s job growth rate has lagged behind the national average between 2007 and 2015, which overlaps with Scott’s tenure and his predecessor Gov. Charlie Crist, according to an analysis by the Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times shortly before the presidential election. (The newspapers are partners behind PolitiFact Florida.) During the same time period, the poverty rate increased in the majority of Florida counties at a greater pace than the nation. The Times/Herald did a comprehensive review of Scott’s overall jobs record in 2013 and found despite promises of millions of tax breaks and incentives, few of the promised jobs materialized. Our ruling Scott said, "When the House wants to stop Enterprise Florida ... they’re hurting our rural communities." There have been some jobs created in rural areas through Enterprise Florida projects. Those jobs certainly help those workers. But Scott’s claim over-hypes the consequences of ending Enterprise Florida’s incentives for rural communities. Job gains through Enterprise Florida projects have been relatively small compared with overall job growth in those counties. Nonpartisan reviews of incentive programs don't prove that rural communities rely on Enterprise Florida for economic stability. Finally, Scott can’t prove that the jobs would not have materialized without the state money. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-06769	Says Texas schools have had "massive increases" in class sizes with Rick Perry as governor.	false	/texas/statements/2011/aug/19/arne-duncan/arne-duncan-says-class-sizes-texas-have-grown-mass/	The nation’s education secretary says Texas students have struggled on Gov. Rick Perry's watch. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Al Hunt touching on the new Republican presidential candidate, Arne Duncan said: "Far too few of their high school graduates are actually prepared to go on to college. I feel very, very badly for the children there." Duncan, the former chief executive officer of the Chicago public schools, continued: "You have seen massive increases in class size. You’ve seen cutbacks in funding. It doesn’t serve the children well. It doesn’t serve the state well. It doesn’t serve the state’s economy well. And ultimately it hurts the country." The college-readiness of Texas high school graduates is a rich topic. For instance, The Dallas Morning News, citing a report, noted Aug.ust 17, 2011, that a majority of Texas high school graduates who took the ACT college-entrance exam this year lacked the skills to pass introductory college courses in math, reading and science. Too, the revenue-strapped 2011 Legislature did not provide billions of dollars in state aid to school districts that the schools would have fielded for enrollment growth under existing funding formulas. We wondered if Duncan was accurate about Texas seeing massive increases in class size. Some background: A 1984 overhaul of Texas education laws capped the size of classes in kindergarten through fourth grade at 22 students per teacher, though districts were permitted to request waivers. According to the Texas Education Agency, 168 of the state’s 1,000-plus school districts were granted a waiver in 2010-11, a total that has not changed much year to year, according to agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe, who told us most waiver requests are sought for one or two campuses in a district. This year, Republican legislators made a push to let districts automatically have some classes exceed the limit; it did not pass into law. After asking the U.S. Department of Education how Duncan reached his conclusion, we checked Texas class sizes for each school year from 2005-06 — about halfway through Perry’s decade-plus as governor — through 2009-10, the latest year of available data recorded by the state on its Academic Excellence Indicator System. The annual reports list average class sizes for every elementary grade, including classes combining students from different grades, plus high school classes in English/language arts, foreign languages, mathematics, science and social studies. We saw little change over those years. For example, kindergarten classes averaged 19.3 students in 2005-06, bumped up to 19.5 students in 2006-07, then dipped to 18.9 students in 2007-08 before averaging 19 students in 2008-09 and 19.3 students in 2009-10. Among the grades affected by the 22-1 class-size mandate, fourth-grade classes were the biggest in 2009-10, at 19.9 students. Over the previous four years, fourth-grade classes ranged in size from 19.3 students in 2005-06 to 20.2 students in 2006-07. Fifth- and sixth-grade classes averaged 21 to 22 students over the five years, while mixed-grade classes averaged up to 25.7 students, in 2005-06. In 2009-10, high school class sizes ranged from an average of 17.8 students in English/language arts to 20.4 students in social studies. Over the four previous years, the size of the classes averaged 19.6 students to 22.5 students. So, there was no massive ballooning, the figures suggest, with early elementary classes remaining smaller than required by law. We wondered if classes were bigger than in 2000-01, the year Perry became governor. That year, according to the state, classes in kindergarten through fourth grade were slightly smaller, on average, than in 2009-10, with the biggest difference in first grade, which averaged 18.1 students then, 19.1 in 2009-10. Classes in all but one higher grade, including each of the high school subjects, were larger in 2000-01 than in 2009-10. Mixed-grade classes averaged 23.2 students then, 24.7 students in 2009-10. By email, Ratcliffe said the state education agency is "perplexed" by Duncan’s claim. We failed to connect with Duncan, though a spokesman for the Houston school district called us, he said, at the nudging of a Duncan aide. Jason Spencer said the Houston district, which serves about 200,000 students, has not experienced massive class-size increases to date, "but heading into this fall, it’s safe to say we will have an increase in at least some class sizes." Houston’s teacher workforce is down 400 from last year, Spencer said, even though student enrollment is expected to stay steady. He said the reduction is due to fallout from the state budget. Perry signed that budget into law this summer. "We are looking at having fewer teachers and a growing student population," Spencer said. "That means a higher student-to-teacher ratio." It makes sense that the size of some classes could grow as districts adjust to teacher cutbacks. But Duncan’s statement says classes have already grown massively, a claim contradicted by state figures indicating elementary school classes might be slightly bigger than they used to be — and some high school classes are smaller than they were in earlier years. We rate the secretary’s claim False.	None	Arne Duncan	None	None	None	2011-08-19T17:02:11	2011-08-18	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-08981	"Illegal aliens are costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/16/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-immigration-costs-georgians-more-/	In a recent campaign commercial, candidate for governor Nathan Deal said he's concerned about "you." And for your sake, he worries about illegal immigration. In the ad, the former U.S. congressman walks along a lush meadow hemmed by a wooden fence, promising to get tough on illegal immigrants because they cost you far too much. "Illegal aliens are costing Georgia taxpayers over a billion dollars every year," said Deal, who has long pushed for more restrictions on citizenship and aggressive enforcement of current immigration laws. More than $1 billion? Is that possible? The Deal campaign said the actual cost is even higher: $1.6 billion. They cited a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that shares Deal's ideas on immigration. In its October 2008 report, "The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Georgians," FAIR estimated state and local costs related to the education, health care and incarceration of illegal immigrants. Deal actually understated FAIR's figure. The group put the total cost at more than $1.6 billion. We decided to take a closer look. Illegal immigration is a complex subject, and its fiscal impacts can be especially murky. Researchers have tried to estimate costs for two decades, but it's hard because important data is not available. Few nonpartisan sources issue alternative fiscal estimates that focus on Georgia, in part because it's hard to get enough state-level data to do the subject justice. Another problem is these studies are issued by groups with agendas, said Jeff Passel, senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center, which tries to "improve understanding of the U.S. Hispanic population and to chronicle Latinos' growing impact on the nation." It does not take positions on policy issues. "I can tell you what the result is based on who's doing the study," Passel said. There is some consensus on the subject, according to a 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office. The agency reviewed 29 studies on the issue and determined some areas where they agree. For instance, if you lump legal and illegal immigrants together, they as a group bring in more in taxes than they use up over the long term, according to the CBO review. Also, the federal government doesn't give state and local governments enough to cover the cost of illegal immigration. FAIR's estimate of $1.6 billion was based on assumptions that are well outside such areas of consensus, PolitiFact Georgia found. And that's a problem. Education was the biggest cost in FAIR's estimate, and one factor in their calculation is especially controversial to advocates on the opposite side of the ideological spectrum: FAIR included the cost of educating U.S.-born children whose parents came here illegally. FAIR argues that it's important to count them. Those kids wouldn't be here if their parents hadn't entered the country, and they would likely leave if their parents did. That's correct, but it's reasonable to ask whether it's right to include the price of educating these children as part of the cost of "illegal aliens," as Deal put it. The Constitution's 14th Amendment says any child born in the U.S. is a citizen. If you exclude these kids, FAIR's estimate plummets by hundreds of millions of dollars. Another criticism concerns how the group adds up the price of educating a child of an illegal immigrant for a year. They said it is $8,450, based on figures from the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. This cost is debatable. The price of adding a student or two, legal or otherwise, to an already-existing classroom might be much lower than FAIR's figure, experts said. That's because those students won't necessarily prompt a school district to hire an additional teacher or build a new school. It also might be greater. For instance, a small town dealing with a major influx of children of illegal immigrants might have to build more schools and pay for other things they didn't need before, Passel said. There are other reasonable criticisms of FAIR's approach. FAIR derived a portion of its health care costs from what may be a billion-dollar overestimate. The think tank RAND Corp. estimated that nationally, the government pays about $1.1 billion to give health care to illegal immigrants ages 18 to 64. FAIR assumed the actual cost is closer to $2 billion, nearly double the RAND figure. They reasoned that one of the study's authors publicly acknowledged health care costs could be twice as much. But in a PolitiFact Georgia e-mail exchange, that researcher wrote FAIR got what he said wrong, and the estimate shouldn't be doubled. It's also worthwhile to note how FAIR counted the tax contributions of illegal immigrants. It's standard practice for economists to give individuals credit for paying business taxes, said Matt Gardner, executive director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has progressive or liberal leanings. Every consumer routinely pays business taxes when they make purchases, because businesses boost their sales prices to cover them. FAIR did not include the business taxes paid by illegal immigrants, saying that including them "posits that companies do not exist as economic entities," said Jack Martin, FAIR's special projects director. These are only a few criticisms of FAIR's numbers. But taking even one of them into account can lower or raise the cost by $800 million or more. For instance, FAIR calculated the net fiscal effect of illegal immigration on Georgia as $1.34 billion, taking into account $273 million they said the undocumented pay in taxes. But if you subtract the cost of educating the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, the estimate plummets to about $550 million. And here's another example: Even FAIR thinks its 2008 figures are too low. A report issued last week increased their cost estimate to about $2.4 billion, based on new population figures and changes in how they incorporate criminal justice, health care and infrastructure costs. Whether you think FAIR's estimates are high or low, correct or erroneous, you run up against the same problem. A little more information or context and the estimate swings by a billion dollars, literally. The variation is so wide and the assumptions are so contentious that it's misleading for Deal to flatly state that the cost of illegal immigration to taxpaying Georgians is more than $1 billion. It is correct that Georgia foots the bill for illegal immigration. It could be substantial, depending on how you add it up. And while Deal's cost figure is rooted in data, there's an excellent chance that it's much higher than it should be. It's not possible for PolitiFact Georgia to calculate a specific cost. Too little information exists on the subject for that calculation. Deal has a point, but his conclusion leaves out important details, which could lead to a different conclusion. For this reason, Deal's statement earns a Half True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-07-16T06:00:00	2010-07-06	['None']
pomt-09365	"Cuba wants to let the Chinese drill in some of the very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch, as close as 45 miles off the Florida coast."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/31/cliff-stearns/cliff-stearns-cuba-china-oil-drilling/	Longtime Ocala U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns, a proponent of increased oil and natural gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, says drilling may be coming near Florida's shores whether we like it or not. "Cuba wants to let the Chinese drill in some of the very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch, as close as 45 miles off the Florida coast," Stearns says on his campaign Web site. Stearns' point -- that if Cuba is going to drill anyway, why shouldn't we -- is obvious. But are his facts right? First some background. In 1977, Cuba and the United States negotiated maritime boundaries in the Gulf of Mexico and the waters south of the Florida Keys, called the Florida Straits, according to the U.S. Department of State. The boundaries, called Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), give countries special rights of exploration and marine usage. Mexico, Cuba and the United States all have Exclusive Economic Zones in the Gulf of Mexico, and Cuba and the United States control the Florida Straits. You can see a map of the boundaries here. When it comes to oil, Cuba decides who drills in its EEZ -- and the money and oil that may come from it -- and the United States controls who can drill in its territory. The United States currently bans drilling in much of the eastern Gulf of Mexico (including waters within 234 miles of Tampa Bay, and 300 miles from Naples), and all of its portion of the Florida Straits. But on March 31, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed to open new areas to oil and gas exploration along the eastern seaboard south of New Jersey and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico within 125 miles of Florida's coast. U.S. drilling would still be banned in the Florida Straits under Obama's proposal. Now onto Cuba, the heart of Stearns' claim. Cuba's maritime boundary in the Florida Straits extends to within 45 miles of the Florida Keys, as Stearns suggests. Cuba, unlike the United States, has no drilling moratorium. Its EEZ includes a total of 74,000 square miles, and is broken down by the country into 59 areas. In 2002, Cuba's state-run oil company, Cubapetroleo (often called Cupet), started leasing individual areas to foreign oil companies in both the Florida Straits and the Gulf of Mexico for exploration. So far, Cuba has leased 15 of the 59 areas, said Jorge Pinon, a former oil executive with Shell and Amoco who is an expert on Cuba's energy sector and a former energy fellow with the University of Miami's Center for Hemispheric Policy. The areas leased include the waters just north and to the northwest of Cuba. The waters closest to the United States have not yet been leased. Who holds the rights to the areas? Oil and gas companies based in Spain, Norway, India, Malaysia, Venezuela, Vietnam and Brazil. But not China. China has an onshore, land-based lease in Cuba but not an offshore lease, Pinon said. A February 2008 analysis by the Congressional Research Service backs this up. "While there has been some concern about China's potential involvement in offshore deepwater oil projects," the report read, "to date its involvement in Cuba's oil sector has been focused on onshore oil extraction in Pinar del Rio province through its state-run China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation." However, that could be changing. The China National Petroleum Corporation is negotiating a lease for four areas in the waters northwest of Cuba, Pinon said. The areas under negotiation are among those northwest of Cuba, farther away from the United States. Is there drilling happening, now? "No," Pinon said. Here's why: The decades-old embargo between the United States and Cuba makes oil production much more difficult for Cuba (which now imports about two-thirds of its oil from Venezuela). Under terms of the embargo, Cuba would not be able to send its oil to the United States to be refined into gasoline and other petroleum products. And the companies drilling off Cuba's coast wouldn't be able to rely on American parts and machinery for drilling. "Cuba doesn't have refinery capacity," Pinon said. "That oil should come to the U.S. gulf coast where we have refineries where we can process that crude oil. But the embargo doesn't allow that." Trying to linking China and Cuba when talking U.S. oil policy is nothing new. In 2008, then-Vice President Dick Cheney told the board of directors of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that "oil is being drilled right now 60 miles off the coast of Florida. But we're not doing it, the Chinese are, in cooperation with the Cuban government. Even the communists have figured out that a good answer to high prices is more supply." Cheney, who said the information came from a column by George Will, later walked back his remarks. So did Will, as part of a correction. Stearns' Congressional office, realizing Cheney's misstatement, noted that Stearns said that "Cuba wants to let China" drill, not that China is drilling. The distinction is important. Spokesman Paul Flusche also said the information on Stearns' campaign Web site hasn't been updated since 2008, so the information could be out of date. On this point, it really isn't. Stearns' statement, when it comes to specifics, is a little sloppy. He said: "Cuba wants to let the Chinese drill in some of the very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch, as close as 45 miles off the Florida coast." Cuba is negotiating a lease with China for offshore oil exploration, but it's not in the "very parts of the gulf that American producers are currently forbidden to touch." Cuba controls its own offshore, just like the United States. And the Chinese lease wouldn't be 45 miles from the Florida coast. The areas closest to the United States haven't been leased yet. But he's right in suggesting that Cuba could end up drilling closer to U.S. shores than America currently allows in its offshore waters. We rate his claim Half True.

"Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2 are killed before they are born, which is a greater cause of death for African-Americans than heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS and violence combined," Franks said. The congressman’s matter-of-fact claim intrigued us, so we decided to check it out. Limited data Franks’ spokeswoman, Destiny Edwards, referenced multiple reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, for his claim. Because Franks is talking specifically about abortion, we did not account for babies who may die as a result of domestic violence, for example, before birth. Guttmacher notes that African-American women accounted for an estimated 37 percent of the 1.21 million total abortions performed in 2008. That would in theory translate to 447,700 abortions. That same year, according to the CDC, 670,809 African-American babies were born. But Guttmacher’s abortion data is based on surveys with women and abortion providers. It is not a complete picture. Plus, total abortions dropped to about 1.06 million in 2011, but Guttmacher doesn’t have updated demographic breakdowns, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said. The CDC’s data is similarly imperfect. As we’ve noted in a previous abortion claim from PolitiFact Florida, the CDC does not have a complete record of abortions. Most states require hospitals, facilities and physicians to report all abortions to a central health agency. But not every state reports this abortion data to the feds -- and they’re not required to either. The data also leaves out more than 20 states, including Arizona, California and Florida. According to the CDC’s 2012 data, the most recent available, the abortion ratio for non-Hispanic African-American women was 435 abortions per 1,000 African-American live births. But Nikki Mayes, a CDC spokeswoman, said that interpreting the ratio as a percent wouldn't be fair. Live births exclude stillbirths and miscarriages. According to the Mayo Clinic, 10 to 20 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. The second half of Franks’ claim, comparing other causes of death, is even more complicated. CDC data is split among leading causes of death between African-American men and women. For African-American men, the leading causes of death are heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (23.3 percent) and accidents (5.5 percent). Diabetes accounts for 3.9 percent of deaths and HIV, not AIDS, makes up 2.1 percent. For African-American women, it's heart disease (24.1 percent), cancer (22.6 percent) and stroke (6.4 percent). Diabetes among African-American women account for 4.6 percent of deaths, while accidents make up 2.8 percent of deaths. Our ruling Franks said, "Today in America, between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies, virtually 1-in-2 are killed before they are born." Data suggests a disparity in the number of abortions performed on African-American women than other races. But saying that "between 40 and 50 percent of all African-American babies" are aborted goes beyond the limits of the data. Federal data doesn’t account for all 50 states, and fails to factor in pregnancies that end in a miscarriage. Private data is based on surveys and is years out of date. We rate Franks’ claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/495aa314-3469-48b1-9c22-2a846a816891	None	Trent Franks	None	None	None	2016-04-26T18:00:00	2016-04-14	['United_States']
pomt-01931	U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn has avoided taking a stand on Obamacare.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/27/washington-examiner/nunn-cautious-not-mum-obamacare/	Michelle Nunn has kept a mostly low profile during this year's primary election season, correctly gauging that she had the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate sewn up. Her pre-primary television ads were upbeat, talking about her work with former President George H.W. Bush’s Points of Life Foundation and even life lessons she learned from her grandma. That has left GOP operatives and political pundits to pore over her every statement, and they have. They’ve been particularly eager to pin her down on the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which Republicans know is a polarizing issue. The Washington Examiner on June 9 wrote that Nunn has avoided addressing the Affordable Care Act. It’s a strategy that’s also gleaned attention from The Washington Post, The New Republic, The Associated Press and others. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look at whether Nunn can be accused of dodging and weaving on the ACA. Nunn, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, easily defeated three challengers in the May 20 Democratic primary. She has received national funding from Democrats, who hope to win a seat in what is still a mostly conservative state controlled by Republicans. In November, she will face either U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston or businessman David Perdue, who are in the GOP’s July 22 runoff. Our first step was to determine what Nunn has said publicly. Nunn has said multiple times that she doesn’t support repealing the ACA. She's embraced the widely viewed positives of the law: coverage for pre-existing conditions and expansion of parents’ health care coverage to children to age 26. She also has identified specific problems in the law -- namely that premium rates aren't always affordable and that families are sometimes given less choice concerning their insurance plans. Her stance is clear on this point: Georgia and Gov. Nathan Deal should have accepted Medicaid expansion under the ACA. Where the pundits say she’s been evasive is on the question of whether she would have voted for the ACA in 2010. Some would say she has dodged that question like Floyd Mayweather weaving away from a right hook. "At the time the Affordable Health Care Act was passed, I was working for Points of Light. I wish we had more people who had tried to architect a resolution," Nunn said to an MSNBC reporter in May. "I think it’s impossible to look back retrospectively and say, ‘What would you have done when you were there?’ " She was later zinged by MSNBC News Chief Chuck Todd for those comments. "It just doesn’t come across as credible," Todd said of her statement. "Nothing screamed practiced politician like that answer." A quick look at the "Ideas" section of her campaign website shows no mention of health care. Her campaign links to a few news articles that mention the law, but none of her press releases or news links mention it in their headlines. That’s in stark contrast to the other two candidates, who both list "Repeal Obamacare" prominently on their campaign websites. During a primary debate in Cobb County, Perdue called the ACA "the worst thing in American history legislatively." Kingston says the law "has been a failure." Nationally, the ACA has been a political quagmire for candidates. Do they fall with the vocal critics? Or do they stand with the law of the land? And that’s arguably an even tougher call in Georgia, where 50.8 percent of residents still oppose the law and 45.2 percent support it, according to the 2014 Georgia State of the State poll. We asked Kyle Kondick, the managing editor for the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball blog, for his take. "The state, in many ways, determines the messaging," Kondick said. "It’s no surprise to me that she’s dodging that question." The typical strategy for Democrats in red states, such as Georgia, is to depict themselves as middle-of-the-road candidates while painting other candidates as unlikable, Kondick said. That might work for Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat also running for the Senate and facing a similar challenge on whether to support or denounce the controversial law. She faces a Kentucky electorate that is not as diverse as Georgia’s, and her response has been to remain quiet on the issue. But in Georgia, there are still a lot of Democratic and minority voters, which means Nunn can’t stray too far right. "You can’t run exclusively like a Republican because how are people going to come out and vote for you?" Kondick said. "You’re threading the needle." Nunn deflects the hypothetical questions – after all, she wasn’t in Congress to vote for or against passage of the ACA. Instead, she makes generic accusations of dysfunction among legislators. "Folks in Washington need to stop playing political games and come together and fix what's wrong with the law, and preserve the parts that are working," Nunn said in a statement to Healthcare Georgia, forwarded to PolitiFact by her campaign. But has Nunn done "cartwheels" (gone of out her way) to avoid taking a stand on the controversial law? Nunn doesn’t prominently discuss health care on her website or in her stump speeches, despite its wide-ranging implications for the state. She refuses to say how she would have voted when Congress passed the ACA in 2010, but unlike her opponents, she said she would not vote to repeal the law. While she does list some of the problems with the law, she has yet to propose specific solutions on her website or in person. Nunn has been evasive on some aspects of Obamacare but has been very specific on other areas, such as Medicaid expansion. We rate the overall statement as Half True.

pomt-08193	"Seven more people will die each and every day until the Legislature ratifies these (pain clinic) rules that are being approved by the Board of Medicine and the Department of Health."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/24/mike-fasano/mike-fasano-says-seven-people-day-die-using-prescr/	In 2009, Florida lawmakers agreed to regulate many of the "pill mills" that fuel an epidemic of prescription drug abuse. Those regulations were set to take effect Nov. 28, 2010, for most pain clinics. But they were stalled by a new law intended to crack down on expensive state regulations. The law, approved Nov. 16 when the Legislature met in a one-day session to override eight vetoes by Gov. Charlie Crist, requires legislative approval of rules that have a measurable fiscal impact on commerce. The state Department of Health now must determine whether the new rules exceed the threshold and require a legislative sign-off -- if they have a $1 million adverse impact over five years on economic growth, competitiveness, employment, investment, job creation or regulatory costs. For now, the upshot is that the rules are stalled. What will happen in the meantime? "What's going to happen is nothing," said Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey. "And seven more people will die each and every day until the Legislature ratifies these rules that are being approved by the Board of Medicine and the Department of Health." Fasano was a sponsor of the pain clinic legislation that cracked down on facilities freely dispensing medications being used by drug abusers who were doctor-shopping. Fasano also was critical of the Legislature for passing the new rule-making bill, arguing it needed more study. For this item, we wanted to examine the scope of the problem. Is Fasano correct that seven people die each day from prescription drug abuse? Fasano was referring to a 2009 study by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that tracked which drugs were identified in deceased people. The study shows Fasano is correct: 2,488 people died in Florida with at least one prescription drug listed as the cause of death. That works out to an average of 6.8 people per day. The drug that caused the most deaths (1,185) in 2009 was oxycodone, a strong pain killer. That was followed by benzodiazepines, which are used to treat stress, anxiety and seizures (1,099), methadone (720), alcohol (559), cocaine (529) and morphine (302). Compared to previous years, prescription drug abuse is significantly higher. In 2005 -- the earliest report on the FDLE website -- oxycodone was only responsible for 340 deaths. That's nearly a 250 percent increase in four years. Benzodiazepines, the drugs used for stress, were listed as the cause of death for 574 people. One drug that showed a significant drop was cocaine. In 2005, it resulted in 732 deaths, or about 200 more than last year. Prescription drug deaths have exploded so much that FDLE did not list them as a separate category in 2005, though past reports noted the steady increase of oxycodone-related deaths. It's worth noting that the report lists all deaths related to prescription drugs -- not only people who got their drugs from pill mills. "There's no way of telling if they specifically got their meds from a pain clinic," said Capt. Robert Alfonso, head of the Pinellas County Sheriff's narcotics unit. "The only thing we can really quantify is that people are dying from prescription medication." Besides clinics that freely dispense hundreds of pills each day, Alfonso also listed prescription fraud as a major problem. People who write fake prescriptions for pain pills can entirely bypass a clinic and head straight to pharmacies. "There are just so many different aspects of this that are causing problems," he said. Of course, the rise in prescription-related deaths coincides with an explosion in pain clinics. Take two examples from South Florida. The Palm Beach Post reported that 30 new pain clinics opened in Palm Beach County from 2007 to 2009. And in Broward County, clinics swelled from four in 2007 to 115 in 2009. So it's logical -- but not precise -- to link the soaring number of deaths with the growth of pill mills. Fasano, an advocate for cracking down on unscrupulous pain clinics, underscores his argument for more regulation with an attention-grabbing statistic: an average of seven people die each day from prescription drugs. The numbers from Florida's top law enforcement agency bear him out. However, not all of the prescription-related deaths originated at pill mills. Experts say that figure is hard to quantify. We rate Fasano's statement Mostly True.	None	Mike Fasano	None	None	None	2010-11-24T18:21:54	2010-11-23	['None']
pomt-13147	"Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot smart, intelligent men to stay home, too."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/31/hillary-clinton/clinton-exaggerates-trumps-campaign-strategy/	With a little more than a week until Election Day, Hillary Clinton attacked what she called Donald Trump’s strategy to keep groups of people away from the polls come Nov. 8. "Donald Trump's strategy is real simple," Clinton told a crowd Oct. 29 in Daytona Beach, Fla. "They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too." Has Trump’s campaign really said that? It turns out Clinton is referring to news articles that quote anonymous Trump advisers who say the campaign's strategy is to keep Clinton supporters home on Election Day by ratcheting up her negatives. Suppression? More like voter depression Clinton’s campaign pointed to news reports that quote anonymous Trump officials. The first example is a Bloomberg Businessweek article from Oct. 27 that takes readers behind the scenes of Trump’s marketing operations. The article quotes a senior Trump campaign official saying that the campaign has "three major voter suppression operations under way." The article doesn’t offer any more details about the source other than the fact the person was a "senior official." According to the Bloomberg story, the suppression operations are targeting white liberals, young women and African Americans through radio spots, social media and targeting specific neighborhoods. What specifically is Trump telling those groups? Clinton’s 1996 remark where she suggests some African-American males are "super predators" is being used in social media posts aimed at discouraging African-Americans from voting. The group of women who say they were sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and degraded by Hillary Clinton are meant to dismantle young women’s positive views of Clinton and so on. This isn’t the only article that quotes an unidentified Trump adviser making a similar claim. Trump’s "advisers" told the Wall Street Journal the campaign is trying to "depress Democratic voter turnout." After news broke of Trump’s 2005 lewd comments about sexual assault and women, the Trump campaign implemented a "scorched earth strategy" to keep voters home on Nov. 8, the Wall Street Journal reported. Just like what was reported in the Bloomberg article, Trump advisers told the Wall Street Journal that Trump was looking to use the attacks over Clinton’s email server and allegations about her husband to keep Clinton supporters home on election day. There’s also a Yahoo News article with a similar story from another unidentified source. Caveats There are caveats that come with Clinton’s claim. First, we can’t independently verify if Trump officials said these things. Trump, himself, has said not to trust articles that don’t name specific sources. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Also, publicly, Trump has gone to great lengths to court women and African-American voters. He has called for six weeks of mandatory paid maternity leave and tax credits for child care. And he has tried to attract African-Americans by touting his business plan, saying the Clinton and Democrats have failed. "What the hell do you have to lose?" said Trump, asking for black voters' support. Further, experts say what the media reports are describing are not all that shocking or atypical. In some ways, Clinton is describing modern-day politics warts and all. Tobe Berkovitz, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University, who has worked as a political media consultant for presidential campaigns, said it’s likely that Trump’s campaign is trying to curb Clinton voters with negative campaigning. He said this is not unusual because modern politics based in negativity is an inherent part of campaigns, adding that negative campaigning "discourages the hell out of all voters." If you look at Trump’s strategy as negative campaigning, then it seems that Trump is not trying to suppress voters, but depress them. Our ruling Clinton said, "Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They have even said in his campaign it's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home, too." That’s leaving a lot of details out. Trump never literally told women, young people, people of color and "intelligent men," to stay home on Nov. 8. Clinton’s remark refers to news articles that quote anonymous sources from the campaign saying the strategy is to reduce turnout for Clinton by targeting specific groups of people, including young people, women and people of color. Yet Trump himself has tried to woo women and African-Americans on the campaign trail and said anonymous-sourced stories from his campaign should not be trusted. Lastly, experts say what Clinton is describing is a fairly typical type of negative campaigning. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08066	Four out of 10 homicides are committed by gun in this city.	true	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/23/sam-adams/portland-mayor-sam-adams-says-four-out-10-homicide/	Portland Mayor Sam Adams has thrown out a number of statistics in pitching his five-point plan to reduce gun and youth violence in the city. But this number stuck out: He said at a council session that "four out of 10 homicides in this city are committed by gun." PolitiFact Oregon would think the number higher. We checked with Roy Kaufmann, the mayor’s spokesman, who responded with a 39-slide PowerPoint presentation by the Portland Police Bureau. Slide 4 shows that from 2007 to 2010 there were 101 homicides in the city. Of those, 42 involved firearms. On-the-job officer-related shootings are not included. Here’s the breakdown by year, according to police: 2007: 29 homicides, 13 involved firearms. 2008: 27 homicides, nine involved firearms. 2009: 21 homicides, nine involved firearms. 2010: 24 homicides, 11 involved firearms. Because we were curious to know how others died in those years, we decided to check The Oregonian’s in-house library for our own list of homicides. And we came up with this rendering, again, excluding officer-related shootings: 2007: 29 homicides, with 13 involving firearms, four were stabbed, three died of head injuries. 2008: 27 homicides, nine involved firearms, a dozen were stabbed. 2009: 21 homicides, nine involved firearms, six were stabbed, and the remaining six died of strangulation, drowning, head trauma, bludgeoning, vehicular homicide and a stopped heart. Finally, we checked the Portland Police Bureau’s news releases to track this year’s homicides so far. 2010: 25 homicides to date, 11 involved firearms, seven people were stabbed and two were strangled. The deaths reported in our review adds up to 102 homicides, of which 42 involved firearms, or a ratio of 4.1 out of 10. All figures back up the mayor’s claim. About four of 10 homicides in the city involve guns. Knives and other cutters come in second, with nearly three of 10 homicides. Here’s the takeaway point: Portland is different from the rest of the country. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, firearms accounted for 67 percent of 13,636 homicides in 2009. Knives and other sharp cutting instruments accounted for 13 percent. We also asked Jeff Bock, the Oregon Uniform Crime Reporting manager with the Oregon State Police, to check homicide causes in other cities in the state. Again, firearms led the way, with knives and other sharp tools trailing behind. Of 373 homicides 2006-2009 in Portland, Gresham, Beaverton, Hillsboro, Eugene and Salem, nearly half involved firearms and 25 percent involved knives or other sharp-edged instruments. We find the statement made by Adams to be True. Comment on this item.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2010-12-23T06:00:00	2010-12-01	['None']
pomt-07785	A 2005 gay pride vote "had nothing to do with discrimination."	false	/florida/statements/2011/feb/21/tom-scott/tom-scott-says-2005-vote-against-gay-pride-events-/	With two seemingly divergent votes on gay rights, Tampa mayoral candidate Tom Scott is facing heat from both liberals and conservatives. Gay rights groups lambaste Scott for his 2005 vote as a Hillsborough County commissioner to ban the county from acknowledging or promoting gay pride events. Conservative groups condemn the city councilman for voting in 2009 to add transgender protection to Tampa’s human rights ordinance. Asked about the apparent contradiction during the St. Petersburg Times-Bay News 9 debate on Feb. 8, 2011, Scott said the 2005 vote "had nothing to do with discrimination. I oppose any kind of discrimination in any form." We asked him again on Feb. 11 about the vote. "The issue was spending public dollars to advocate or advertise gay pride," he said. Scott is trying to make a distinction between issues like housing or employment discrimination and support for gay pride events. He highlights his recent vote and says he wants to be a mayor who represents everyone. We wanted to dig deeper into Hillborough's policy. Does it have anything to do with discrimination? It began in 2005 when then-County Commissioner Ronda Storms saw a display at a county library promoting Gay Pride month. Storms, who is now a state senator, worried about passing the display with her kids and having to explain it to them. On June 15, 2005, Storms made the following motion at a county commission meeting: "I move that we adopt a policy that Hillsborough County government abstain from acknowledging, promoting or participating in gay pride recognition and events, little g, little p." Scott seconded the motion. It passed 5-1. Storms followed up with a second proposal that the policy can only be rescinded with a super-majority vote and a public hearing. The lone 'no' vote came from Kathy Castor, now a Democratic congresswoman. During the brief discussion of the proposal, she said, "I think it's inappropriate for government to promote discrimination." We asked Nadine Smith, director of the gay rights group Equality Florida, if she thought the policy has anything to do with discrimination. "The vote in 2005 was simple, mean-spirited bigotry," she said. "It was indefensible." She added: "Were he to ask for my advice, I would tell him you should just apologize for what they did. Say, 'What we did was wrong. We singled out one class of citizens to be treated differently.'" County Attorney Renee Lee interprets the policy as banning county funds from going to gay pride events. Participation as a board is also prohibited, though individual commissioners can do as they like. The policy also means the board cannot acknowledge a gay pride event with a resolution or proclamation. "We have not had any recent instances where the board has had to invoke the use of that policy," Lee said. Lee deferred to Scott when asked if the policy was discriminatory. Hillsborough's refusal to support gay pride events is not legal discrimination. Federal and state laws prohibit unfair treatment in housing, employment and public accommodations based on a person's race, national origin, religion, gender, disability, age or martial status. Neither federal nor Florida anti-discrimination laws include a sexual orientation provision. The gay pride policy was challenged in federal court by strip club owner Joe Redner. The two sides settled in 2007, agreeing to update the policy so it shall not "be construed to prevent citizens from exercising their First Amendment rights in an appropriate forum." So the policy is unquestionably legal. But does it involve discrimination? Let's check out a few definitions: The Florida Commission on Human Relations: "The unfair treatment of a person or group on the basis of prejudice and without regard to individual merit." Webster's New World Dictionary: "A showing of partiality or prejudice in treatment; specifically action or policies directed against the welfare of minority groups." The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says discrimination involves treating someone "unfavorably" because they are a member of a protected class of people. (Once again, federal law doesn't include gay people as a protected class.) Basically, it's differential treatment of a person or group — not based on merit but because the person belongs to that group. Hillsborough County issues scores of resolutions each year lauding groups and community leaders. It also supports several so-called "pride" events each year. A 2006 county newsletter reads in part, "Every year, Hillsborough County helps recognize Hispanic Heritage month…" The county is also listed as the top partner of the upcoming Asia Fest 2011. The county in 2007 issued a proclamation honoring the bicentennial birthday of Confederate commander Robert E. Lee. But the 2005 policy precludes the county from issuing a similar commendation of a gay pride event. "The difference would be you're talking about a race or culture versus a sexual orientation," Scott said. He noted the county doesn't promote heterosexual pride events. Added Tampa family values activist David Caton: "Being Hispanic is not a changeable position. There are, however, people who have left the homosexual lifestyle. There’s a huge difference in recognizing a group of people based upon their lifestyle." Whether homosexuality is a lifestyle choice is, itself, also a topic of continuing debate. In an online fact sheet, the American Psychological Association says, "no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles; most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation." We understand gay rights is a tough political issue. It touches on religious and cultural beliefs that run the gamut from liberal to conservative to somewhere in between. Reasonable people have legitimate disagreements on the topic. Regarding the 2005 vote, many parents were uncomfortable with a gay-themed book display in a public library. Many people think the vote is good public policy. According to federal and state laws, the policy is not discrimination. But Scott is wrong in casting the 2005 issue as being just about "spending public dollars" and "had nothing to do with discrimination." The county won't even recognize gay pride with a resolution or proclamation as it does for other groups. The policy does involve discrimination. A group of people is treated differently. They aren't treated differently because of individual merit. They're treated differently because they belong to that group. We rate Scott's statement False.

pomt-12758	"The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/25/donald-trump/why-donald-trumps-tweet-about-decline-national-deb/	In an early morning tweet Saturday, President Donald Trump echoed a post on a fringe website claiming that the national debt has decreased by $12 billion since Trump took office. "The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo.," Trump posted on Twitter Feb. 25, 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet mirrors an article posted on the Gateway Pundit website a few days earlier. It was repeated by conservative pundit Herman Cain on Fox News shortly before Trump’s tweet. "On January 20th, the day of the Trump Inauguration, the US Debt stood at $19,947 billion," the Gateway Pundit website reads. "On February 21st, a month later, the US Debt load stood at $19,935 billion. Trump cut the US Debt burden by $12 billion and 0.1% in his first month in office!" The numbers check out. And in fact, the total public debt has dropped another $22 billion since the Gateway Pundit article published, according to data from the U.S. Department of Treasury. But, experts say, people shouldn’t read much into the numbers. Nor should Trump be popping champagne. "Considering that Trump hasn’t enacted any fiscal legislation, it’s a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels," Dan Mitchell, a libertarian economist and senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told us. "Debt levels go up and down in the short run based on independent factors such as quarterly tax payments and predetermined expenditure patterns," he said. The White House did not respond to our query for this fact-check. Looking at the debt numbers Trump and the Gateway Pundit are examining the total public debt outstanding, which is nearing $20 trillion. Experts said another figure to focus on is "debts held by the public," which is the amount of money the United States government owes someone else. On Jan. 20, when Trump took office, the debt held by the public sat at $14.4 trillion. That figure fluctuated up and down a bit, but as of Feb. 22, it remained $14.4 trillion. On Feb. 23, the debt held by the public figure dropped to $14.38 trillion. Here’s a chart that shows debt figures on selected days since Trump took office. Date Debt Held by the Public Intragovernmental Holdings Total Public Debt Outstanding 01/20/2017 14,403,704,176,388.94 5,543,600,378,823.55 19,947,304,555,212.49 01/27/2017 14,387,267,502,732.51 5,551,752,332,096.38 19,939,019,834,828.89 02/02/2017 14,366,132,157,960.80 5,536,695,305,608.30 19,902,827,463,569.10 02/07/2017 14,365,365,821,333.09 5,530,397,847,836.97 19,895,763,669,170.06 02/09/2017 14,402,429,500,385.19 5,519,906,129,921.50 19,922,335,630,306.69 02/14/2017 14,404,012,711,812.97 5,528,666,521,903.19 19,932,679,233,716.16 02/15/2017 14,417,333,314,382.25 5,520,031,281,120.76 19,937,364,595,503.01 02/16/2017 14,403,392,566,439.40 5,523,188,600,438.96 19,926,581,166,878.36 02/22/2017 14,404,723,995,058.93 5,531,156,856,922.13 19,935,880,851,981.06 02/23/2017 14,384,082,361,381.86 5,529,818,758,806.29 19,913,901,120,188.15 So, in isolation, the debt held by the public is down since Trump took office. But experts say it’s likely to shoot back up any day. "I wonder what he thinks he did to bring this about," said Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel. "This one-month number is trivial in the long-run trend. The national debt will rise this year, and in future years. It will rise at a sharply accelerated rate if Trump carries out even half of his campaign promises for specific tax cuts (and specific spending increases). Will he be willing to be judged by the debt numbers in the future?" Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the temporary dip in the debt is triggered by the timing of tax payments and government spending, "both matters that he has not affected one iota." Added Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor and author of The Debt Ceiling Disasters: "No one who knows anything about budgeting would take a 30-day change to have any meaning at all. There is no credit to take, because it's like noticing that rainfall numbers from one month to the next are not exactly the same or that attendance at baseball games is not a constant number." Donald Marron, Director of Economic Policy Initiatives at the Urban Institute, speculated that the drop in debt may be because President Barack Obama’s administration left Trump with cash on hand to run the government. So the government's need to borrow hasn't been high recently. On Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, the federal government had a cash operating balance of $382 billion, according to the Treasury Department. By Feb. 22, the cash balance had dropped to $228 billion. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion." Trump would be wise to not read too much into this figure, which sounds more noteworthy than it actually is. The national debt fluctuates up and down depending on the day. While the debt is "down" after one month, experts say that trend will reverse and the debt will continue to rise. This factoid is a gross misrepresentation of the state of the debt and the role the new president had in shaping the figure. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11995	"If you pass the so-called Dream Act, it will be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States, even bigger than the 1986 amnesty."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/26/tom-cotton/sen-tom-cotton-misleads-claim-about-dream-act-amne/	Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., claimed a current immigration bill directed at young immigrants in the country illegally could become the biggest amnesty ever granted in the United States. NBC’s Chuck Todd asked Cotton about President Donald Trump’s discussions with Democrats to help nearly 800,000 so-called "Dreamers," beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which Trump is phasing out. What’s needed is a "targeted and incremental deal" that solves the Dreamers’ problem but also mitigates negative side effects, said Cotton, who introduced his own bill to reduce chain migration and prioritize American workers. Legislation proposed by his colleagues would have a different outcome, he said. "If you pass the so-called Dream Act, it will be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States, even bigger than the 1986 amnesty, which Ronald Reagan said was his biggest mistake in office," Cotton said Sept. 17. Immigration scholars do consider this 1986 law to be the biggest yet allowing immigrants to legalize their status. But is Cotton right that the Dream Act would overtake it as the biggest "amnesty" program ever? Cotton’s claim is not just based on how many people would directly benefit from the bill, but also includes an assumption of how many additional family members could indirectly benefit. In addition, the comparison to the 1986 law is skewed, experts said. 2017 Dream Act Legislation intended to help immigrants who came to the United States as children and live here illegally has been brought up in Congress several times but never enacted. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act (Dream Act) was first introduced in the Senate in 2001, seeking to help young immigrants who met certain criteria attain higher education and lawful permanent residence. The term "Dreamers" is commonly used for potential beneficiaries of the Dream Act or similar measures, including DACA. Cotton’s office told us his comment was in reference to a 2017 Dream Act bill introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill. The nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute estimated the effort could lead to 1.5 million immigrants receiving lawful permanent residence. The Graham-Durbin bill would grant immigrants without criminal records and who meet specific criteria a conditional status for eight years. Immigrants who meet additional requirements (such as certain levels of educational attainment, military service and employment) would become eligible for lawful permanent residence. Potential beneficiaries must have arrived in the United States before they were 18 years old and lived here four years or more. The Migration Policy Institute estimated that about 3.3 million people meet the criteria for age at arrival and length of U.S. residence. It breaks down that figure, calculating that about 1.8 million are immediately eligible for conditional status and 1.5 million eligible for legal permanent residence. Cotton’s office said the problem is that recipients will then be able to sponsor relatives. "The 2017 Dream Act is not limited to DACA recipients … Those who receive green cards will then be able to sponsor their illegal-immigrant parents (who came illegally with the children) for (a green card)," said Caroline Rabbitt, Cotton’s communications director. Lawful permanent residents cannot sponsor a parent for a green card — only U.S. citizens can do that. But lawful permanent residents can eventually apply to become naturalized citizens. If each of the 1.5 million immigrants sponsors one parent, then total amnesty would be over 3 million people, said Rabbitt, adding that this is a probably a low estimate because "statistical studies have found that immigrants eventually sponsor between 1.11 and 3.46 family members on average." 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act What constitutes amnesty is hotly debated, but Cotton said he defined amnesty as "giving legal status to people who came here illegally." Cotton’s estimate is that at least 3 million people could go from living illegally to legally as a result of the Graham-Durbin bill. Based on those calculations, is that greater than the number of people who benefitted from the 1986 law? Not exactly. Republican President Ronald Reagan signed into law the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), also known as the Simpson-Mazzoli Act. The law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards — including people who had been in the United States since 1982 and special agricultural workers. "While those 2.7 million went on to sponsor family members as well, the ones they sponsored would not have been illegal beforehand, as would be the parents of DREAM Act beneficiaries," Rabbitt said. That’s not accurate, several immigration experts told us. "There was no prohibition in the 1986 law against sponsoring family members who were in the United States illegally," said Ann Lin, associate professor of public policy at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Since immigration categories did not distinguish between family applicants of IRCA and other family members of other eligible green-card holders and citizens, there are no estimates of the number of derivative sponsorships by IRCA principals, Lin said. The claim from Cotton’s office is "completely implausible," said Elizabeth F. Cohen, an immigration expert and associate professor of political science at Syracuse University. "Not only did plenty of people eligible for IRCA have relatives living in the United States without documentation, but at that time the unlawful presence bars had not yet been passed (those came in 1996) so they could have been sponsored by IRCA recipients if they left the country," Cohen said. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act placed three- and 10-year bars on legal re-entry for individuals who initially came to the United States illegally. Immigrants who entered the United States illegally cannot adjust their status within the country; they must go through a consular process in their home countries. A policy under Reagan and George H. W. Bush after the 1986 law also led to legal status for family members of IRCA beneficiaries, said Audrey Singer, an immigration expert and senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Back in 2013, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, argued that the 1986 law gave amnesty to 3 million people and that through family reunification policies, an additional 15 million were able to gain legal status. King’s overarching claim was that the 1986 law led to 15 million votes for Barack Obama in 2012. We rated that False. "The 2.7 million people who gained legal status through IRCA did so as ‘principals’ — that is, they were the applicants. The appropriate comparable number for DACA is roughly 1.5 million," Lin said. Counting family applicants of Dreamers, but not the family members of IRCA recipients inflates Dream Act totals and underestimates IRCA totals, she said. Experts also cautioned against assuming that every single person eligible for the Dream Act will end up applying. Pew Research Center estimated that about 78 percent of the DACA-eligible population applied for the program. Some people choose not to apply for programs, and some get weeded out at different stages of the application process, so it’s not realistic to assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between eligibility and the number of green card holders the bill would produce, said Lina Newton, associate professor of political science at Hunter College, CUNY. "In light of past policy experience and current immigration laws it is very unlikely that the Dream Act — at least in its present form — would produce a legalized population of 3 million," Newton said. Our ruling Cotton said, "If you pass the so-called Dream Act, it will be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States, even bigger than the 1986 amnesty." A 1986 law allowed about 2.7 million people to get green cards. Immigration experts regard this law as the biggest yet to provide legalization for people who were in the country illegally. A 2017 Dream Act bill in the Senate is estimated to allow about 1.5 million people to become eligible for green cards. Cotton calculated that if each of the 1.5 million people eligible for a green card through the Dream Act were to sponsor a parent who’s in the country illegally, then the total number of people legalizing their status would be at least 3 million. But 1986 law beneficiaries also were able to sponsor family members who had been in the country illegally, though it’s difficult to determine how many exactly, experts said.

pomt-14503	"So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/feb/23/gavin-newsom/mass-shooting-claims-newsom-pan-rated-mostly-false/	Editor's Note: We’ve received questions about our Mostly False rating on this fact check, with some saying we relied on a definition of mass shooting that’s too limited. As we stated in the fact check, there is no legal definition for this act of violence. We agree there’s room for interpretation about how many deaths or injuries should constitute a mass shooting. And we’ve added the perspective of gun control advocates to this fact check to convey that sentiment. We maintain, however, that the statements we fact checked used the most overly broad definition of this type of crime, a definition that goes beyond what the average person would consider a mass shooting. What is a mass shooting? There’s no legal definition. But a key congressional report defines it as a shooting that kills four or more people. Think Columbine. Virginia Tech. San Bernardino. From 1999 through 2013, there were about 21 mass shootings each year in the United States, according to a congressional analysis of FBI data. Roughly four took place annually in public settings, like at schools, restaurants or workplaces. Another 17, on average, took place in private homes or other locations. More recent FBI data was not available. But recent claims by California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Sen. Richard Pan say hundreds of mass shootings took place — in 2015 alone. "So far in 2015, there have been more mass shootings than days," Newsom said in a Dec. 5, 2015 email promoting a gun control initiative he’s introduced. Newsom references the San Bernardino mass shooting in his email. That attack killed 14 people, injured 22 others and took place on Dec. 2, 2015. Pan added in a press release on Jan. 19, 2016 that "there were more mass shootings in America where four or more people were killed, than there were days in the year in 2015." We wondered: Did mass shootings in America somehow skyrocket from about 20 annually to more than 300 overnight? Or were Newsom and Pan using a definition of this kind of crime that reflects a different view of reality? Newsom is running for California governor in 2018. He has introduced a gun control initiative for the November ballot that would require most Californians to pass background checks to purchase ammunition. Pan, who represents the Sacramento region, recently proposed legislation that would require the state to track gun deaths. Both are Democrats. Newsom’s claim Let’s dive into the lieutenant governor’s statement first. He made the claim that there had been more mass shootings than days in 2015 on Dec. 5, or day 339 that year. Representatives for Newsom and the Courage Campaign said the politician, in making his claim, relied on news reports that cited gun violence tracking websites, including what was until recently known as ‘Mass Shooting Tracker.’ That website, now known as ‘Gun Violence Archive,’ used crowd-sourced information and a much broader definition of mass shooting than the congressional report. It counted mass shootings as any incident, anywhere, in which at least four people were shot, but not necessarily killed. By early December 2015, Mass Shooting Tracker reported there had been 353 mass shootings in America so far that year. Criminologists told us the website’s broad definition lumps in more shooting categories, such as gang-related crimes or robberies, than typically associated with mass shootings. Several said this is purposely done to inflate the statistics. David Kopel is a professor at Denver University’s Sturm College of Law. He has written several books from a gun rights perspective. "The problem with the way Gavin Newsom is using this pseudo data is it’s out of context and is done in a way which is calculated to cause confusion," Kopel said. "When people hear the term mass shootings, I think what they think of are things like the San Bernardino attacks or the Newtown crime. … By that definition, the number is far, far smaller." Gun control advocates say there’s no good reason to require that four people die before calling a crime a mass shooting. Using that threshold, they point out, would mean a February shooting in Kansas in which three people were killed and 14 were injured would not be considered a mass shooting. "It is arbitrary to distinguish between a death and an injury," said Ari Freilich, staff attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. "We shouldn’t have to be waiting outside a hospital room to see if the victim is going cling to life to call it a mass shooting." Freilich said the definition for a mass shooting should be an incident in which a dangerous person is able to shoot four or more other people, regardless of whether anyone is killed. State Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, left, talks with fellow lawmakers at the Capitol. Associated Press file photo. Pan’s claim State Sen. Richard Pan's claim was "there were more mass shootings in America where four or more people were killed, than there were days in the year in 2015." When contacted by PolitiFact California, a spokeswoman for Pan said the press release from the senator’s office mistakenly omitted the full definition used by the shooting tracker website. She then issued a new press release with Pan quoted as saying a mass shooting is defined as four or more people "shot or killed." Pan relied on news reports that cited the shooting tracker website to back up his claim, the senator’s spokeswoman said. Again, the experts told us, that website tracked far more than what would be considered mass shootings. "Once you drill down through the data, you find that there are very different particular reasons for those shootings, or for those injuries," said Ryan Getty, a professor of criminal justice at Sacramento State University. Getty said the data might be derived from a family shot "trying to defend their home against home invaders." But, instead, "people just assume that it’s events like what happened in San Bernardino." As PolitiFact Florida reported, "Politicians or others who want to make a point about guns choose a set of data and a definition that reinforces the point they want to make. People who want more gun control tend to choose more expansive definitions." "Those who want to create a sense of crisis over the violence will tend to use lower cutoffs, while those who want to minimize the problem will use higher cutoffs," Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University, told PolitiFact Florida, which evaluated a similar mass shooting statement. William Krouse of the Congressional Research Service authored the report "Mass Murder with Firearms: Incidents and Victims, 1999-2013." That’s the report that shows about 21 mass shootings took place per year, using the stricter definition of at least four people killed. Krouse said federal data for the past two years is not widely available. But, he added, USA Today’s tracking of this type of crime is the best available. It shows 18 mass shootings took place in 2014 and 25 last year. Our ruling Following the shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people and injured 22, California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Sen. Richard Pan claimed that hundreds of mass shootings took place in 2015. They used an extremely broad definition of mass shooting — one that includes incidents in which people are shot but no one is necessarily killed. A key congressional report defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are killed. Criminologists say this definition is more in line with events like the shootings at Columbine, Virginia Tech or in San Bernardino. As we said at the beginning, there is no legal definition for a mass shooting. The California politicians chose a broad definition by using a crowd-sourced website that better fits their gun control goals. We rate their claims Mostly False.

pomt-09149	While in Congress, Nathan Deal was a leader when it came to protecting our borders.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/11/nathan-deal/nathan-deal-says-hes-leader-immigration/	During his campaign for governor, Nathan Deal has repeatedly cited his work on immigration issues as a U.S. congressman as evidence he has leadership skills. He brought it up in May during a gubernatorial debate in Gwinnett County. Fox Business TV host Neil Cavuto said Deal "led the fight against illegal immigration in the House" during an April 29 interview. And when fellow Republican Karen Handel challenged him to prove he was a leader on the issue during his 17-year tenure, he reiterated the point in a news release. “While Karen Handel was busy preparing her resume to run for Secretary of State or Governor, Nathan Deal was leading in Congress to protect our borders." The release outlined five of his accomplishments as proof. We will analyze these points one at a time. Deal "led the fight" to require citizenship verification for recipients of Medicaid services under the health care overhaul signed into law this year. He led the fight, but he didn't win it. Deal was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce in July 2009 when he offered an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 that would have required citizenship verification for people applying for and renewing their Medicaid benefits. The proposal was narrowly defeated, 29-28. Deal was "lead sponsor" of legislation to prevent automatic citizenship for babies born in the United States to illegal immigrants. Yes he was, again and again. We found four instances in which Deal sponsored bills that would end this path to U.S. citizenship: the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009; the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2007; the Citizenship Reform Act of 2005; and the Citizenship Reform Act of 2003. Even before Deal began sponsoring these birthright bills, he supported similar congressional efforts. He was a regular co-sponsor of such resolutions starting when he took office in 1993. He did so for 10 years before he began to sponsor the bills himself. None of the bills passed. Deal "authored and passed" a law that requires that the citizenship of Medicaid applicants be verified. Deal and the late U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood of Augusta share credit for this successful measure, which attracted widespread media coverage in 2005 and 2006. They introduced this provision as part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, a massive budget bill that trimmed funding for entitlement programs. It required that Medicaid recipients show proof of citizenship when they apply for benefits or renew them. Deal was a "longtime leader" in the U.S. House of Representatives' Immigration Reform Caucus. The Immigration Reform Caucus is a group of more than 90 U.S. congressmen, almost all Republicans, that advocates for placing more restrictions on illegal immigrants and immigration, as well as taking a more aggressive approach to enforcing existing laws. Deal was a member of the caucus and was mentioned in a March 2007 Roll Call article as leading its team on birthright citizenship, a cause he has supported since 1993. We have found articles mentioning his membership in the group dating to 2001. The group was founded in May 1999. Deal worked "hand-in-hand" with Norwood on the Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act, which proposed to allow local law enforcement to assist federal authorities in enforcing immigration laws. This bill "became the origin" of the 287(g) program of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which delegates some immigration law enforcement power to certain state and local law enforcement agencies. Yes. And no. Deal did work closely with Norwood on the Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal Act, according to Greg Louer, who served as Norwood's policy director, and James R. Edwards Jr., a fellow for the conservative Center for Immigration Studies who consulted Norwood on the bill while he was with the conservative think tank the Hudson Institute. They fought for it for years. It was introduced four times, starting in 2003. While the bill never passed, it became influential, Louer said. Portions of its language appeared in as many as 20 similar bills. Deal's campaign argues CLEAR "became the origin" of the 287(g) program, and that it in turn opened the door for the March arrest of Kennesaw State student Jessica Colotl. Colotl entered the country illegally when she was 10 and was taken into custody and cited with immigration violations after she was unable to produce identification during a March traffic stop. Her case has since become a flash point for immigration policy debate. But CLEAR did not originate the 287(g) program. It was named after a section in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 -- seven years before the first CLEAR bill was even introduced. State and local law enforcement agencies began participation in 2002, one year before Norwood submitted the first CLEAR bill to Congress. Yet while CLEAR never made it into law, its popularity among conservative lawmakers did pressure ICE to beef up the 287(g) program, Louer and Edwards said. The program received additional funding. More law enforcement agencies signed up to take on immigration enforcement roles. Plus one of the legislation's major goals -- to improve information sharing on immigration violations between the federal government and local law enforcement -- was adopted administratively by ICE during the later years of the Bush administration. So was Deal a leader on immigration reform while he was in Congress? He certainly was consistent. His approach on illegal immigration stretches back to his first year in Congress. He was also persistent. He was willing to press issues such as birthright citizenship repeatedly. Deal is also recognized by a nationally known immigration watchdog group as taking a lead on the issue. "He certainly was one of the leaders," said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. And while his success changing actual U.S. immigration law is limited and his campaign's portrayal of the CLEAR bill's influence over the 287(g) program is incorrect, Deal did play a notable behind-the-scenes role beefing up immigration enforcement. We rate this claim to be Mostly True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2010-06-11T06:00:00	2010-04-30	['Nathan_Deal', 'United_States_Congress']
pomt-08694	"By the year 2015 (Medicaid will) take up half our budget."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/08/pam-bondi/bondi-says-medicaid-will-eat-half-state-budget-201/	Medicaid is a massive chunk of the state's budget, and Florida's next chief legal officer will play an important role in fighting Medicaid fraud. Pam Bondi, the Republican candidate for attorney general, said in a July 31, 2010, Bay News 9 debate that "by the year 2015 (Medicaid will) take up half our budget." We wanted to check: Is it really going to eat up half the state's budget in just five years? But first, some background on Medicaid we pulled from a March 23, 2010, Truth-O-Meter item on Bill McCollum, Florida's attorney general who has since lost the Republican primary for governor. McCollum claimed that the cost for the Medicaid expansion under the new health care reform would be a $1.6 billion a year increase for Florida, which PolitiFact ruled Half True. Here is what PolitiFact said then: "Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior citizens of any income level.) To get into Medicaid, you have to be not only poor, but also disabled, elderly, pregnant or a child. The new law changes that, opening up Medicaid to all of the poor, setting the limit at people who make less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Currently, that means a single person who makes $14,404 or less, and a family of four that has income of less than $29,327. "Medicaid is actually a voluntary program, so states do not have to participate. But all states do, because the federal government puts up much of the money for the program." Now here's where it gets tricky: Under federal health care reform, the numbers on the Medicaid rolls are expected to rise dramatically. The federal government will pick up the tab for expanding Medicaid for the first few years for the additional poor but the feds aren't picking up the total tab to add those who are currently eligible but not enrolled, said Shelisha Durden and Tiffany Vause, spokeswomen for the state Agency on Health Care Administration. That group of eligible-yet-not-enrolled equals an estimated nearly 200,000 who will be added in the state's 2014-15 fiscal year, according to an Aug. 18 report from AHCA. That addition will cost about $878 million -- of which about $373 million, about 42 percent, will be paid for by the state. Overall by 2014-15, the state predicts adding about 1.2 million people to the rolls. But Bondi hopes to stop the federal health care reform by continuing Attorney General McCollum's lawsuit seeking to block the mandates. "Pam believes the federal health care law is unconstitutional and is committed to continuing Florida's legal challenge," wrote Bondi's campaign spokeswoman Kim Kirtley. If AGs in Florida and elsewhere are successful, that could put a damper on Medicaid growth -- throwing a wrench into Bondi's claim. But for now, there's no question that the Medicaid rolls are growing -- the only question is by how much. So, back to Bondi's claim that Medicaid will be half the state's budget by 2015. The July 31 debate is no longer online, but Bay 9 News Director Mike Gautreau pulled up Bondi's quote for us: "Medicaid makes up 26 percent of our budget. By the year 2015 it’ll take up half our budget. And we have to do everything we can to fight that in South Florida, in north Florida, everywhere it’s prevalent and I have the experience of fighting fraud and taking up for businesses and consumers, for 20 years." We reached out to state agencies with expertise on Florida's budget -- including Medicaid. First, let's discuss what we received from AHCA. The agency provided the details on the current fiscal year 2010-2011, showing Medicaid expenditures are about $20.2 billion in a state budget of about $70.4 billion. That means for this year, Medicaid represents 28.69 percent of the state budget. The state's chief economist, Amy Baker, sent us to a report about Florida's financial outlook between 2011 and 2014 that also cites the 28 percent figure and states: "Medicaid is the second largest single program in the state budget behind public education, representing 28 percent of the total state budget, and is the largest source of federal funding for the state." The report from Baker has a chart on page 78 that shows the anticipated growth in caseload: from the 2.7 million average monthly caseload for 2009-10 to 3.3 million in 2013-14 due to federal health care reform. Alan Levine, an expert on Medicaid and a former head of Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, said that chart doesn't tell the full story because the addition to the Medicaid rolls happens in January 2014 -- half way through the state's fiscal year -- so the full impact won't be seen until the following year. As for cost, the $20.2 billion for fiscal year 2010-11 is now projected to climb to $25.08 billion in 2013-14 -- about $2 billion of that is due to the federal health care reform. Baker said she did not have a figure for Medicaid total cost in 2014-15 and cautioned against trying to project such an amount beyond three years. We also asked the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research -- the folks who create economic forecasts for Florida -- for overall state budget projections through 2015. Since it's Baker's business to project budgets, we asked her advice for the best method to project the proportion of the state budget that Medicaid would eat up by 2013-14. Baker suggested two methods: First she said we could assume a no-growth rate in the total state budget, which is $70.4 billion for this year. So Baker divided $25.08 billion -- the anticipated Medicaid budget for 2013-14 -- by $70.4 billion -- the total state budget. The result: Medicaid would eat up about 35.6 percent of the state's budget under a no-growth scenario in the state budget. But Baker said we know the state budget probably will grow based on the recent past. She said taking into account the past 10 years -- which included both boom and bust years -- the state's average growth rate in the overall budget would be 3.3 percent. So if we project 3.3 percent increases in the $70.4 billion budget for three years, we'd have a state budget for about $77.6 billion in 2013-14. Then if we divided $25.08 billion -- the anticipated Medicaid budget for 2013-14 -- by the $77.6 billion figure, we get 32.3 percent. So under either a no-growth or average-growth scenario in the state budget, Medicaid would equal about one-third of the budget by 2013-14. "When you are trying to look at a budget, it gets pretty speculative when you get out more than three years,'' Baker said. "The three year plan -- the long-range financial outlook is what we think is a reasonable window for making good projections. " Now let's examine what Bondi's campaign sent us. -- Kirtley sent us the "Florida Medicaid Modernization Proposal" from January 2005. It projected the Medicaid cost at 35 percent of the budget in 2009 and 59 percent in 2015. But that was wrong. Even in 2010, Medicaid is still only 28.6 percent of the budget. -- The campaign sent us the link to the Oct. 7, 2009, House/Senate joint Medicaid estimating conference. That one projected Medicaid spending at about $18.2 billion in 2010-11. That was off also; Medicaid is $20.2 in 2010-11. Kirtley then sent us to Select Policy Council on Strategic and Economic Planning documents from January 2010. We found three reports in January, but none showed Medicaid eating up half of the state budget by 2015: -- A document from Jan. 11 stated that the Medicaid budget for 2009-10 was about $17.9 billion and was expected to exceed $19 billion in 2012-13. But it also states that $19 billion figure doesn't take into account Medicaid reform so it's not particularly useful. -- A document from Jan. 14 didn't contain the word "Medicaid" -- it was about energy exploration. -- A document from Jan. 21 included a chart showing Florida Medicaid within the context of all state appropriations -- 26 percent for 2009-10 and rising to 31 percent in 2014-15. Bondi's campaign also sent us to Levine, who pushed for Medicaid reform in Florida. He recently stepped down after serving as Louisiana's Secretary of the Department of Health and Hospitals and senior health policy adviser to Gov. Bobby Jindal where he did an analysis of Medicaid projections in that state under federal reform. Levine has since taken a job with Health Management Associates in Naples, a company that operates hospitals, as senior vice president of health development operations and government relations. He formerly served as the head of Broward Health, one of the public hospital districts in South Florida. Most of the hospitals serve Medicaid patients, Levine said. Levine said he gave money to Holly Benson, one of Bondi's Republican opponents, in the primary but recently met with Bondi for five hours to discuss health care issues (that was weeks after she made her 50 percent claim.) Levine said his only role in Bondi's campaign is to provide policy input at her request. His bottom-line point is that Medicaid costs are growing, so the percentage could rise quickly. Levine says "it could mean the 50 percent number is even low." But while Levine cites several factors that could cause the cost of Medicaid to skyrocket -- everything from the additional enrollees to the potential of soaring rates for doctors and hospitals to a lawsuit by a pediatric society suing Medicaid arguing they don't get paid enough -- that doesn't prove it will equal 50 percent of the budget. He says Florida should study the impact of such factors and the growth in the rolls on cost in future years. So, back to Bondi's claim that by 2015, Medicaid will be half the state's budget. It's clear that in Florida, Medicaid expenditures are on the rise, and the federal health care reform will bring additional costs. Bondi's campaign cites a projection from January 2005 but that report is outdated and written long before the economic crash in Florida or federal health care reform. And while Levine mentions several variables that could cause Medicaid costs to skyrocket, many of those are predictions and what-if scenarios. Meanwhile, the state's chief economist cautions against predictions beyond a three-year window. The only reasonable projection is that Medicaid expenditures will be around one-third of the state's budget in three years if it keeps growing within the 10-year average. The burden of proof is on Bondi's campaign to back up the 50 percent claim, and the campaign has not done that with current data. All the experts agree it will grow, but there is no current, definitive support for the 50 percent figure. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00604	"America has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/02/ann-coulter/no-us-has-not-taken-14-mexicos-population/	Ann Coulter’s new book Adios America argues that immigration is undermining the country, and she was delighted to give a full-throated defense of her stance in an interview with Univision and Fusion TV journalist Jorge Ramos. The two agreed on virtually nothing, including the most basic statistics. Ramos opened the segment of his show America with Jorge Ramos by telling Coulter that her facts on the number of undocumented immigrants were wrong. In her book, she claimed there are 30 million. The consensus figure is about 11 million. Coulter was unfased. "You’re wrong," Coulter told Ramos. "The number we keep hearing is 11 million, 11 million, 11 million. That’s so weird. It’s been 11 million for a decade. But as I explain in the book, they are all using the Census figures. If the Census figures are wrong, then everybody’s numbers are wrong." Coulter said there is "absolutely no question" that the number is at least 30 million. She said the work of two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and a 2006 analysis by two Bear Stearns financial analysts supported her belief. We’ll touch on those items in a bit. But arguably Coulter’s biggest numerical claim was that "America has already taken in one-fourth of Mexico's entire population." She said it during her interview with Ramos and included it as a bullet point on her website. Several readers asked us to dig into that claim. We tried to reach Coulter through her publisher and other channels and did not hear back. However, she gives the source of her figure in her new book. Coulter’s math Coulter zeros in on Mexico to undercut the argument that immigration promotes diversity. "Diversity in immigration ought to mean every country on earth sends the same percentage of immigrants," she writes. In contrast, Mexico provides about a third of all immigrants, and that became her target. In a sub-section titled "Doesn’t Mexico want any Mexicans?" Coulter grounds her statement about America taking in one-quarter of Mexico’s population on a Pew Research Center analysis of census data. The top line number in that study finds that about 33.5 million people of Mexican origin lived in the United States in 2011. Coulter argues that since Mexico has about 120 million people, and one-quarter of that is 30 million, therefore, America has "taken in" one-quarter of the total. Misreading the data In reality, the immigration data from Pew is not nearly as neat and tidy as Coulter concludes. The Pew report attempted to count the number of people who trace their roots back to Mexico, not people who came directly from that country. Why does that make such a difference? Well, about two-thirds of Americans with Mexican ancestry were born in the United States. By definition, they were never part of Mexico’s population. If they weren’t Mexican, they could not be "taken in." The Pew definition is important, and if the numbers about Mexico don’t make it clear, let’s look at another country. We picked Ireland. In 2014, the Census Bureau said there were 34.1 million Americans with Irish roots. That’s nearly seven times Ireland’s current population. One could argue that if the parents hadn’t moved to the United States, the children wouldn’t have been born here. But Coulter offers no analysis and no data on that front. In her framework, a person whose family came from Mexico 70 years ago is just as much a Mexican as someone who arrived yesterday. According to the Census Bureau, about 10.5 million people of Mexican heritage come from families in which both parents were born in the United States. This group is at least second-generation American born. The Pew report found that about 11.6 million people of the 33.5 million total had been born in Mexico, including both authorized and unauthorized immigrants. Estimating the undocumented Tangentially related to this fact-check is Coulter’s suggestion that groups are severely undercounting the number of unauthorized illegal immigrants based on census data. Coulter’s starting point is a 2005 article from two Bear Stearns financial advisors. They set census data aside and looked at things like the rise in money sent back to Mexico and housing permits in three New Jersey communities with growing immigrant populations. The article said the increases were much larger than the official rise in population. The authors did not show how they reached their estimate of 20 million illegal immigrants, but they, and Coulter, emphasized that "the assumption that illegal people will fill out a census form is the most ridiculous concept I have ever heard of." The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration much as Coulter does, disagrees with that last point. In a recent report, the center wrote "It is well established that illegal aliens do respond to government surveys such as the decennial census and the Current Population Survey." "For illegals, we estimate 11 to 12 million with 50 to 60 percent from Mexico," said Steven Camarota, the center’s director of research. Jennifer Van Hook, who directs the Population Research Institute at Pennsylvania State University, said she believes the number of unauthorized Mexican immigrants living in the United States is 6.3 million-8.3 million. No matter how you slice it, Coulter’s claim doesn’t get any closer to true, she said. "There is no way it is as high as 30 million," Van Hook said. The Migration Policy Institute estimates the total unauthorized population at 11 million. Director of research for American programs Randy Capps said figures produced by the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey are just the starting point in determining that figure (the Census Bureau itself doesn't create a count). The final estimate reflects a hike of "20 to 25 percent to address the undercount of unauthorized immigrants in the ACS." Capps emphasized that his group, the Department of Homeland Security, the Pew Research Center and the Center for Immigration Studies generally reach the same results because they all tweak the census data. "All four of these sources incorporate an undercount of unauthorized immigrants ranging from 10 to 25 percent," Capps said. Capp’s counterpart at the Pew Research Center, Jeffrey Passel, rejected Coulter’s claim on both methodological and common sense grounds. "It is simply not possible for there to be in excess of 30 million Mexican immigrants in the United States," Passel said. "There are not enough houses available in the country for the 20 or so million more additional Mexicans. Moreover, the Mexican censuses, and surveys are completely inconsistent with such figures." Our ruling Coulter said that America has taken in one-quarter of the entire population of Mexico. Coulter based this on a study that counted all people of Mexican origin in the United States. But Coulter ignored that 65 percent of those were born in America and about a third came from families in which both parents were born in America. Their immigrant status lay at least two-generations in the past, and America couldn’t "take them in" because they were already here. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. Note: This claim was fact-checked as one of the donor-benefits tied to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union. Thanks to all who contributed.

pomt-06722	Congressional Budget Office "says 8 (percent) unemployment till 2014!"	true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/31/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-congressional-budget-office-says-/	In an Aug. 24, 2011, Twitter post, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said of the Congressional Budget Office: "CBO says 8 (percent) unemployment till 2014!" We’ll assume the Texas Republican doesn’t consider this fabulous news, though the predicted rate would be about a percentage point lower than the July 2011 national jobless rate of 9.1 percent, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A reminder: The unemployment rate is a measure of the number of jobless people who are available for work and are actively seeking jobs, expressed as a percentage of the labor force. Did Cornyn recap accurately? The nonpartisan CBO’s summary of its latest economic projections says that with "modest economic growth expected for the next few years," the office expects the jobless rate to fall to 8.9 percent the fourth quarter of this year and to 8.5 percent the fourth quarter of 2012. And indeed, the report says, the rate will "remain above 8 percent until 2014." The nation’s gross domestic product grew 1 percent the second quarter of this year after growing .4 percent in the year’s first three months, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported in August. According to the CBO forecast, the economy will grow slowly in coming years as the federal deficit shrinks, though the prediction about the deficit assumes, among other things, that Congress will not extend all the tax cuts launched under President George W. Bush and temporarily extended under President Barack Obama. In its full report, the CBO projects the annual unemployment rate to average 8.7 percent in 2012 and 2013, which would be an improvement on the 2010 and 2009 averages of 9.6 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, but would be worse than the 2008 average of 5.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. CBO forecasts the unemployment rate falling to an average of 5.4 percent in 2016 and 5.2 percent in 2017 through 2021, which would be the lowest rate since 2007, when the average was 4.6 percent. The report says the projected 5.2 percent rate in those years would match its expected "natural" unemployment rate for the period. Economists talk about a natural unemployment rate because even in a strong, healthy economy there is always some degree of employee turnover as businesses adopt new technologies and make other staff changes, and as a certain percentage of workers, for various professional and personal reasons, look for new jobs. Things are unsettled now, the CBO report says, with weakness in the demand for goods and services being the "principal restraint on hiring, but structural impediments in the labor market — such as a mismatch between the requirements of existing job openings and the characteristics of job seekers (including their skills and geographic location) — appear to be hindering hiring as well." "Other measures also show a great deal of weakness in the labor market," the report says. "The number of unemployed workers per job opening averaged about 4½ throughout the first half of 2011, down from an average of slightly over 6 in 2009 but still much higher than it was before the recession. In addition, the number of people who are employed part time but want full-time work averaged about 8.5 million in the first half of 2011, slightly below the number in the previous two years but still nearly double the pre-recession figure." The report continues: "Likewise, the share of unemployed people who have been out of work for a long time is unusually high. On average, 44 percent of workers who were unemployed in the first half of 2011 had been jobless for more than six months. Moreover, in mid-2011, 31 percent of unemployed workers had been jobless for at least a year. Those rates of long-term unemployment are unprecedented in the post-World War II era." We’re not judging here who’s responsible for the nation’s unemployment troubles, but how accurately Cornyn echoed the CBO’s projection. His statement rates True.

pomt-00760	"U.S. police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/15/addicting-information/liberal-blog-us-cops-killed-more-people-one-month-/	As the country learned about the shooting death of Walter Scott in North Charleston, S.C., a comparison between police in the United States and the United Kingdom began to spread across the Internet. The liberal website Addicting Info put up a graphic under the headline "U.S. Police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century." Other groups made similar claims -- including RT, the English language cable channel financed by the Russian government. According to Addicting Info: U.S. police killed 111 people in March 2015 U.K. police killed 69 people from 1900-present. A reader asked us to check it out. Tracing the source of the data Addicting Information used this eye-catching graphic to tell its story. You won’t find this image on the Addicting Information website any longer. Elisabeth Parker, the author of the piece, explained to us where she got her information. She started with a post that made a similar but not identical claim on Daily Kos, a liberal website. The post’s count of American deaths in March tracked back to a website called Killed by Police. Killed by Police has a singular task. Each time a television station or newspaper reports that a person has died at the hands of the police, the people behind Killed by Police (we don’t know who they are) add a link to the news story in a spreadsheet. When we saw the list for deaths in March, it had 115 entries. We read each news report and found that just about every death, 98 of them, involved a police shooting. There were 16 cases when a person died from other causes, most frequently when police used a taser. One time an officer accidentally hit and killed a person with his car. In a category by itself, an officer in Hawaii got into an argument with a neighbor and killed him, thus becoming a common murderer completely apart from his role in law enforcement. The warning here is the warning with all fact-checks and analysis of police-related deaths. There is no singular, verified U.S. database of police shootings. So all we have are estimates. In this case, University of Missouri-St.Louis criminologist David Klinger said the Killed by Police numbers -- whether you settle on 98, 111 or some other figure -- "wouldn’t be unexpected." Deaths in the United Kingdom So, yes, the U.S. figure for March is plausible. But this claim really hinges on the stat encompassing more than 100 years in the United Kingdom. The fact is, that relies on a Wikipedia list of killings by law enforcement officers in the United Kingdom. "I pored over the Wikipedia entry and realized that some incidents included multiple shootings and adjusted (the) figure to 69 police shootings," Parker said. The problem with that is that Parker had to make two big assumptions: That the list was accurate, and more critically, that it was complete. With Wikipedia, those are assumptions people should not make. In fact, the Wikipedia entry warns at the top that "This list is incomplete." So what’s the real number? Over such a long time horizon -- and in a country whose borders changed (Ireland was part of the United Kingdom until the 1920s) -- it’s really impossible to say. The British advocacy group Inquest has looked at police incidents in England and Wales going back to 1990. By its count, there were 55 police shooting deaths between 1990 and the present. The group reports another 1,453 deaths that had some connection to contact with police. However, the causes range from someone dying of a drug overdose while at a police station, to car thieves killing themselves in a wreck, to suicide while in custody, to excessive use of force by officers. There simply is no way to tease out the details. Comparing police shootings to the American data is the only reliable approach. The only other country in the United Kingdom for which we found hard numbers was Northern Ireland. Between April 2008 and September 2014, roughly a six-year period, members of the Police Force of Northern Ireland discharged their weapons nine times. However, there is no data on whether any deaths resulted. During the times of "The Troubles" from 1968 to about 2000 when separatists, generally Catholics, and unionists, generally Protestants, battled over whether Northern Ireland should break away or remain part of the United Kingdom, there were over 3,000 deaths. Some of those were at the hands of the police. Aogan Mulcahy, a researcher in the School of Sociology at the University College Dublin, walked us through the numbers. The Royal Ulster Constabulary was the police force in Northern Ireland until 2001. Based on an online database, Mulcahy told us that the RUC "was responsible for 55 deaths over the period 1969-2001." We found no information for Scotland. We should note that only the Northern Ireland police regularly carry firearms. In Scotland, Wales and England, the typical officer relies on less lethal equipment such as nightsticks, pepper spray and tasers. In sum, we know Wikipedia’s count is far low, but we don’t know how low. When we alerted Parker to the information we were finding, she retracted her original article and wrote another. Parker wrote that "U.S. police killed more people in one month than the U.K.’s did in an entire year." While the underlying numbers this time are still incomplete, that’s more accurate. Our ruling Addicting Information said that "U.S. police killed more people in just one month than the U.K.’s did in over a century." This comparison was based on an incomplete Wikipedia list. While hard figures for the number of police-related deaths in the United Kingdom over more than a century are impossible to come by, our research shows the comparison is inaccurate. It’s certainly unproven. That makes it deeply flawed, which means it’s False.	None	Addicting Information	None	None	None	2015-04-15T13:53:14	2015-04-04	['United_States', 'United_Kingdom']
pomt-01072	President Barack Obama’s policies "have resulted in gas prices being reduced from $3.07 per gallon when he was sworn in in 2009 to $2.30 today."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/jan/18/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-low-gas-prices-are-result-obama-polici/	One of the first actions by the U.S. House of Representatives this year was to pass a bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline. House Republicans, who boosted their majority in fall elections, have long said that oil pipeline would fortify the nation’s energy supply and help keep a lid on gas prices. The nearly 1,200-mile pipeline would send up to 830,000 barrels of oil a day from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would be piped to Gulf Coast refineries. But Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, doesn’t buy that argument. He voted against the measure, which President Barack Obama vows to veto if it clears the Senate. In a Jan. 9 news release, Scott noted gas prices are already at their lowest levels in years and added this observation: "Instead of exempting foreign corporations from federal permitting requirements, Congress should be working on policies that diversify our nation’s energy portfolio, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and support the president’s policies that have resulted in gas prices being reduced from $3.07 per gallon when he was sworn in in 2009 to $2.30 today," Scott said. We looked into Scott’s claim that Obama’s policies has resulted in a 77-cent per gallon drop in gas prices since the president’s first inauguration. The numbers We quickly learned that Scott’s figures are wrong. The price of gas increased by about 36-cents a gallon from the start of Obama’s presidency to the time Scott made his statement. On Jan. 19, 2009, the day before Obama was inaugurated, the average national price of regular gas was $1.85 per gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In December 2008 and January 2009, it remained below $2 a gallon -- the low watermark over the past 10 years. The U.S. was in the teeth of the Great Recession then and analysts largely attributed the low prices to a drop in gas demand. So the price of gas when Obama took office was $1.22 a gallon cheaper than the $3.07 average Scott cited. David Dailey, a spokesman for Scott, told us the congressman’s office made an "honest mistake" by starting the comparison on the drop in gas prices figures on Jan. 21, 2008 -- when records show gas averaged $3.02 per gallon. When Scott made his statement on Jan. 9, the price of gas was $2.21 per gallon. And it’s fallen further since. At this writing, the average price is $2.14 a gallon, the lowest level since May 2009. That’s a steep drop from the highwater mark of $3.94 a gallon in April 2012. Obama’s role Scott’s office reissued the news release on Jan. 12, taking out the numbers but continuing to say the president’s policies "have resulted in gas prices being reduced to lows not seen in years." To back Scott’s contention, Dailey pointed to EIA reports showing that during Obama’s administration, domestic production of crude oil has risen from 5.4 million barrels a day in the first quarter of 2009 to 9.1 million barrels daily in the last three months of 2014. Dailey also cited figures showing that net imports of liquid fuels have dropped during Obama’s term. Dailey said the White House’s insistence on tougher standards for greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency have helped lead to a drop in gas consumption. He pointed to a March 2014 report from the nonpartisan General Accounting Office which says those initiatives "have contributed to reductions in the consumption of petroleum fuels, but the extent is unclear." But Scott’s statements go beyond saying the president’s policies have merely contributed to today’s low gas prices. The congressman said the policies "have resulted in gas prices being reduced to lows not seen in years." That gives all credit to Obama. We spoke to two oil analysts and they both took issue with Scott’s claim. "I would challenge any politician who is saying the recent six-month downturn in gas prices has anything to do with a politician (Obama) who has been in office for several years, who has witnessed a sustained period of high prices," said Patrick DeHaan, a senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, which tracks U.S. gas prices. Government actions typically have little impact on the fluctuation of gas prices, he said. DeHaan credits the increased domestic oil production to decisions by oil companies to invest profits banked just before Obama took office in tapping shale oil deposits in North Dakota and elsewhere. The main factor in the recent price drop, DeHaan said, is a decision by OPEC countries not to cut production to drive up oil demand. OPEC believes the declining prices, left unabated, will make the production of shale oil unprofitable. Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, told us neither Obama nor any elected official is responsible for the oil shale boom, which he attributes to other factors such as technological advances in tapping oil deposits. "The oil shale boom took place while President Obama was in office, but the production increases had little to do with government policy (other than low interest rates from Fed governors)," Kloza wrote in an email. Kloza, however, does give Obama credit for supporting tough fuel economy standards that he said has contributed to lower prices. "Almost all of what has happened (up and down) for oil within the 2009-to-present period has occurred through capitalism," wrote Kloza. "The president can neither be blamed nor praised for most of the fluctuations." We also point out that beyond rising U.S. production and OPEC’s decision against cutting production, other factors have been cited for lowered gas prices, including economic stagnation in Europe. Our ruling Scott says Obama’s policies have resulted in a 77-cent per gallon drop in the price of gas since the president took office. Scott’s office acknowledges its numbers were wrong. At this writing, gas has actually increased by 36-cents a gallon since Obama entered the White House. That’s because at the time of his inauguration, volatile gas prices had dipped to the lowest levels in the last 10 years. Experts say presidents have little control over the cost of filling your car. Gas prices rise and fall in response to worldwide economic conditions, production decisions made by oil-producing nations, and the investment decisions of oil companies. Obama didn’t cause the roller coaster rise is gas prices that began shortly after his first inauguration, nor did he cause the sharp fall that now thrills drivers. So we rate Scott’s statement False.

pomt-11788	"Pope Francis at Mass: ‘Jesus is Metaphorical, Not Literal."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/22/yournewswirecom/no-proof-pope-francis-said-jesus-metaphorical/	Did you hear what Pope Francis said now? Multiple Vatican cardinals have declared Pope Francis a false prophet after he made yet another controversial statement, according to an article making the rounds on Facebook. "Pope Francis at Mass: ‘Jesus is Metaphorical, Not Literal," says the Nov. 18 headline in Yournewswire.com, a fake news website that says it delivers "news truth unfiltered" and highlights conspiracy theories. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. YourNewsWire.com has made up other stories about famous people, including that Vladimir Putin had said Pope Francis was "not a man of God." The article said that the statement made by Pope Francis "is the latest in a long line of unconventional statements." The article includes various other alleged controversial statements by the Pope and stated he has been "spreading Satanic doctrine." We searched for information about the alleged statement by Pope Francis and found no proof and only other websites repeating the same story. We emailed the contact persons listed on the yournewswire.com website and called the listed phone number, but received no reply. We also attempted to track down a spokesperson for the Holy See and did not hear back. While the Yournewswire.com headline is fictional, in real life Pope Francis has made several controversial statements documented by major news outlets. "He has radically transformed the tone of his office, making a number eye-raising gestures and pronouncements that have liberals cheering and conservatives shaking their heads," the Washington Post stated in 2015. His statements that have drawn debate include the topics of atheism, sexuality, abortion, climate change and divorce. "If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?" he said in 2013.

pomt-02957	"The IRS has been specifically forbidden ... from ever actually pursuing either civil or criminal remedies" for people who don’t purchase health insurance.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/25/lawrence-odonnell/lawrence-odonnell-says-irs-cannot-pursue-either-ci/	With the federal government’s online insurance marketplace floundering in its first month, some political pundits are calling for a delay of the hot-button provision requiring most people to pay a tax penalty if they don’t have health insurance. MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell is not one of them. Ever since the law passed, he has told his viewers to not fear the individual mandate. He said it again on The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell on Oct. 21, 2013 while scolding a White House correspondent. "No one ever really has to pay the fine in the individual mandate," O’Donnell said, "because the IRS has been specifically forbidden, in writing, in law, in the Affordable Care Act, from ever actually pursuing either civil or criminal remedies to collect those fines from anyone. The individual mandate is the only provision in the tax code that was written deliberately to be essentially unenforceable." Don’t believe him? On air, O’Donnell pointed to page 131 of the law, which more or less states exactly what he said about IRS enforcement, or lack thereof, of the mandate. (He actually read the key sections aloud.) In 2014, uninsured taxpayers will pay a pro-rated fine of either 1 percent of annual income or $95, whichever is greater. It goes up each year, and there are more costs for uninsured dependents. There are some exemptions for religious beliefs, prisoners, Indian tribes, certain low incomes and undocumented immigrants. The final bill President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010 included two requirements that essentially yanked out the agency’s teeth in enforcing the mandate penalty. The IRS cannot pursue criminal charges against someone who does not pay the penalty and is supposed to. The agency also cannot file a notice of lien or seize property. "The argument was we don't want the IRS harassing taxpayers to collect the penalty," said Roberton Williams, the Sol Price fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The health care law did not take away the agency’s ability to file a lawsuit against a delinquent taxpayer, though the amount of the penalty is so small that it would not be worth the trouble, said Bryan Camp, Texas Tech University School of Law professor who worked as an IRS lawyer from 1993-2001. The unpaid penalty could conceivably be part of broader legal action against a taxpayer owing a lot more in income taxes, he said, though filing lawsuits is hard enough for the agency because it has to go through the Department of Justice, which has other priorities, he said. The agency does have one way to collect the individual mandate penalty. It's through your tax refund. The IRS will send a notice to taxpayers who are required to pay the penalty but don’t. If the penalty is not paid, the IRS can take it out of a tax refund. Most people received a tax refund between $2,000 and $3,000 this year because their employer withheld too much from their paychecks, Williams said. That can only happen if a taxpayer is getting a refund. If they’re not getting a refund, there’s not much the IRS can do to make people pay the penalty beyond sending a letter. Taxpayers who don’t want to pay the penalty could tinker with the amount withheld from their paychecks so they don’t overpay the IRS, denying the agency the ability to hold back or minimize a refund. But experts said most taxpayers won’t go to the trouble. "It’s a mandate that operates through inconvenience," said Jordan Barry, a University of San Diego School of Law professor who co-wrote an essay with Camp examining whether the mandate is really mandatory. "It’s basically right that you could avoid this if you wanted to." The penalty will still be in IRS records, but not paying it won’t hurt your credit report because there will be no notice of lien on file, said Jaime Vasquez, a tax attorney at the Houston law firm Chamberlain Hrdlicka. "There’s interest that will grow on it, and if you’re getting any future refunds, those refunds will go toward offsetting that penalty plus any interest that has accrued in the meantime," he said. It will take time and possibly legal action to resolve some of the more complicated issues surrounding how the IRS can enforce the penalty, including an Obamacare tax "rollover," said Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. We asked the IRS to fill us in on any regulations the agency adopted to enforce the mandate, but the agency did not get back to us by deadline. Our ruling Experts said O’Donnell’s point is pretty accurate: The IRS cannot use its most effective collection weapons -- the threat of jail time or seizing of property -- for the individual mandate penalty. But the law did not take away its power to pursue lawsuits against delinquent taxpayers, though experts say it isn’t likely given the small size of the penalty and current difficulty of filing suit outside of tax court. Plus, for taxpayers who overpay their income taxes and don’t pay the fine, the IRS could extract the penalty from a taxpayer’s refund. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-11890	"The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen."	false	/texas/statements/2017/oct/25/travis-forward/travis-forward-pac-inaccurately-says-proposed-coun/	Proponents of Travis County transportation and parks bond proposals on the November 2017 ballot made an enticing pitch to older homeowners in a mailer, telling them that their taxes are frozen and they won’t pay more if the bonds pass. Travis Forward, a pro-bonds PAC, said in an October 2017 mailer: "The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen." Readers asked us to check if the propositions won’t raise their taxes and also whether property taxes are frozen for homeowners 65 or older. We put the mailer’s claim to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. The "freeze" claim is inaccurate, Travis County officials quickly said to our inquiries, and it’s inaccurate to say the propositions won’t cost taxpayers anything extra. Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, who voted with colleagues to place the two bond propositions on the ballot before helping to kick off the privately funded Travis Forward campaign, speculated that consultants behind the mailer assumed the county, like the Austin school district, provides tax freezes to homesteading homeowners 65 or older. "No doubt, this is inaccurate," Eckhardt said by phone. "To the extent I am responsible, I fall on my sword." By phone to our inquiry, Marya Crigler, chief appraiser of the Travis Central Appraisal District, noted that by state law, every Texas school district must set a ceiling on how much homeowners 65 or older pay. Counties and other governmental jurisdictions have the local option of setting such ceilings, Crigler advised. See TCAD’s breakdown of exemptions and tax ceilings offered by Travis County jurisdictions here. Eckhardt helped us reach Mykle Tomlinson, Travis Forward’s campaign manager, who said by phone the errors occurred in mailers targeting older residents because consultants whom he did not identify misunderstood the difference between a homestead tax exemption and a tax freeze. After our inquiry, Tomlinson said the group would follow up by sending postcards within a day or so to the 12,295 households that received the mailer, which went out about the day the early-voting period began Oct. 23, 2017. At our request, Tomlinson emailed us a copy of the follow-up postcard which says on its front: "We were wrong and we’re sorry!" The back of the postcard is headlined: "Setting the record straight." Next comes text saying: "The mailer we sent to your home last week wrongly claimed that, like school district taxes, senior homeowners’ county taxes are frozen under state law." The back also says: "State law does not require a county tax freeze for seniors. The mailer we sent to your home last week was inaccurate, and we’re sorry. Please help us set the record straight by sharing this with your friends and neighbors." Bruce Elfant, Travis County’s tax assessor-collector, told us by phone that if the county propositions win approval, older homeowners will pay more in county taxes. According to the county, the owner of a home at the 2017 average taxable property value of $305,000 can expect to pay no more than $24 a year for 20 years should voters approve Proposition A, to spend $93.4 million on road, sidewalk, bike and other transportation-related projects, and Proposition B, devoting nearly $91.5 million to parks and land conservation projects. A county web page enables anyone to input any taxable property value--for homeowners, meaning the value, less exemptions including the county’s 20 percent homestead exemption--and see what the county estimates as the proposed bonds’ future annual costs to the property owner. Although the county has no tax freeze for older residents, it does give them an additional homestead exemption up to $80,000 on the assessed value of their home. That is, county taxes accrue on the property’s taxable assessed value above $80,000 for those 65 and older. Our ruling Travis Forward said in a mailer: "The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen." Neither claim holds up, we found, in that the propositions pose future tax costs for property owners with specific projected amounts driven by the assessed value of properties and the county doesn’t freeze taxes for homeowners 65 or older. Rather, such a resident qualifies to exempt $80,000 of the taxable assessed value of their home from county taxes. We rate this two-part to-be-retracted claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-07543	"In three years we could find close to 50 million gallons per day through a toilet replacement program."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/04/sally-bethea/water-advocate-says-toilets-could-save-nearly-50-m/	Despite decades of legal squabbles over the Southeast’s precious water resources, the problem still looms large over Georgia. But take heart. And look down. Some of the solutions can be found in your toilet, the head of a water conservation group said recently. "In three years we could find close to 50 million gallons per day through a toilet replacement program," Sally Bethea, founding director of Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, said in a recent article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Can better commodes really flush away that much of the area’s water problem? Georgia has been battling for years with Florida and Alabama over how to divvy up the region’s water supply. In 2009, a federal judge ruled that if the states fail to reach a water-sharing agreement by mid-July 2012, metro Atlanta can take only the same amount of water it received in the mid-1970s -- when the population was less than a third of what it is today. Georgia appealed the ruling in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, and the state has a good shot at victory. Even if Georgia wins this battle, the available water supply might not meet the region’s long-term needs. So Bethea has targeted the potty, the modern household’s thirstiest water hog. Nationally and locally, governments have created programs to replace old-fashioned commodes that can use more than 3.5 gallons per flush with low-flow toilets that use as little as 1.28 gallons. This is how Riverkeeper came up with its number: Atlanta is part of the 15-county Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, which includes counties as far north as Hall and as far south as Coweta. She said the planning district estimates that 850,000 homes have old-fashioned plumbing. The district already has programs in which residents receive rebates if they install low-flow toilets. But Bethea said she envisions a more dramatic change. In the mid-1990s, New York City ran a successful program that changed out the city’s old toilets with low-flow ones. Over three years, that effort switched about 1.3 million toilets and saved an estimated 70 million to 80 million gallons per day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under the privately managed program, which was heavily promoted to apartment building owners and plumbers, property owners received up to $240 per toilet to have them replaced by a licensed professional. Experts we interviewed think that New York City-style programs can be more effective than a typical rebate program. They are especially helpful for properties with low- or fixed-income residents who often live in older housing with outdated plumbing. Using EPA figures, Riverkeeper calculated that 8,120 gallons can be saved per person per year if a resident installs one new high-efficiency toilet, faucet and shower head in his home. If there are 2.5 people in the household, the savings totals 47.3 million gallons per day across the region, the group calculated. Bethea described her estimate as "very conservative" because many homes have more than one toilet or 2.5 residents. It doesn’t include savings when the upgraded plumbing fixes leaks, either. We found that Riverkeeper numbers are optimistic. The group’s figure for households with old-fashioned plumbing is out of date, according to data from the Water Planning District. Last year, it was about 615,000, or 27 percent less. And Bethea’s estimate for the amount of water saved per toilet is high. Her group assumed those toilets would date from the 1980s or earlier. The older the toilet, the more water it uses. But Atlanta’s housing stock is relatively new. Under an existing rebate program that will last until 2025, the Water Planning District expects the region to save 14 million gallons per day if 57 percent of homeowners use the program. District figures do not include savings from installing more efficient faucets and shower heads. But since those fixtures combined use thousands of gallons per year less than toilets, we think it’s reasonable to expect that they would not increase the amount of water saved to nearly 50 million gallons per day. In addition, the Atlanta region has characteristics that could weaken the impact of a New York City-style program. The Big Apple has far more apartments, which meant persuading a single apartment building owner to change made a dramatic difference. Plus property owners had a big incentive to switch toilets quickly because of changes in how the city billed for water. To Bethea’s credit, she used careful language. She said the region "could" save 50 million gallons per day, not that it "would." And while saving nearly 50 million gallons of water per day appears unlikely in light of water district numbers, it isn’t impossible. The region could have a higher-than-expected participation rate or proportion of very old toilets. The amount of water saved because the new plumbing fixes leaks could boost the total, and changing toilets over three years rather than 14 (under the rebate) does save more water, total. Therefore Bethea’s fundamental point rings true. A New York-style program "could" save 50 million gallons per day. The amount could easily be much lower, but even more conservative estimates place the savings in the range of tens of millions of gallons per day. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-11232	"Kirsten Gillibrand has put forward 331 bills since she's been in Congress. Do you know how many of them have been passed into law? Zero!"	half-true	/new-york/statements/2018/may/04/chele-farley/gillibrands-opponent-claims-she-hasnt-passed-any-b/	A New York Republican running for U.S. Senate says Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has served 11 years in Congress without passing a single bill into law. Chele Farley, a partner at a private equity firm in New York City, said Gillibrand’s political career has borne no legislative fruit. "Kirsten Gillibrand has put forward 331 bills since she's been in Congress. Do you know how many of them have been passed into law? Zero!" Farley said in an interview. Farley is staging a long shot bid to unseat Gillibrand in a state that hasn’t been represented by a Republican in the Senate for two decades. She believes Gillibrand hasn’t delivered on promises she made to improve the lives of New York state residents. Is it true that none of her bills has become law? Gillibrand’s bills Farley’s campaign supported the claim using information from the congressional bill tracking website. A search for Gillibrand’s legislation turned up 295 bills and 36 resolutions during her time in the House and Senate, according to a query on the website. Seven of those bills passed the chamber she was in at the time but none became law. Gillibrand was appointed to replace Hillary Clinton in the Senate in 2009, when Clinton became secretary of state. Gillibrand served in the House from 2007 until succeding Clinton in the Senate. She also co-sponsored 1,998 bills. That means she signed on to a bill introduced by another member of the chamber. Seventy-seven of those bills have become law. Some of them were from Gillibrand’s colleagues in New York state. She co-sponsored a bill with lower Hudson Valley Rep. Nita Lowey to promote breast cancer research, for example. Gillibrand has also offered 153 amendments to bills sponsored by other members. Twenty-one of those amendments were approved, with 11 were attached to bills that ultimately became law. The remaining 36 items Farley referred to are resolutions Gillibrand introduced. Resolutions are one-house actions that usually celebrate an occasion or change the chamber’s internal rules. They do not have to be agreed to in the other chamber. Gillibrand has introduced 36 resolutions in Congress and 23 of them passed. Gillibrand’s record In other ways, Gllibrand has driven new laws. She wrote part of the STOCK Act, a law designed to prevent insider trading by members of Congress. Her legislation was combined with another member’s bill and sponsored by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Sen. Joe Lieberman before it became law. Democrats have been the minority in the Senate since 2015. Minority members have a much harder time getting legislation passed because majority members decide which bills make it to the floor for a vote. Gillibrand has had more success adding amendments to other members’ bills and co-sponsoring legislation. Consider the Zadroga Act, legislation Gillibrand sponsored in 2015 to guarantee health care to 9/11 first responders and survivors. Instead of passing as its own bill, Republican lawmakers included Gillibrand’s legislation in an omnibus spending bill that became law that year. There have also been times when Gillibrand wrote legislation with a Republican, but was not the main sponsor. Even the White House gave her credit for a bill she worked on with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley last year. "Later this afternoon, the President is going to be signing two bills that were both passed with bipartisan support that help protect those who protect us," then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said at a press briefing in 2017. "First, the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Improvement Act of 2017, which was co-sponsored by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York." Past PolitiFact ratings PolitiFact has rated similar statements anywhere from Mostly True to Mostly False depending on how the claim was phrased. The Republican Party of Florida recently claimed that out of 860 bills Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, had introduced in Congress, only 10 passed. That claim was rated Mostly False because more than 10 of Nelson’s bills and resolutions were passed in at least one chamber. Farley’s statement goes beyond that claim by saying none of Gillibrand’s bills have become law. Experts have also agreed in past rulings that measuring a lawmaker’s success by the number of sponsored bills that become law can be misleading. There are other actions a lawmaker can take to be effective. One example: Gillibrand convinced members of the Senate to hold hearings on allowing gay and lesbian people in the military during her first year in the chamber. The policy was changed two years later. Our ruling Farley said Gillibrand has not sponsored a bill that has become law during her time in Congress. Farley’s right that Gillibrand has not been the sole sponsor on a bill that became law. But some of her legislative proposals have been included in larger bills sponsored by other members. And Farley's count includes resolutions, 23 of which passed in the Senate. Farley paints Gillibrand as a lawmaker without any legislative victories. That’s not true. Her statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-03385	Women in the United States are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/09/jimmy-carter/carter-trips-over-details-gender-wage-gap/	PolitiFact Georgia checked two previous claims former President Jimmy Carter made in a Time magazine interview before his "Mobilizing Faith for Women" conference last month at the Carter Center. Once the three-day conference began, various media outlets and bloggers reported some of the goings on. The Huffington Post, for example, wrote about one session in which Carter discussed mistreatment of women across the world and laid the blame, at least some of it, at the feet of religious leaders. One familiar statement about the pay disparity between men and women stuck out to us: Carter said women in the United States are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. Can that really be true? Our national and state affiliate PolitiFact colleagues have completed several fact checks of similar wage-disparity claims made by a variety of politicos including President Barack Obama. We dug a little deeper to determine where Carter’s claim ranked on the Truth-O-Meter. We tracked down the full statement in a 20-minute video of the former president and former Georgia governor’s comments on the Carter Center’s website. Carter’s comments on this subject begin around the 7:30 mark as he reads articles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 23, he reads, says everyone, without any discrimination, has a right to equal pay for equal work. "And the employers of America looking at their religious ordination that women are not equal don't feel constrained to pay women equally for the same work that a man does," Carter continues. "In our country, women get an average of 70 percent as much pay for doing exactly the same work as men." The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948 after World War II as a road map to guarantee the rights of every individual everywhere, according to the UDHR’s website. Carter’s overall theme of an existing gender wage gap is correct. But his figure and characterization of that amount is a very different matter. We contacted Carter’s camp about his source for the claim. It noted the U.N. 2012 report, "Progress of the World’s Women: In Pursuit of Justice." But that report cites an international pay gap of 10 percent to 30 percent for 83 countries polled, and it doesn’t provide a percentage for the United States. The report does say that the wage gaps reflect the fact that women doing the same or comparable jobs are paid less than men for the same work. The report is based on a 2008 International Labour Organization data. Nationally, the 70 percent figure seems to track back to a 2011 census report that found that in 2010, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers over age 15 was 0.77; meaning that women earned 77 cents for every dollar a man earned. That statistic has been used repeatedly as an argument for equal pay and gender non-discrimination legislation. But the statistic has also been widely misused by speakers oversimplifying the data. The report does not say the 77-cent figure is for the same work. And the full-time definition for different jobs can vary widely. Also, the pay gap does not take into account other factors that could influence the figure, including occupation, time on the job and education level. The census report showed the widest gap. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as, data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller gaps. The 70 percent figure, also taken from census data, is the wage disparity between men and African-American women. Again, the figure was based on full-time, year-round workers in general, and it did not compare similar occupations. The wage gap increased to 64 percent (or 64 cents to every dollar) between black women and white, non-Hispanic men. So, does Carter’s claim earn an honest day’s pay? During a conference on women, Carter said that women in this country earn just 70 percent of what men earn for "doing exactly the same work as men." His main source document provides information on an international, not a national wage gap. And for this country, the figure Carter uses is actually the wage gap between all men and black women. It has nothing to do with men and women who do the same work, contrary to what he stated. Even if we assume Carter misspoke and meant 77 percent -- the most widely used wage gap figure from a recent census report -- his claim would still leave out important details about the census data that would give an entirely different impression had they been included. The former president and Nobel Prize winner does get some credit for his overall theme that a general pay gap persists between men and women, a fact that has been proved by various sets of national data.

pomt-06219	President Barack Obama "has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/06/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-barack-obama-has-killed-jobs-en/	During a Dec. 5, 2011, news conference, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich took aim at President Barack Obama’s record on jobs. "I think the president has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing, he kills jobs in virtually every part of American life. I mean, notice -- the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created." We’re going to check this statement in two parts. In this item, we’ll check the claim that President Barack Obama "has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing." In a separate item, we’ll check the claim that "the only reason the unemployment rate is going down is because … twice as many people dropped out of the employment pool as the number of jobs were created." For this item, we're focusing on Gingrich’s claim’s about energy and manufacturing jobs. We used data showing net changes in jobs -- that is, jobs created minus jobs lost -- rather than just jobs lost (or "killed"). We are also interpreting Gingrich’s comment to mean that Obama is the cause for killing existing jobs, not that Obama has prevented theoretical future jobs from materializing. Now, to the numbers, which are collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We looked at two time periods -- one between January 2009 and November 2011, which represents the entirety of Obama’s time in office, and the other between January 2010 and November 2011, which covers the period starting one year into his presidency, a point at which one would assume that Obama’s policies have begun to have some impact. Energy jobs For energy, we found two relevant categories in the BLS data, oil and gas extraction and mining. During the entire Obama presidency, employment in the oil and gas extraction sector grew by 18,800 jobs, or an increase of 11 percent. Over the same period, jobs in mining declined by 9,200, or 4 percent. Combining the two categories, energy jobs grew by 9,600 jobs, or 2 percent. Beginning one year into Obama’s presidency, oil and gas extraction jobs increased by 27,500, a rise of 18 percent. Mining jobs grew by 14,900, or 8 percent. Combined, the two sectors increased by 42,400 jobs, or 12 percent. So over both periods, the energy sector grew in absolute terms -- and if you measure beginning in January 2010, the increase has been quite healthy at 12 percent over two years. Manufacturing jobs During the entire Obama presidency, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined by 795,000, or 6 percent. Since January 2010, though, the number of manufacturing jobs has increased by 299,000, a rise of 2.6 percent over two years. The increase since January 2010 is modest -- a bit over 1 percent per year -- and it hasn’t come close to bringing manufacturing employment back up to the level it was when Obama was inaugurated in the midst of a severe recession. Yet the rise in Obama’s second and third year becomes more robust once it’s put into historical context. In general, manufacturing employment has declined more or less steadily since the mid-1970s. The last time manufacturing jobs saw such a large and sustained numerical increase was in the early 1990s. So while the increase in years two and three of the Obama presidency is relatively small, it is the best in about two decades. One way to illustrate the long-term decline of manufacturing jobs is to look at how the numbers have moved during the past few presidencies. In the list below, we began counting from one year into each president’s tenure through to the end of their term. Using that methodology, here are the numbers of manufacturing jobs gained or lost per year: Barack Obama: Increase of 157,368 manufacturing jobs per year in office George W. Bush: Decrease of 434,143 manufacturing jobs per year in office Bill Clinton: Increase of 37,143 manufacturing jobs per year in office George H.W. Bush: Decrease of 336,000 manufacturing jobs per year in office Ronald Reagan: Increase of 1,429 manufacturing jobs per year in office Jimmy Carter: Increase of 15,333 manufacturing jobs per year in office So by this measure, manufacturing jobs have actually increased by more under Obama than under any of his recent predecessors. A final note: It’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, conversely, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have ruled that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims less than True on our Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling Gingrich is free to argue that environmental regulations, tax policies and the like have prevented the energy and manufacturing sectors from creating as many jobs as they otherwise might. But in this case, Ginrgich said that Obama "has now spent three years proving that he kills jobs in energy, he kills jobs in manufacturing." That’s a different standard, one which means that Obama’s policies have destroyed existing jobs on a net basis. Right off the bat, we need to downgrade Gingrich’s statement due to its allocation of blame. The job market is subject to many factors, not just Obama’s policies, so it’s unfair to lay all of the blame on the president. But even on the numbers, the claim’s accuracy is mixed at best. Combined, energy extraction jobs have increased in absolute numbers since Obama took office and have risen quite rapidly over the past two years.

pomt-13558	"Hillary [Clinton] wants to raise taxes by over a trillion dollars."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/25/mike-pence/pa-pence-repeats-half-true-claim-clinton-would-rai/	During a campaign stop in Bucks County this week, Indiana Gov. and Donald Trump’s running mate Mike Pence made an ear-catching claim about Hillary Clinton’s tax plan. "Hillary," he said, "wants to raise taxes by over a trillion dollars." That claim was also made in April by New Day for America, a super PAC that was working to elect Ohio Gov. John Kasich as the Republican nominee for president. PolitiFact rated the claim Half-True. Here's why: To put that $1 trillion number in perspective, the national debt has reached nearly $19.2 trillion, or more than $60,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. PolitiFact has looked at the presidential candidates' tax plans and, for the Clinton proposal, we relied on a March 3, 2016, analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. The center says that Clinton's proposal would indeed increase tax revenue by $1 trillion — $1.1 trillion in fact. But that money would be raised over 10 years. Clinton, even if she were elected in November and reelected in 2020, wouldn't be in office that long. Reagan's message on behalf of New Day misses another point that may make the increase less onerous to most voters: "Nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent; the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes," according to the report. For example, filers with an adjusted gross income higher than $1 million would have to pay an effective tax rate of 30 percent. Any money earned above $5 million per year would be assessed an extra 4 percent surcharge. (The surcharge would kick in at $2.5 million for married couples filing separately.) Clinton's plan also aims to discourage multinational corporations from using various schemes to lower or eliminate the taxes they have to pay in the United States. However, according to the report, her proposal would make the tax code more complex and the higher tax rates for the people who earn the most money would reduce "incentives to work, save and invest." When we heard back from New Day for America, spokeswoman Connie Wehrkamp directed us to Clinton's interview with the New York Daily News and an analysis by the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, both of which make it clear that the $1 trillion would be raised over 10 years, a distinction made by neither New Day nor Reagan. "Liberals may think increasing taxes by $1 trillion is a good idea, but we very strongly disagree," Wehrkamp said in an email. Our Ruling New Day spokesman Michael Reagan said, "Hillary Clinton has promised to raise taxes by $1 trillion." Pence repeated a similar claim in Pennsylvania during a campaign stop this week, saying "Hillary wants to raise taxes by over a trillion dollars." Her plan does, in fact, call for raising a trillion dollars, but it would do so over 10 years — longer than she could serve as president, even if she were re-elected. So if she brought in roughly $100 billion per year, even a two-term Clinton administration couldn't fulfill a promise to bring the total to $1 trillion. Also, the statement ignores another key bit of data — that the money would be raised by tax changes targeted to the richest Americans, a group that has seen its top tax rate drop dramatically since the 1950s and early 1960s, when the marginal tax rate was over 90 percent. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-03570	Says Fulton County government hasn’t raised its millage rate since 1991.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/20/john-eaves/fulton-leader-uses-tax-rate-make-case-state-battle/	The year was 1991. U.S. military forces ousted Saddam Hussein’s troops from Kuwait in what was called Operation Desert Storm. The Atlanta Braves thrilled the city with an improbable World Series appearance. "The Silence of the Lambs" won the Oscar for Best Picture. Basketball legend Michael Jordan won his first pro championship. And Fulton County commissioners raised the millage rate, causing property taxes -- and anger -- to rise in Georgia’s highest-populated county. Now, Fulton officials are upset with state lawmakers, who passed a series of bills this year that the lawmakers believe will improve county operations. County Chairman John Eaves made the argument that Fulton is a well-run county in a recent television interview. "The facts are Fulton County has not increased its millage rate since 1991," Eaves told Channel 2 Action News’ Lori Geary. "So why fix something that’s not broken?" PolitiFact Georgia was curious whether Eaves was indeed correct about his claim that county commissioners haven’t raised the millage rate in more than two decades. For several years, Republican state lawmakers from north Fulton have battled with the Democratic-led County Commission over the direction of the county government. Many of the lawmakers and their constituents say they’re not getting their money’s worth in services for the taxes they pay. There’s been talk, and unsuccessful legislation at the state level, to split Fulton into two counties. Fulton has 920,583 residents, according to the 2010 U.S. census. The tax for general county services in Fulton is currently 10.281 mills, which equates to about $720 on a $250,000 home with a homestead exemption. But total property taxes in Fulton vary, depending on what part of the county the property is located. Cities add their own millage rates, increasing the overall rate. Then, there are other charges for bond payments, the county’s school system and other services. Fulton’s school board sets its own property tax rate. In 1991, county commissioners voted 4-3 to raise property taxes. Then Chairman Michael Lomax said the increase was necessary to help fund Grady Memorial Hospital. Some residents unsuccessfully tried to recall Lomax. Eaves was first elected as chairman in 2006. Since 1991, the county government’s millage and bond rate has gradually declined. In 2011, though, it rose from 10.28 mills to 10.55 mills to help fund a library construction program. Fulton voters passed the proposed $275 million library program in 2008. Fulton public affairs manager Jessica Corbitt told us the increase of 0.27 mills was to the bond millage rate, not the general fund millage rate. It was listed on Fulton tax bills as a separate millage rate. The county chairman’s comments, though, do not reflect some property tax changes in a portion of Fulton. The county has a Special Services District for a portion of its south Fulton residents. The Georgia Legislature created the district in 2006 after the cities of Chattahoochee Hills, Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs were all created. South Fulton leaders pushed for the district to ensure funding for services in that portion of the county as those cities, most of them in the north, were being created. The millage rate for the South Fulton Special Services District was 5.73 mills in 2006, county financial records show. It declined slightly to 5.66 mills in 2007 and 2008. The rate rose sharply in 2009 to 8.16 mills, the records show. It went up in 2011 to 8.97 mills and again in 2012 to 10.47 mills. The county said in its 2012 budget book that the most recent increase was primarily due to lower assessments on property values and that the county needed the additional money to maintain the same level of service to residents there. The increases are a direct result of the defections of Johns Creek, Milton and Sandy Springs, as well as plummeting property values brought on by the Great Recession, county officials have said. Corbitt confirmed the accuracy of the financial records. She defended Eaves’ statement in the television interview. "While it is true that the millage rate has increased for the special services district, which serves approximately 10 percent of the county’s population, the discussions related to the Fulton County legislation have primarily focused on the Countywide General Fund. With regard to the General Fund, the Chairman’s statement is completely accurate," Corbitt said via email. To sum up, Eaves said the county has not increased its millage rate since 1991. But the millage rate in the South Fulton Special Services Fund, which affects about 90,000 people, has increased several times in recent years. Corbitt said the south Fulton millage rate increases are not relevant to the ongoing debate. Still, Eaves would have been more precise if he had specified the difference. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	John Eaves	None	None	None	2013-05-20T06:00:00	2013-05-03	['None']
pomt-07875	"I didn't raise taxes once."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/07/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-he-didnt-raise-taxes/	In an interview on Super Bowl Sunday, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly asked President Barack Obama to react to a Wall Street Journal editorial that accused Obama of being "a determined man of the left whose goal is to redistribute much larger levels of income across society." "Do you deny that you are a man who wants to redistribute wealth?" O'Reilly asked. Obama first noted the conservatism of the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, then denied the charge "absolutely." "I didn't raise taxes once. I lowered taxes over the last two years," Obama said. We wanted to fact-check that statement, and we'll begin by saying Obama boils down an awful lot of complexity about federal tax policy into a short sound bite. Looking at the whole statement, he's both right and wrong. For clarity's sake, we're going to take Obama's statement in two parts. Here, we'll look at his statement, "I didn't raise taxes once." In a separate report, we'll look at his statement, "I lowered taxes over the last two years." The idea that Obama did not raise taxes is just plain wrong. He signed legislation raising taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products soon after taking office; that money goes to pay for children's health insurance programs. The law went into effect in 2009. He also signed the health care law, which includes taxes on indoor tanning that went into effect last year. (Regular PolitiFact readers will remember our fact-check of reality TV star Snooki and her complaint about the new tax last year.) The new health care law also includes a tax on people who decide not to have health insurance, as an incentive for them to get coverage. The tax phases in gradually, starting in 2014. By 2016, the tax would be $695 per uninsured person up to a maximum of three times that amount, or $2,085. The law includes exemptions for people who can't find affordable insurance, and a few other special circumstances. More significantly, the health care law includes new taxes on the wealthy, starting in 2013. Individuals who make more than $200,000 and couples that make more than $250,000 will see additional Medicare taxes of 0.9 percent. They will also, for the first time, have to pay Medicare taxes on their investment income at a 3.8 percent rate. (Current law is that all workers and employers split a 2.9 percent Medicare tax; the self-employed pay all of it.) The small percentages may not sound like a lot, but those taxes are expected to generate $210 billion over 10 years, or just over half of all the new revenues the health care law authorizes. Other provisions include new fees on health insurance companies and prescription drug manufacturers, and a new tax on high-cost "Cadillac" health insurance plans. Before we rule on this item, though, we should note that Obama has not raised income taxes. Thanks to a compromise he brokered with Republicans at the end of 2010, income tax rates are staying the same for people of all incomes. Obama had favored raising taxes on high earners, but he gave up on that as part of the tax deal. In exchange, he gained a a 2 percent reduction in payroll taxes for all workers. When you combine that with small tax cuts that were part of the economic stimulus, most taxpayers have seen reduced rates under Obama's administration. Obama said, "I didn't raise taxes once." But we've documented numerous instances when he has. He's has signed off on small tax cuts for most taxpayers, but that doesn't change the fact that he's also approved several tax increases. So we rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-02-07T15:00:53	2011-02-06	['None']
pomt-09216	"Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/19/national-republican-congressional-committee/walt-minnick-attacked-abortion-issues-tied-obamaca/	During the heat of the federal health care debate earlier this year, abortion foes warned they would make legislators' votes on abortion provisions well known in future campaigns. Well that didn't take long. In a heated Idaho congressional race, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has launched a TV ad targeting incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Walt Minnick for several votes it claims supported taxpayer-funded abortions. Minnick is facing a challenge from two Republican contenders, Raul Labrador and Vaughn Ward. The ad uses one of those baseball pitch-trackers as the visual. Here's the voiceover: "Is Walt Minnick voting your values? Minnick voted to allow direct taxpayer funding of abortion-on-demand in Washington. Strike One. Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare. Strike two. Then, Minnick voted to keep in place the extreme abortion provisions of Obamacare. Strike three. When it comes to representing our values, Walt Minnick's striking out. Call Minnick. And tell him to stop voting for taxpayer funded abortion." We're betting we're going to see a lot of ads like this in the next six months. And so we're focusing on the most universal aspect of the ad, the claim that "Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare." Minnick is an abortion rights advocate, but the ad goes one step further, saying he voted repeatedly for taxpayer funding for abortions. First, a little bit about what those three votes were (and were not). 1) "Minnick voted to allow direct taxpayer funding of abortion-on-demand in Washington." This was a vote related specifically to the District of Columbia on July 16, 2009. A spending bill proposed removing special restrictions which had prohibited the District of Columbia city government from using local tax funds to pay for abortions for the poor (as all the 50 states are permitted to do). Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., offered an amendment to keep the restriction. The amendment was blocked by a narrow 219-208 vote; and Minnick was among those who voted against allowing the amendment to move forward. The bill did not direct federal tax dollars to cover abortions. It gave city legislators the power to decide if they want to steer local tax dollars toward abortion services. 2) "Minnick voted to let the government fund abortion under Obamacare." This relates to the much-publicized Stupak Amendment offered to the House version of the massive health care reform bill in the fall of 2009. Championed by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., the amendment took a hard line on abortion, barring anyone who accepted federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. The amendment would have let people choose a plan with abortion coverage if they paid for it without using federal subsidies. Minnick voted against the Stupak amendment, but it passed and was part of the health care bill that originally passed in the House. 3) "Minnick voted to keep in place the extreme abortion provisions of Obamacare." The Senate version of the health care reform package took a different tack on abortion. The Senate language, written by an abortion opponent, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., allowed companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But the provision included detailed measures to ensure federal tax dollars would not be used to fund abortion services. When the Senate version of the bill came back to the House for consideration, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., sought to have the bill changed to reflect the earlier Stupak language. That effort failed, and Minnick was among those who killed it. But Minnick ultimately voted against the health care bill. He's a member of the House Blue Dog coalition. His vote against the health care bill, along with his vote against the economic stimulus package, goes a long way toward explaining why he was the lone Democrat endorsed by the Tea Party Express, a national group that organized a tour this spring featuring Sarah Palin, Joe the Plumber Wurzelbacher and others. Minnick is also a consistent abortion rights supporter. In 2009, NARAL Pro-Choice America gave him a 100 percent rating. But the charge in the ad is not just that Minnick supports abortion rights, it's that he voted to "let the government fund abortion under Obamacare" -- Strike Two in the ad. On Nov. 7, 2009, Minnick issued a press release explaining his vote against the Stupak Amendment: "I believe abortion should be safe, legal and rare, and that a decision on the issue can be made only by a woman, her family, her doctor and her pastor. "I do not want a federal judge overruling that decision. I do not want a government bureaucrat denying a medical procedure ordered by a woman’s physician. I do not want this Congress to give an anonymous insurance executive an excuse to gut coverage for women's health. "One of the reasons I oppose the House health care bill is that I do not believe the federal government should be making health care decisions for Americans. It is also why I oppose this amendment." The assumption made in the ad is that a vote against the Stupak Amendment was a vote to let the government fund abortion. We explored that issue in depth during the health care debate and concluded similar claims were inaccurate. The alternative in play prior to the Stupak Amendment was to make abortion coverage available in private plans participating in the exchange, but requiring that such services be paid through patient premiums, not federal tax dollars. The version of the bill that passed the Senate also allowed companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill required that anyone who selected a plan that covers abortion must pay $1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services. Before signing off on that abortion language, Stupak convinced President Barack Obama to issue an executive order providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled. And Stupak, who up until that point had been the champion of the abortion foes' position, declared "There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation." That's where things stood when the third vote mentioned in the ad came up. So let's review: The first vote mentioned in the ad was not exactly a vote for taxpayer-funded abortion, though that may be its result. The bill allowed District of Columbia city government to steer local tax dollars toward abortion services for the poor. But that would be the call of local officials in D.C., and it wouldn't result in federal tax dollars going to abortion. The other two votes relate to "Obamacare." Again, Minnick cast the votes cited in the ad, but ultimately voted against the health care bill. Moreover, we think it's inaccurate to claim that Minnick's vote against the Stupak Amendment was a vote to "let the government fund abortion under Obamacare." The Stupak Amendment certainly took a harder line on the abortion issue, barring those who accepted federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage. It's fair to say the Stupak amendment would have kept federal tax dollars from subsidizing abortions. But that doesn't mean that, conversely, a vote against it therefore allowed it. The alternative was to make abortion services available in health care exchanges, but paid entirely with patient premiums, not tax dollars. And so we rule the claim in the NRCC ad False.

pomt-03516	"We cut taxes 24 times."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/jun/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-claims-24-tax-cuts-florida-2011/	How many times did Gov. Rick Scott cut taxes? You better believe the unpopular Republican running for a second term is counting the ways. "Twenty-four times," Scott said last month after signing the state’s $71.1 billion budget. The claim certainly got our attention at PolitiFact Florida. Could Scott and the Legislature have enacted two dozen different tax cuts in just three budget years, two of which were hamstrung by billion-dollar budget shortfalls? We turned to the Truth-O-Meter to sort it out. What Scott counts Defining a "tax cut" can be difficult. To Scott, it means anything that reduced government revenue by $3 million in any given year. So, for instance, a three-day sales tax holiday is a tax cut in Scott’s mind. And because it’s been in the budget the past three years, it’s counted as three tax cuts. (Actually, Scott says it’s four. More on that later.) Other "tax cuts" are really reductions in automatic fee increases or tax credits, and several are temporary. We’ll discuss whether they can be considered tax cuts in a moment. First, let’s go through Scott’s list. (His office actually provided 25, not 24.) 1, 2.) Unemployment compensation taxes:Lawmakers spared businesses from paying higher taxes in 2011 by reducing the number of weeks and payout for unemployment compensation. It saved businesses $124.5 million. The next year, the Legislature rolled back a tax increase businesses were supposed to pay. The change meant businesses still paid more than in previous years, but not as much as originally anticipated. The savings -- on paper -- to businesses: $830 million for tax years 2012 through 2014. 3, 4.) Manufacturing equipment: Scott signed an expansion of a sales tax exemption on machinery purchases in 2012, worth $56 million. In 2013, lawmakers eliminated the sales tax entirely, at least temporarily. The tax will be eliminated for three years starting in April 2014. Removing the sales tax, which faces constitutional questions, would cost the state $370 million and local governments $83 million through 2017. 5.) Property taxes: In 2011, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections by about 30 percent, leading to about $210 million in savings for property owners. This resulted in modest property tax savings for most Floridians, except those in northwest Florida, whose district did not have to reduce its tax rate, according to a bill analysis. 6, 7, 8, 9.) Sales tax holiday: Scott counts the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday four different times. It applies to shoes and clothing (up to $75/item) and school supply purchases (up to $15). The state has offered the holiday every year since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009. The price tag is about $30 million to the state. The 2013 tax holiday (Aug. 2-4) counts twice, according to Scott, because it also exempts sales taxes on electronic equipment, such as E-readers, laptops and tablets, up to $750. State economists expect Floridians to save $4.7 million. 10, 11.) Corporate Income Tax exemptions: Per Scott’s wishes, the Legislature expanded the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and again in 2012 to $50,000. The hit to the state budget for both is about $60 million a year, sparing thousands of businesses from paying the tax. (Scott wanted to eliminate this tax outright when he took office, but he has scaled back his approach to placate the Legislature.) 12.) Tax credit scholarships: This expands a program that gives businesses a tax credit if they purchase tuition vouchers for low-income families to go to private schools. The trade-off results in a loss of $25 million in state revenue. 13, 14, 15.) Energy breaks: One 2013 law implements part of a 2008 constitutional amendment that says a property appraiser may not base an increase in a property’s just value on the installation of a "renewable energy source device," including windmills, solar panels and roof pools. The law may lead to local revenue losses of $12.6 million by 2017, according to state analysts. It will not go into effect until tax year 2014. Two other credits are in a 2012 bill, HB 7117, aimed at inspiring more renewable energy production in our natural gas-dependent state. These credits, which could help agribusiness and renewable energy production facilities, are set to expire in 2016. Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature. The department has received five applications for the renewable energy production tax credit, but none has yet been issued. 16, 17, 18, 19.) Various business tax incentives: Since 2011, the Legislature and Scott have done the following: Expanded tax credits available to businesses under a federal/state "new markets" program, allowing businesses to take it against their corporate income tax bill or insurance premium tax bill. ($12.9 million loss/year) Allowed certain companies, which spent at least $250 million on capital costs from 2011-13, to write-down a portion of their Florida business taxes. ($7.5 million loss/year) Temporarily waived a requirement that a new facility creating at least 100 jobs be in certain technology fields in order to qualify for the Capital Investment Tax Credit, though only if they are located in certain Panhandle counties. The exemption lasts through June 30, 2014. ($4.4 million loss/year) Created an annual corporate income tax credit for certain research and development expenses of up to $9 million a year. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.) Targeted breaks: Lawmakers eliminated sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds, worth $12.3 million. The same bill tweaked requirements for a tax credit for businesses in an urban high-crime area ($3.5 million/year). They blocked an automatic inflation adjustment factored in registration for hunting and fishing license fees every five years. Eliminating the increase, which would have taken effect July 2013, cost the state $4.4 million for 2012-13. They tinkered with a formula for the tax owed by Floridians who sever phosphate rock to sell. To put it very simply, a wide-ranging 2012 law eliminates the annual adjustment and surcharge for severing phosphate for an annual cost of $12.6 million. A person licensed as a real estate salesperson or broker associate does not have to apply for an exemption from a local business tax when he or she is an employee of someone else under a 2012 law. ($3.8 million hit to local government/year.) 25.) Communications dealers: HB 809 in 2012 spared communications dealers, in certain situations, from being liable for penalties if they assign a customer to the wrong local tax jurisdiction (local governments can add hikes to this tax on top of the state rate). The change will result in annual savings of about $4.7 million for the communications industry. True tax cuts? That’s the evidence. What to make of it? After speaking with experts and considering the evidence, we found numerous caveats -- some more noteworthy than others. Some cuts are temporary and others are very narrowly targeted. The three-day sales tax holiday counts four times on Scott’s list (Nos. 6-9). "Does it really count as a tax cut if you’ve been providing it since 1998?" said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Other cuts are not really cuts but credits, which mean you have to spend somewhere to save somewhere else. The energy legislation (No. 13) prevents property appraisers from raising someone’s property taxes for making energy-efficient home improvements. That’s not a cut in the literal sense. The break for communications dealers (No. 25) is not so much a tax cut as it is the removal of a penalty. And while changes in unemployment compensation rules save businesses money (No. 1), they also take money away from out-of-work Floridians. "It’s a tax cut for employers, but who’s really paying for it? Unemployed workers," said Karen Woodall, director of the left-leaning Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, pointing to a committee analysis. The elimination of the scheduled increase in license and registration fees for hunting and fishing (No. 22) is not a tax cut in the truest sense because it applies only to people using a certain service. "Americans don’t like the word ‘tax’," said Scott Drenkard, Tax Foundation economist at the Center for State Tax Policy. "It’s a holdover from the Revolutionary War. The word ‘fee’ is a little bit more generous." Readers may hear Scott’s statement and rush toward to their tax bills, eager to see all the ways it is reduced. But the truth is that most of the breaks are for business. "There is very little in that that provides some benefit to the average working person," said state Rep. Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach. Besides the caveats, there’s also another thing to consider: Are there places Floridians are being asked to pay more? Scott considers raising tuition a tax increase, which is why he vetoed a 3 percent increase in the 2013-14 budget. However, he signed an 8 percent tuition increase into law in 2011 and a 5 percent tuition increase for colleges in 2012. Another 2013 law will require state and local government to contribute $900 million in 2013-14 to the state retirement system. Local officials have already said they may have to increase taxes to cope with the new cost. In other cases of lost revenue to local government, it’s unclear if local officials made up the difference by cutting services or raising taxes. Our ruling Scott said, "We cut taxes 24 times." The evidence backs him up, to a point. Lawmakers and Scott have done several things to reduce the financial burden on groups of Floridians, but the benefits have been aimed mostly at business owners -- not average working people. If you don't own a business, you haven't seen most of these cuts. Using such a specific number is also troublesome. Backing up that specific claim requires overlooking all sorts of caveats, including counting the same effort multiple times. Scott’s tax claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2013-06-03T17:13:49	2013-05-21	['None']
pomt-01376	Under my platform, "I will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/16/tom-cotton/tom-cotton-says-he-wouldnt-back-changes-those-medi/	During a debate in the hotly contested Arkansas Senate race, Republican Tom Cotton and Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor squared off over the question of Medicare and how it would be affected by the Affordable Care Act, the health care law sometimes called Obamacare. A moderator kicked off the exchange by noting that TV ads in the race had made several claims about possible changes to Medicare and where the candidates stood on those changes. Pryor was asked, "What specifically would you change about the current system, if anything?" Pryor answered by parrying a charge that he had voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare by voting for Obamacare. (We have rated Cotton’s earlier claim that Pryor "cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare" by $700 billion Half True.) In fact, Pryor said that Cotton "has voted for that very same $700 billion (cut) he loves to criticize me for." (We rated a close variation of that claim True.) When given an opportunity to respond, Cotton took the questioner’s claim head-on. Cotton said, "The answer to your question is: I will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement." We wondered if that was what his platform really shows. The answer hinges on two separate questions. First, Does Cotton support repeal of Obamacare? And second, if Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare either for current retirees or people approaching retirement? The short answers are yes and yes. Here are the more detailed explanations. Does Cotton support the repeal of Obamacare? Cotton’s staff didn’t return an inquiry from PolitiFact, but we found lots of examples of Cotton arguing that Obamacare should be repealed. • "I will fight to repeal and replace Obamacare with free-market reforms that empower patients and doctors to make health-care decisions. … Obamacare must be repealed entirely." -- Cotton’s House of Representatives office website, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. • I "will fight to repeal Obamacare." -- Cotton’s Facebook page, accessed Oct. 15, 2014. • "What we have to do is repeal Obamacare, start over, and get it right." -- Cotton at a press conference with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Aug 21, 2014. • "We would repeal Obamacare and replace it entirely with many reforms for our health care program." -- Cotton at a press conference, April 13, 2014 • And most clearly, a pledge Cotton signed that says, "I pledge to vote for all bills which seek to REPEAL the health care bill, HR 3590, signed into law on March 23, 2010. To that end, I do now and will in the next Congress endorse and vote for all measures, including discharge petitions, leading to its defunding, deauthorization, and repeal. I shall do so whether those measures are taken for the whole of the bill or those component parts that impose mandates, restrict patient and doctor choice and access, violate individual freedom and privacy, reduce healthy competition, increase costs, or raise taxes." It’s worth noting that, at times, Cotton has expressed a desire to "replace" the newly repealed law with something else. However, we’ve failed to uncover an instance in which Cotton provided a detailed description of the Medicare policies that would be reinstated after a repeal. Cotton has also expressed an openness to more limited efforts, such as defunding the law, if a repeal can’t be achieved. Still, it’s clear from these comments that repeal is his first choice. Bottom line: Yes, Cotton has said consistently that he wants to repeal the law. If Obamacare is repealed, would that prompt changes to Medicare for current beneficiaries? It would. The highest-profile element of the law that would disappear in the event of a full repeal is the closing of the "doughnut hole." The law made strides to ease the previous, longstanding gap in coverage for beneficiaries in which they weren’t able to get government subsidies for prescription drug purchases under Medicare Part D. However, this isn’t the only example of a benefit included in the Affordable Care Act that would disappear for those currently on Medicare if the law is repealed and replacement provisions aren’t specifically enacted. Here are others, gleaned from the Kaiser Family Foundation’s summary of the health care law: • Elimination of cost-sharing for Medicare-covered preventive services. • Authorization of Medicare coverage of "personalized prevention plan services," including an annual, comprehensive health-risk assessment. • Incentives to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to complete behavior-modification programs, such as smoking cessation. • Reduction in the out-of-pocket amount that qualifies an enrollee for catastrophic coverage for prescriptions. • Expansion of Medicare coverage to individuals who have been exposed to environmental health hazards from living in an area subject to an emergency declaration made as of June 17, 2009, and have developed certain health conditions as a result. • Prohibition of Medicare Advantage plans from imposing higher cost-sharing requirements for some Medicare-covered benefits than is required under the traditional fee-for-service program. In other words, current Medicare beneficiaries would feel a significant impact if a replacement law is not forthcoming after a repeal. We see no evidence that Cotton has pledged to protect any of these specific provisions in the wake of a repeal. Our ruling Cotton said that under his platform, he "will make no changes to the current (Medicare) system for current retirees and anyone approaching retirement." Cotton has consistently supported repeal of Obamacare, and while he has sometimes noted that something needs to be enacted to "replace" the law, we couldn’t find any examples in which he specifically pledged to protect the Medicare policies that would be eliminated if the law was repealed, such as the closing of the doughnut hole and free preventive health-care services. We rate his claim False.	None	Tom Cotton	None	None	None	2014-10-16T10:29:17	2014-10-14	['None']
pomt-02401	Under a bill before the legislature, "you’d have to go to court to fire an employee."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/mar/10/kenneth-block/ken-block-says-under-bill-ri-legislature-youd-have/	In his campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Kenneth Block has been arguing that a big reason why Rhode Island’s economy is stagnant is that the state has too many laws, rules and regulations that increase costs and impede the ability of businesses to rapidly respond to changing conditions. In a March 2 appearance on WJAR-10’s "News Conference" Block cited as an example a bill introduced in the General Assembly this session that he said would interfere with an employer’s ability to dismiss employees. "We had a legislator put in a bill to remove the ability of an employer to fire an employee, it’d end up in court, you’d have to go to court to fire an employee," he said. We wanted to see if Block had just cause to make that claim. We called Block’s campaign and they promptly identified the proposed legislation, House Bill 7055, introduced in January by state Rep. K. Joseph Shekarchi, D-Warwick. The bill would add language to the state law on employee rights stating that no employee in the state can be fired if the dismissal is against "an explicit, well established public policy of the state" or if the employee "has an implied contractual right to employment." Those phrases are significant because, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Rhode Island is one of only three states (Florida and Georgia are the other two) that are known as "at-will" employment states. "‘At will’ means an employee can be discharged at any time, for good reason, bad reason or no reason at all," said Michael J. Yelnosky, dean of the Roger Williams University Law School and an employment law specialist. He said the only limit on ability to fire is if the reason is explicitly against the law, such a racial discrimination. He said Shekarchi’s bill wouldn’t prevent an employer from firing an employee. What it would do, he said, is give a dismissed employee two possible arguments that could be used in a subsequent lawsuit to overturn the firing. An employee might claim he was fired because he refused to do something that was against the law. Or, he might argue there was an implied contract, if, for example, the employer had repeatedly promised the employee he’d always have a job, Yelnosky said. In other words, the bill would make it easier for a fired employee to file a lawsuit to try to get his job back. We contacted Block’s campaign and they referred us to a Jan. 16 news release Block issued on Shekarchi’s bill. In that statement, Block said if the bill passed "it would give every terminated employee the opportunity to claim that he or she had an implied contractual right to keep the job." Block campaign policy director Matthew Schweich said the March 2 "News Conference" statement was "a simplified version of the original statement." Not exactly. On "News Conference," Block said an employer would have to go to court to fire an employee. And that’s just not true. Nothing in the bill prevents a firing or requires an employer to get preliminary judicial approval. If Block had stuck to his better-worded news release, he’d have been right. We rule Block’s statement False. (Correction: Matthew Schweich is the policy director for the Block campaign. The initial version of this item incorrectly identified him as the campaign manager.)

pomt-13130	"Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/02/donald-trump/trump-says-twitter-google-facebook-buried-clinton-/	Have you heard the news that the FBI is looking into new emails related to Hillary Clinton? If you haven’t, Donald Trump says it may be because social media companies are suppressing the news. "Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!" the Republican presidential candidate tweeted Oct. 30. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress Oct. 28 that said the FBI may have found new emails relevant to its probe into the private email server that Clinton used while secretary of state. The FBI plans to review these new emails to see if they contain classified information. There’s no evidence to support Trump’s claim that Twitter, Google and Facebook buried this story in the first couple days after it broke. We reached out to the Trump campaign for its evidence and received no response. Sure, the FBI story come out on a Friday, so it competed on social media with users’ upcoming Halloween plans, the World Series and other events. But the topic was certainly popular. Twitter Twitter doesn’t have an algorithm to highlight or suppress stories, said Jen Golbeck, a University of Maryland professor and social networks expert. In their feeds, users see everything posted by the people they follow. If Trump was referring to Twitter’s "moments" feature, the FBI story appears on an accessible archived screenshot of the "moments" homepage the evening before he tweeted his claim. The website Mashable took a screenshot of Twitter’s featured tweets, which Twitter displays when a logged-out user visits Twitter.com, around the time Trump tweeted. One of the top three featured tweets was about the FBI story. According to the Twitter trend-tracking website Hashtagify, #ClintonEmails, #Comey, and #FBI surged in popularity over the past week, especially since the story broke. Google Google can intentionally suppress topics by tweaking its algorithm, but the company denies that it does this in relation to the election. "It would have to be an intentional choice, and that's a big deal," Golbeck said. In any case, it does not appear Google is doing that in this case. For example, over the weekend of Oct. 28-30, the FBI was the top trending Google search topic. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com And CNN’s Brian Stelter took a screenshot of Google News in the minutes after Trump tweeted his claim, and the FBI story was at the top of the list. Facebook Facebook is a bit harder to pin down. It does have the ability to suppress or highlight stories by altering its algorithm, though no one has produced evidence that this is something Facebook did with the FBI story. Further, Facebook tailors its trending topics based on the particular user’s interests. So the FBI story may not have appeared in one person’s trending topics bar, while appearing in another’s. While these companies probably don’t suppress certain stories, it’s hard to disprove a claim like Trump’s beyond a shadow of a doubt because there are so many ways social media sites could manipulate content visibility, said Kjerstin Thorson, a communications professor at Michigan State University. "Did it appear on people’s trending box space on Facebook? How long was it there? Was it trending only for some people and not for others? Was the story made visible in people’s Facebook news feeds or Twitter streams or in Google search results, via each platform’s display algorithm?" Thorson said. "Outside of internal company data, there is no source I know of who could check that." Our ruling Trump said, "Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!" Trump has not produced any evidence whatsoever to back up his claim, nor has anyone else. We found nothing to support the idea that the three tech and social media companies reduced the visibility of the latest developments in the Clinton email controversy. The burden is on Trump to produce information to support his statement. He’s offered none. Meanwhile, we’ve found plenty of evidence to contradict Trump’s claim. This claim rates False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/43b1a3fc-2ae2-4c51-9b6d-0f45b13d2d44	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-02T17:08:12	2016-10-30	['Bill_Clinton', 'Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation', 'Facebook', 'Google', 'Twitter']
pomt-00095	"Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-democrats-oppose-any-e/	As President Donald Trump campaigned in Wisconsin for Republicans seeking election in November, he turned to a repeated line of attack against Democrats on immigration. "Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border," Trump said Oct. 24 in Mosinee, Wis., prompting boos from rally-goers. Trump went on to claim that construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall was underway: "We started the wall, $1.6 billion, another $1.6 billion, and we have another, but we want to build it very quickly all at one time, and we'll get it done." It’s Mostly False that his promised border wall is under construction — what’s in the works is replacement fencing. His claim that Democrats oppose any effort to secure the border is also untrue. Democrats generally oppose the border wall, saying it would be too expensive and not in line with Trump’s promise that Mexico would pay for it. But they favor other security measures, including more Border Patrol agents and technology surveillance. They’ve introduced and co-sponsored legislation toward those goals. And the $1.6 billion Trump claims is financing the border wall came from a $1.3 trillion spending package passed in the House and Senate with support from Democrats. The White House did not provide supporting evidence for Trump’s claim nor comment on the record. Border fencing plan received Democratic support Trump in March reluctantly signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill, setting aside his threats to veto it because it did not include all the money he wanted for a border wall. The bill included $1.6 billion explicitly designated for new and replacement fencing along the southwest border. That amount also covered $38 million for border barrier planning and design, and $196 million for acquisition and deployment of border security technology. Although the appropriations bill said the money was for fencing, Trump has touted it as being money for the wall he promised. In his claims, he’s left out that some Democrats supported the measure. The spending package passed in the Senate, 65-32, with 39 Democrats voting in its favor. In the House, it passed 256-167, with 111 Democrats supporting it. Border security legislation Democrats have criticized a full-length version of Trump’s proposed border wall as a waste of money. Instead most have pushed for other ways to secure the border. They also opposed a June immigration bill introduced by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., (which Trump initially supported). Aside from border wall funding, Goodlatte’s bill included cuts to legal immigration and allowed so-called Dreamers to stay in the United States on a renewable nonimmigrant status. Democrats and moderate Republicans said the bill did not offer a permanent solution for Dreamers. Over the years, Democrats have sponsored and supported proposals to help secure the border and voted in favor of appropriation bills funding U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency in charge of enforcing immigration laws at the border. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York in 2013 sponsored a bill directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures. The Senate passed the bill but it was not taken up in the House. More recently, 30 Democrats co-sponsored a House bill introduced in January by Republican Rep. Will Hurd of Texas. The bill intended to protect Dreamers from deportation. It also called for the deployment of "the most practical and effective technology" to achieve operational control of the border. Within a year of the bill’s enactment, it directed the Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a comprehensive southern border strategy that included details on physical barriers, levees, technologies, tools, and other devices to secure the border. Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware and the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona in February sponsored legislation similar to Hurd’s House version. That proposal also authorized $110 million per year for five years for collaboration between local law enforcement and CBP. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., in January said that while the border wall was "a monumental waste of taxpayers’ money," he would be in favor of it if that’s what it took to help Dreamers. Our ruling Trump said, "Democrats oppose any effort to secure our border." Trump’s broad swipe fails to capture other actions under border security that Democrats have supported. Democrats have sponsored and backed legislation for border security, including surveillance technology. Trump also claims that the border wall is under construction and that he got $1.6 billion from Congress for it, but leaves out that Democrats also voted in favor of that appropriation. Trump’s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-10-30T17:32:24	2018-10-24	['None']
pomt-06148	Says Freddie Mac, electric co-ops and credit unions are all "government sponsored" enterprises.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/19/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-freddie-mac-electric-coo-ops-an/	Newt Gingrich’s relationship with Freddie Mac -- the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association -- has become a political briar patch for the former House speaker and Republican presidential candidate. His opponents, including Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry, cast him as a lobbyist in everything but name who landed over $1.6 million in fees from the one of the biggest players in the home mortgage industry. Gingrich states flatly he never lobbied on behalf of Freddie Mac, but in the last debate before the Iowa caucuses, Gingrich had to explain another wrinkle in his past dealings with Freddie. One of the panelists asked him about his words from 2007 "I like the GSE, or government sponsored enterprise like Freddie Mac, model." Gingrich took the broad view to defend his position, saying "when you look for example at electric membership co-ops, and you look at credit unions, there are a lot of government sponsored enterprises that are awfully important and do an awfully good job." So we ask, was that a fair comparison? Are electric co-ops and credit unions the same as government sponsored enterprises, GSE’s, like Freddie Mac? There is one similarity between a GSE and a credit union or an electric co-op. Neither pays federal or state income taxes. But Patrick Lavigne, spokesman for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), said GSE "is not a term that I’ve heard applied to electric coops before." Nor, as we learned, would he be likely to. The term GSE applies to just a handful of very particular institutions. It takes a specific act of congress to create one, usually to ease the flow of money to a certain industry, like housing or agriculture. Glossaries like Investopedia define GSE’s as "(p)rivately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy." When the White House submits its annual budget, it includes the GSE’s, and the list isn’t long. There are the Agricultural Credit Bank and Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. And that’s it. No electric co-ops.No credit unions. The 2012 White House budget explains that Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 to facilitate "the flow of investment dollars from the capital markets to mortgage lenders and ultimately, to homebuyers." A credit union or an electric co-op is born completely differently. They come into being only when a group of local investors pool their money.The country’s very first credit union was started in 1908 by a priest in Manchester, N.H., to provide credit to the factory workers in the textile mills. Washington played no role at all. Later, the federal government offered both funding assistance and regulatory guidelines. Local groups need to apply to a government agency for recognition as a nonprofit, member-owed entity. By the way, that’s another difference. Freddie Mac is owned by stockholders. Co-ops are owned by their members, the people who use them. Levine, with the NRECA, says electric co-ops started in the 1930’s when "farmers would each throw $5 dollars into the hat and then ask Washington for a loan for a transformer or some power lines." Back then, and today, those loans would come with a very low interest rate but a GSE such as Freddie Mac was treated even more favorably. It was formed with a direct line of credit into the federal Treasury -- upwards of $2 billion. "They could borrow money cheaper than anyone except Uncle Sam himself," said Kathleen Day, a former Washington Post reporter who covered the GSE’s for over two decades. The deal for Freddie Mac got even better. Thanks to that intimate association with the federal government, Day says "the markets perceived them as something that was backed by Washington and invested at a very low cost ... That’s what allowed it to grow." We asked the Gingrich campaign to send us any source that describes a credit union or a electric co-op as a GSE. We did not hear back. John Berlau, a policy director with the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank that supports limited government and free markets, says he knows of no such description. In an email, he wrote "credit union officials I have talked to are fearful that Gingrich's false claim that they are a type of GSE may unjustly harm their image among the public and legislators." Our Ruling: Gingrich spoke of credit unions and electric cooperatives as if they were the same sort of entities as Freddie Mac. We find no support for that and find major differences in how they are created and operate compared with GSEs. Congress created Freddie Mac, as it does every GSE, by passing a specific law to bring it into being. Freddie Mac has stockholders and a direct line of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The term, Government Sponsored Enterprise, applies only to a handful of financial entities listed in the federal budget. None of those characteristics apply to credit unions and electric cooperatives. Gingrich was paid by Freddie Mac to provide strategic advice, so he should be familiar with government sponsored entities and know what is and isn’t a GSE. But Gingrich got it wrong twice during the debate in Iowa. We rule his claim Pants on Fire.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-12-19T16:19:06	2011-12-15	['None']
pomt-02664	"Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-minimum-wage-jobs-are-overwhelmi/	Gov. Scott Walker opposes increasing the federal minimum wage, fearing it would prompt employers to do less hiring. In making his case, Walker paints a picture of low-wage workers as people working the counter at fast-food restaurants. "I started out, just like Paul Ryan did down the road from me, working at McDonald's," Walker told Chuck Todd on MSNBC’s "The Daily Rundown" on Jan. 6, 2013. He added: "Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce. The last thing you want to do is have fewer young people (working) at a time when unemployment rates are still way too high for teenagers going into their 20s." Walker’s characterization of the low-wage population touches on a critical element of the debate over raising the national wage, which stands at $7.25 an hour. Just who is making the minimum wage? Neither side can seem to agree on the makeup of those on the bottom end of the earning scale. Is Walker right that "jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce"? His statement is in the context of calls for a higher national minimum wage, so we’ll focus primarily on the national view rather than on individual states, 21 of which have higher minimums than the federal standard. Nationally, 4.7 percent of hourly workers toil for $7.25 an hour or less (It can be less due to various exemptions in labor law, such as for employees who receive tips and others. Plus, many people making the minimum round it down to $7 when responding to the survey). That’s about 3.6 million people 16 or older, based on conservative estimates drawn from the monthly Current Population Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Labor market researchers frequently cite the survey. Of that total, 1.6 million report being right at the federal minimum wage -- 2.1% of the hourly workforce. The BLS includes both groups -- those at the wage mark, and those below it -- in its statistical reports on minimum wage workers. Tips, commissions and overtime pay are not included in the pay data. Salaried workers are not part of the mix. Women, residents of the south, never-married workers, part-timers and service employees are more likely than their counterparts to work for $7.25 or less. Restaurant and other food service workers make up the biggest group. Teenagers overall are more likely than other age groups to work for the minimum, but even in that group nearly 80 percent of the teens earned more than $7.25. Here are the labor bureau’s findings on age: -- "Minimum wage workers tend to be young," the labor bureau said in a February 2013 report that looked at numbers for 2012. "Although workers under age 25 represented only about one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they made up about half of those paid the federal minimum wage or less." --Teenagers (16 to 19) make up about one-quarter (24.1 percent) of hourly paid workers making $7.25 or less, or 31 percent of those right at the minimum wage. Age range of worker Breakdown of workers at minimum or less Breakdown of workers at exactly minimum wage 16 to 19 years old 24.1 percent 30.9 percent 20 to 24 26.5 24.1 25 to 34 20.3 15.5 35 to 44 10.9 9.8 45 to 54 10.4 10.5 55 to 64 5.4 6.4 65 to 69 1.4 1.6 70 and over 1.1 1.2 So how do the facts square with Walker’s comment that "jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce." He refers generally to "young people" and then later refines that to "teenagers" new to the workforce. So let’s look at both. Teenagers, as noted in the chart, make up 24 percent to 31 percent of the low-wage set, depending the measure. That group appears to best fit Walker’s description of "people starting out in the workforce." But some college-age youths are new to the workforce as well, and the labor bureau calls the 16 to 24 group "young" people in its analysis. That 16 to 24 set makes up more than half of hourly federal minimum wage workers -- 51 to 55 percent, again depending on whether you look at those exactly at the wage, or include those below it as well. Walker said the low-wage group is "overwhelmingly" young people, and mentioned teenagers. That strikes us as overstated given that workers older than 24 make up 45 percent to 49 percent of federal minimum wage workers. Teenagers are less than one-third of the overall low-wage group. But there’s no strict numerical definition of "overwhelming", so we asked two experts for their opinion. Mark Calabria, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us that Walker has a numerical point, though describes it incorrectly. "Overwhelming" implies more than a majority, he said. "Disproportionately" was a more apt description, given that such a large share of those low-wage jobs are held by young people who make up a small share of the hourly worker pool, said Calabria, a former senior staffer on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson made the disproportionality argument to back up the governor’s statement. Among other numbers, he highlighted the fact that those 16-24 hold an estimated 55 percent share of jobs right at the federal minimum wage. David Cooper, an economic analyst and minimum wage researcher at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, didn’t dispute the numbers, but said "overwhelmingly" was off the mark. Cooper also argued that the focus on the national minimum wage provided a misleading demographic profile of low-wage workers. Many work for more than $7.25, and therefore are not counted as minimum-wage workers by the labor bureau, but earn the minimums set by their state, he noted. The average age of minimum wage workers goes up under this broader view, said Cooper. EPI supports increasing the national minimum wage. Some Democrats and President Barack Obama are pushing for a $10.10 minimum. Our rating On cable TV’s MSNBC, Walker said "Jobs that involve the minimum wage are overwhelmingly jobs for young people starting out in the workforce." The best estimates are that 24 percent to 55 percent of such jobs are held by teenagers and young adults. That’s a lot, and from a relatively small component of the overall hourly-wage workforce, but his use of "overwhelming" strong suggests that a very large majority of those jobs are held by young people. They are not. We rate his claim False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-01-13T05:00:00	2014-01-06	['None']
pomt-08071	"You can go to Georgia and make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher."	true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/21/martin-kiar/state-rep-kiar-says-teachers-georgia-earn-6000-mor/	No public school teachers in Florida expect to get rich when they start their careers, but could they earn a bigger paycheck if they moved to Georgia? That's what Florida state Rep. Marty Kiar suggested in a Dec. 14, 2010, meeting between South Florida state legislators and Republican Gov.-elect Rick Scott -- a meeting attended by this PolitiFact Florida reporter. Kiar, a Democrat who represents part of South Florida, serves on the PreK-12 appropriations subcommittee. So he should know his facts and figures on public school education. During the meeting where legislators expressed their hopes and concerns for the upcoming year, many talked about public schools. Kiar made a plea to support public schools -- throwing in his criticism of last year's Senate Bill 6, which would have dramatically changed the teacher pay and tenure system and was vetoed by Gov. Charlie Crist. During the campaign, Scott said he favored eliminating tenure for new teachers and expanding school options such as private schools, virtual schools and home schooling. Kiar made a plea to not focus on "punishing teachers," to keep the arts and physical education, and then made a comment about teacher pay: "You can go to Georgia and make about $6,000 more a year as a teacher." That sounds like a hefty chunk of change when talking about a public school teacher's salary. We wanted to know -- is the pay difference that large? And was Kiar talking about starting pay? Average pay? Or perhaps some other measurement? When we spoke to Kiar legislative assistant Scott Barrocas on Dec. 20, 2010, he said that Kiar was on a cruise. Since we could not reach Kiar directly by e-mail or cell phone, we decided the most fair measure of teacher pay and best comparison among states would be statewide average pay. That would reflect salaries for a range of teachers in terms of where they live in the state, experience, degrees held and subject matter. A word of warning: Comparing teacher pay isn't a simple task. Even within the state, there are differences in pay and cost of living among school districts, and paychecks vary widely from small towns to urban centers to affluent beachfront communities. Also benefits vary between states, which makes a difference in take-home pay. And Florida doesn't have a state income tax while many other states -- including Georgia -- do. But Kiar's claim was about salaries, so we are limiting this Truth-O-Meter item to examining that measure. The National Education Association, which describes itself as the nation's largest teachers union, showed that the average teacher pay in Florida was $46,912 compared to $54,274 in Georgia -- or a $7,362 difference during the 2009-10 school year. The chart showed an asterisk next to Georgia because the state's Department of Education did not supply the information in time for the report, said Ed Hurley, who works in research at the National Education Association. The NEA came up with an estimate based on pay in previous years and inflation, Hurley said. Since it's difficult to obtain salary information from DOEs for the current year, Hurley suggested we look back at the NEA's chart for the 2008-09 year on Page 92. That chart showed average teacher pay for Florida was $46,921 and $52,879 for Georgia -- or about $5,958 more for Georgia. We contacted Matt Cardoza, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Education, to ask if he had average teacher pay data for Georgia. Cardoza responded in an e-mail that the average overall teacher salary is $53,138.40 for 2008-09 -- the most recent year of data available for Georgia. We checked the Florida Department of Education for data about average teacher pay across the state. The DOE's Education Information and Accountability Services Data Report on Table 8 showed that the statewide average teacher salary for 2008-09 was $46,938. (Florida's statewide average for 2009-10 decreased slightly to $46,696 but Georgia could not supply that year's data yet and we wanted to compare for the same year.) If we use the data from the Florida and Georgia DOEs, it shows teachers in Georgia earning about $6,200.40 more than in Florida in 2008-09. Note that for the 2008-09 school year the NEA has slightly different figures than the states gave us -- about a $17 difference for Florida and about a $259 difference for Georgia. But the NEA shows nearly $6,000 higher pay in Georgia for 2008-09. The NEA shows more than a $7,000 difference for 2009-10, but the NEA used an estimate for Georgia for that year so it's not as valid of a comparison. Let's summarize all those numbers, with the difference showing how much higher the pay is in Georgia: FL GA Diff NEA 2008-09: $46,921 $52,879 $5,958 NEA 2009-10: $46,912 $54,274* $7,362 DOE 2008-09: $46,938 $53,138.40 $6,200.40 DOE 2009-10: $46,696 N/A N/A * Estimate Still we wondered: Is a straight salary comparison meaningful if we don't compare other factors such as tax policies, health care plans or other criteria? "It's just one factor in the total compensation package," Hurley said. "It is meaningful, but it doesn't tell the whole story on being compensated for their work." Katie Betta, spokesperson for Republican House Speaker Dean Cannon, said in an e-mail that the "bare numbers are not accurate in apples-to-apples comparisons. For example, GA has an income tax, FL does not. FL has class size requirements, meaning many new teachers have been hired, which is not the case in GA. To accurately compare teacher salaries, you must compare among teachers who have been teaching for the same period of time and disaggregate for taxes, health insurance, retirement benefits, etc." She suggested we try the Southern Regional Education Board which sent us a chart of average teacher salaries (click on the "averages for all" tab in the spreadsheet to see the numbers). The most recent year of the chart -- 2008-09 -- showed $46,921 for Florida and $52,879 for Georgia -- the same figures as NEA. The chart states that the sources are NEA and state education agencies. SREB also sent us a 2001 report comparing other benefits such as pensions and health care, but those figures are about a decade old. So are teachers raking in $6,000 more a year in Georgia than Florida? We are using average teacher pay in both states because we found that the best single figure for comparison. By looking at the 2008-09 data from the states' education departments, we find that teachers in Georgia earn about $6,200 more than in Florida. If we look at the most dependable NEA data published, for 2008-09, we find a difference just shy of $6,000. Kiar said "about $6,000," so we rate this claim True.

pomt-07049	Says the 2012-13 state budget "leaves $6 billion in a rainy day fund."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/30/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-lawmakers-balanced-budget-an/	In a recent New Orleans appearance, Texas Gov. Rick Perry recapped legislative action back home balancing the 2012-13 state budget while, he crowed, leaving billions in reserve. Perry told the Republican Leadership Conference on June 18: "To preserve our job-friendly climate, the Texas Legislature didn’t raises taxes this last legislative session while balancing their budget and maintaining essential services. And I might add, that new budget leaves $6 billion in a rainy day fund." Some of what Perry celebrated isn’t at issue. Lawmakers must balance each budget; it’s a state constitutional requirement. Also, the GOP-steered 2011 Legislature never considered a tax increase. Whether the resulting plan maintains essential services is subject to debate; time should tell. For this article, we wondered if Perry’s correct that the budget will ultimately leave $6 billion in the state’s so-called rainy day fund, which has a current balance of $5 billion, according to the state comptroller’s office. The fund is fed by state oil and gas oil production taxes. Some background: In January, state Comptroller Susan Combs predicted the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund, would have a balance of $9.7 billion by the end of August 2013. That figure was later whittled to $6.4 billion after legislators used $3.2 billion to cover a deficit in the current budget that runs through August. But there’s a catch, potentially a biggun. Republican leaders acknowledge the budget signed into law by Perry under-funds the state’s projected share of Medicaid costs by an estimated $4.4 billion. A summary portion of the budget says that’s the amount the state expects the program to need in supplemental state aid in 2013. Also, the new budget includes a kind of IOU by deferring a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts from the end of the 2013 fiscal year to fiscal 2014. In separate interviews, the chairmen of the Senate Finance Committee and House Appropriations Committee agreed that $6.4 billion should accumulate in the fund over the next two years. But, they said, lawmakers will have designs on those dollars when they meet to start writing the next budget in January 2013. "There’s going to be a demand on the" fund, said Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan. "I decided to use it as a backstop." Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, said the $6 billion-plus "is reserved for future spending" because of the estimated Medicaid shortfall and the possibility lawmakers will restore school district payments to their usual schedule. "We kicked the ball down the road," Pitts said. From a fiscal responsibility standpoint, Ogden said, "I feel good.... From a truth-in-budgeting standpoint, we should have gone ahead and committed" money from the fund. Caveat: Pitts and Ogden noted that fiscal expectations could change considerably before legislators confront the next budget. The state’s economy could grow faster than the comptroller projects, Medicaid demands could fall short of the state’s latest forecasts, Congress could even change what it expects states to fund. Of course, the reverse could also happen, ratcheting up the state’s fiscal obligations. So, as Perry says, lawmakers left $6 billion in the fund. However, if projections hold, that money looks likely to be sucked up in 2013 to make up for this year’s legislative decisions to under-fund Medicaid costs and postpone a payment to school districts. Broadly, Perry’s statement leaves the misimpression that Texas state government is sailing along without financial frets. We rate this blue-sky claim Half True.

pomt-04702	Says Mitt Romney’s tax plans would "give an additional $250,000 tax cut to millionaires and billionaires" while raising taxes on the middle class.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/05/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-claims-romney-would-cut-millionaire/	Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who serves as a national co-chairman of President Obama's re-election campaign, recently made a three-day bus tour of Ohio to deliver the message that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are "wrong for the middle class." Criticizing the economic plans of the Republican ticket, Strickland told a crowd in Kent that Romney's tax plans would "give an additional $250,000 tax cut to millionaires and billionaires" while raising taxes on the middle class, according to an account in the Record-Courier of Portage County. Obama made a similar claim in Columbus in May, asserting that Romney wanted "a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country." On the Truth-O-Meter, that claim rated True. PolitiFact Ohio asked the Obama campaign how Strickland's wider claim is supported. In an email, the campaign noted that Strickland also talked about the Ryan budget plan -- the House budget resolution for fiscal 2013 that Ryan proposed -- and said he "was referencing the Romney-Ryan plan, not just Romney." It cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which suggests the plan likely would result in tax cuts for the wealthy, with modest or no benefits for low-income working households. While some Democrats like to refer to Ryan’s plan as the "Romney-Ryan plan," because Romney has endorsed parts of the Ryan budget, there is no hybrid. Romney does have his own tax plan, "and that's the budget plan that we're going to run on," he said on "60 Minutes." According to his campaign website, the plans include permanently extending the 2001-03 tax cuts, further cutting individual income tax rates by 20 percent, broadening the tax base by reducing tax preferences, eliminating taxation of investment income of most individual taxpayers, reducing the corporate income tax, eliminating the estate tax, and repealing the alternative minimum tax and the taxes enacted in 2010’s health reform legislation. Romney’s campaign website states that lowering both individual and corporate tax rates will stimulate economic growth. For an independent assessment of Romney’s plan, we also turned to the Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution, a think tank that, among other things, evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. While judging tax proposals is subject to some degree of interpretation, the Tax Policy Center has a significant degree of respect in tax circles. The group ran two sets of numbers for Romney's plan. One version, known as "current policy," assumes that the tax cuts initially enacted under President George W. Bush and the alternative minimum tax cuts will be extended, with or without Romney. This method only counts the taxpayer savings from the new proposals in Romney’s tax plan. The Tax Policy Center found that under Romney’s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. The other version, known as "current law," essentially gives Romney credit for extending the Bush tax cuts and for an annual adjustment in the alternative minimum tax. Under this calculation, taxpayers’ savings from these two extensions are added to the total tax cuts from Romney’s tax proposal itself. By this method, the average tax cut for someone with cash income north of $1 million a year would be $390,876, according to the Tax Policy Center. Even using the more restrictive of the Tax Policy Center’s two calculations, Strickland's statement about millionaires, like Obama's, is correct. But taxes would not increase on the middle class under the plan, said Bob Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Taxes would decrease for most taxpayers, although they would increase on the bottom quintile, or the poorest 20 percent of the country. Romney has promised that low- and middle-income households will pay no larger shares of federal taxes than they do now. He also said his plan would be revenue neutral, meaning the revenue loss caused by lowering tax rates would be recouped by stimulated economic growth and by reducing or eliminating certain tax deductions and write-offs. But Romney has not specified what tax preferences he would cut to make up lost revenue. The Tax Policy Center looked at some of the possibilities in a second study it published Aug. 1 that analyzed the tradeoffs among the goals stated in Romney's plan, including lowering marginal tax rates, maintaining tax revenues and maintaining progressivity. One of its authors, William Gale, vice president of Brookings and director of its economic studies program, served on President George H.W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. Another, Adam Looney, a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings who has a doctorate from Harvard University, served on Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers in 2009 and 2010. To try and keep with Romney's guiding principles, the authors eliminated deductions and write-offs -- starting with the deductions for top earners first -- until they came up with enough revenue to offset the $360 billion in tax cuts that are part of Romney's plan. They also added in the effects of tax changes on economic growth. using a model developed by one of Romney's economic advisers, Harvard professor Greg Mankiw. They determined that people who earn $1 million or more in taxable income would see an average net tax decrease of $87,117. They’d save $175,961 from Romney's tax cut, but lose $88,444 in deductions. People who earn between $500,000 and $1 million would see a cut of about $17,000, and taxes for people with income between $200,000 and $500,000 would decrease by about $1,800, the study found. But to make Romney's plan revenue neutral, deductions would also have to be removed for people with income below $200,000, and the effects of that would be significant, the study found. Eliminating the deductions would mean outright tax increases for everyone with income below $200,000. People with taxable income between $50,000 and $75,000, for example, would see an average net tax increase of $641. They’d save $984 from Romney's rate cut, but lose $2,672 in write-offs. The authors specifically noted that taxpayers with children whose income is below $200,000 would see their taxes go up by an average of $2,041. The reason for the increase is that the most popular tax breaks heavily benefit middle- and lower-income families -- the 95 percent of the population who earn less than $200,000 and, for example, carry mortgage debt and use employer-provided health insurance. Though Romney has suggested he would focus on taking the deductions away from the wealthy, the study concluded that focusing on the top alone would not make up for the revenue sacrificed when rates are slashed. Unlike John McCain and Obama, whose detailed tax plans were analyzed by the Tax Policy Center in 2008, Romney has presented a "not well defined" plan that is "very explicit about some things and non-specific about others," Williams said. "Given what he has said, it is difficult if not impossible to see a way it would not raise taxes on the middle class." Strickland’s claim was that Romney's plan would "give an additional $250,000 tax cut to millionaires and billionaires" while raising taxes to the middle class. He is partially accurate. A study by the Tax Policy Center about Romney's stated plans found that millionaires would get a $250,000 tax cut. But it also found those plans would cut taxes for the middle class, too, though they would raise them on the lowest-income households. A second Tax Policy Center study, which used what Romney has said about his tax plan and attempted to calculate outcomes for different groups of taxpayers, found that making the plan revenue neutral would result in smaller tax cuts for millionaires and families with income above $200,000, but would require raising taxes on other households, including the middle class. As long as the details of the Romney plan remain unknown, the conclusions can't be definite. But the part of Strickland's statement about millionaires represents tax cuts they would get without accounting for tax deductions and write-offs that could be reduced or eliminated. His statement about the middle class -- who stand to lose more from changes to those deductions than they'd gain by the tax cuts -- includes them. Those are important details that put the claim in proper context. On the Truth-O-Meter, Strickland’s claim rates Half True.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2012-09-05T06:00:00	2012-08-27	['None']
pomt-11918	Says she debated her opponent "multiple times."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/oct/18/nancy-mcfarlane/raleigh-mayor-says-she-debated-opponent-multiple-t/	Charles Francis wants to stand on stage with Raleigh Mayor Nancy McFarlane and debate the best ways to address the city’s issues. Francis on Sunday called for a runoff against McFarlane after the mayor, in municipal elections on Oct. 10, fell about 2 percentage points short of reaching the 50 percent required to secure the win. Francis, who trailed with 36 percent of the vote, says the two candidates have yet to debate. McFarlane, reacting to Francis’ announcement, on Monday challenged the idea that they haven’t debated. "We debated multiple times," McFarlane said. "I’m not sure why he keeps bringing up this narrative that we’ve never debated. We had multiple forums. There were maybe five." How can one candidate say he’s still waiting to debate while another says they’ve debated "multiple times?" Because they appear to have different definitions of the word "debate." Francis, an attorney, says McFarlane has declined his offer to stand on stage with him in a televised event where they argue the issues one-on-one. "Debates are important so that voters can better see the clear alternative that they have in this race," he said in a statement. "Mayor McFarlane has now tentatively agreed to a televised debate during the runoff election. I believe that this debate will point out the clear differences for voters to make an informed decision." McFarlane, a longtime pharmaceutical business owner, considers it a debate if the two candidates are in the same location at the same time explaining their political positions to voters. Her campaign notes that Francis has twice referred to events they attended as debates: in closing comments during the Aug. 15 Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum; and on his Facebook page when he referred to a Sept. 28 forum as a debate. That may be true. But that doesn’t necessarily mean either candidate’s definition of "debate" is accurate. Defining debate Merriam-Webster defines "debate" as "a regulated discussion of a proposition between two matched sides" and Dictionary.com says it’s "a discussion, as of a public question in an assembly, involving opposing viewpoints." By those definitions, McFarlane certainly has a case. Both candidates have been in the same location at the same time answering the same questions. The Commission on Presidential Debates is a nonprofit group that has organized debates for presidential and vice presidential candidates in every general election since 1988. The commission doesn’t offer a definition for a "debate" or list requirements to hold one. Instead, it offers a wide range of formats that can be used in debates and suggests that political debates should be structured and allow for rebuttals. The aforementioned descriptions are so vague that they don’t necessarily help us in this situation. So we asked experts on political science, communication and forensics (which means debate) what they consider to be a true political debate. Key components They all suggested political debates include three elements: a stage, a large audience, and a format that allows for two candidates – and preferably no more – to engage each other in a way that allows for claims and rebuttals. The experts cast doubt on McFarlane’s claim that forums qualify as debates. Forums where candidates answer the same questions could qualify as debates if the candidates are given time to engage each other, said David McLennan, professor of political science at Meredith College in Raleigh. But typically, they don’t. "Unless they’re addressing one another in the same venue, it wouldn’t be a political debate," McLennan said. Allan Louden, chair of the communications department at Wake Forest University, researches argumentation theory, political communication and presidential rhetoric. Louden referred to forums not as debates but as "joint appearances." He says debates are supposed to inform the public about key policy differences between candidates and that, by allowing candidates to challenge each other, face-to-face arguments are the best way to do that. He noted that the size of the audience matters. Debates "are not much good if you don’t have an audience." Robert Imbody, director of forensics at the University of Alabama, said he doesn’t think any of the events qualify as a traditional political debate. He echoed McLennan and Louden in saying there’s got to be "crossfire." "When we talk about what is a debate, we’re talking about an organized clash," Imbody said. "‘If there’s no clash or discord, then there’s nothing to debate. You’re just giving speeches." So let’s look at the events McFarlane and Francis attended together. McFarlane’s campaign says she and Francis attended seven events together between Aug. 15 and Sept. 28. Three stood out to PolitiFact. Raleigh events On Aug. 15, McFarlane and Francis both attended the Raleigh Wake Citizens Association forum at Martin Street Baptist Church. James Sonneman, a spokesman for McFarlane’s campaign, said the mayoral candidates were interviewed separately from council candidates. "During the mayoral portion, only Francis and Nancy participated and were given ample room to engage in a discussion regarding questions posed by community members," Sonneman said. The event was not televised or streamed online. A recording provided by Sonneman includes audio of McFarlane and Francis answering the same questions, one at a time, and occasionally asking the moderator for a chance to respond to the other candidate. In closing comments, Francis said, "I want to thank you all for your attention in the debate tonight." On Sept. 18, Sonneman says they attended a similar event: the Wake County Voter Education Coalition Forum at Garner Rd. Community Center. "As I understand, it had a very similar agenda to the RWCA forum in that Mayoral and Council candidates went separately and that an engaging discussion between Nancy and Francis was fostered," he said. On Sept. 28, Francis and McFarlane attended a forum hosted by the League of Women Voters and WakeUP Wake County Forum at Avent Ferry United Methodist Church. The event, where mayoral and City Council candidates were asked the same questions, was streamed online at wral.com. The video shows McFarlane and Francis often taking turns answering the same question. In Monday’s press conference, McFarlane pointed to the WakeUP event as a debate. Karen Rindge, executive director of WakeUP, said the format allowed for the candidates to engage each other. "They could have raised a point about their opponent if they chose," Rindge said. "However, I would not describe our candidate forum as a structured debate." Our ruling McFarlane said she has debated Francis "multiple times." The candidates were indeed in the same place and exchanged ideas back-to-back. And Francis referred to a couple forums as debates. But political experts say most of the events she’s referring to didn’t include the key elements often needed for a fair, informative political debate. So we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13904	"Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correct-analysts-have-called-donal/	Hillary Clinton, riding a bump in the polls, kept the heat on Donald Trump during a speech in Cincinnati that marked the first time she had campaigned alongside Elizabeth Warren, a favorite of the progressive wing of her party. "Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism," Clinton said during the speech on June 27, 2016. We don’t take a position on whether Trump actually is one of the top threats facing the global economy. But we thought we’d check to see whether Clinton has solid evidence that professional risk analysts have made that argument. So is Clinton right about how analysts have rated Trump? Basically, yes. When we asked the Clinton campaign what she was referring to, they pointed us to the periodic rankings of global risk published by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Economist Intelligence Unit -- an affiliate of The Economist, the London-based newsweekly -- is a research and analysis firm that supplies clients, including businesses, with information about opportunities and risks around the world. The firm made headlines in March 2016 when it listed the possibility of a Trump presidency as one of the biggest threats to "companies’ capacity to operate at target profitability." The rankings are based on "qualitative" judgments of a how powerfully an event could affect the world and how likely it is to happen, the firm says. In its March ratings, the firm rated the risks from a Trump presidency as 12 on a 25-point scale. That ranked Trump sixth among the 10-item list of biggest threats, tied with "the rising threat of jihadi terrorism destabilising the global economy." But the Trump threat level increased in the July 2016 rankings. A Trump presidency now ranks as the third-biggest global threat, with an increased score of 16 on the 25-point scale. In the meantime, the risk from jihadi terrorism has remained constant with a score of 12. In the July ratings, the only higher scores were 20 for "China experiences a hard landing" and, in a tie with Trump, a 16 for "currency volatility and persistent commodity prices weakness." Specifically, the firm wrote that "although we do not expect Mr. Trump to defeat his most likely Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, there are risks to this forecast, especially in the event of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil or a sudden economic downturn." The writeup cited his "hostility" to free trade, his hard line on Muslims, his "militaristic tendencies," his skepticism toward NATO, and his "indifference" to nuclear proliferation in Asia. The firm had never rated a pending candidacy to be a geopolitical risk to the United States and the world, an official told Politico. We checked with Robert Powell, the Economist Intelligence Unit’s New York-based global risk briefing manager, to see whether he thought Clinton’s phrasing was accurate, and he said it was. "Her quote does accurately describe our global risk scenarios," Powell told PolitiFact. "Despite the high likelihood of more terrorist attacks, the impact on the global economy tends to be relatively slight -- indeed, most global stock markets rose on the day of the Brussels attacks, for instance. However, given that the U.S. economy is the biggest in the world, we believe a Trump presidency would have a major impact on the entire global economy." Clinton said "risk analysts" -- plural -- had determined Trump to be a threat, but we were unable to find any equivalent of the Economist Intelligence Unit report. (Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin said that "analysts" was intended to refer to the multiple analysts within the Economist Intelligence Unit who came up with the ratings.) But we did find another major economic report that painted a grim picture of what could happen to the economy if Trump wins. On June 17, Moody’s Analytics, an economic research and data-services firm, published its projections of what could happen to the economy under Trump-backed policies on taxes, government spending, immigration and international trade. (We fact-checked the political background of one of the Moody's authors in another report.) "Four basic conclusions regarding the impact of Mr. Trump’s economic proposals can be reached," the Moody’s team wrote. "One, they will result in a less global U.S. economy; two, they will lead to larger government deficits and more debt; three, they will largely benefit very high-income households; and four, they will result in a weaker U.S. economy, with fewer jobs and higher unemployment." Our ruling Clinton said, "Risk analysts listed Donald Trump, a Donald Trump presidency, as one of the top threats facing the global economy, ahead of terrorism." The analysts at one firm, the Economist Intelligence Unit, have declared the possibility of Trump’s election to be the third-greatest global risk in its current rankings, a risk level that has only grown since the firm began including Trump in its rankings in March. And Clinton has accurately noted that the risk factor given to a Trump presidency is higher than the rating for Islamic terrorism on the firm’s list.

pomt-02481	Chris Christie "helped funnel $6 million in federal Hurricane Sandy money to a senior center in Belleville, N.J., a place that suffered no damage."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/19/lawrence-odonnell/lawrence-odonnell-says-chris-christie-steered-6-mi/	MSNBC anchors continued their exhaustive coverage of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s no-good 2014 recently with a look at how he went to bat for new senior housing in a small town. What’s so bad about that? O'Donnell suggested that Christie wasted Superstorm Standy relief money to help fund the project. On his Feb. 11 show, O’Donnell opened with clips of Christie speaking to the Economic Club of Chicago, where Christie said he fought for Superstorm Sandy relief money "because every dollar that we’ve been shorted will have an impact on the lives of the people of my state. And as governor, your job is to fight for those people as hard as you can." That’s when O’Donnell chimed in: "Now, of course, Christie knows that he’s talking to an audience that knows nothing about what he’s talking about. That is his specialty as a public speaker. ... He was talking to an audience that did not know that he helped funnel $6 million in federal Hurricane Sandy money to a senior center in Belleville, N.J., a place that suffered no damage." PunditFact wanted to dig deeper into O’Donnell’s assertion. Where did O’Donnell come up with that? The claim is grounded, for the most part, in a Jan. 28 investigation by The Star-Ledger newspaper of Newark, N.J. The crux of the report: Christie personally pushed for hurricane relief money to build a senior housing project that had been in the works long before Superstorm Sandy in Belleville, a town in Essex County. Belleville was "not particularly hard hit," the newspaper reported, with some flooding, downed trees and some week-long power outages. But Essex County was one of nine counties deemed most impacted by the storm by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. As part of $1.8 billion in various federal disaster relief grants, Christie directed $6 million to the senior housing project. Christie played a prominent role during a May 2013 groundbreaking ceremony for the new housing complex, which will cost $18 million overall (the day after he famously traversed the Jersey Shore with President Barack Obama). Town mayor Raymond Kimble praised Christie for committing to the facility’s construction, saying it will help seniors stay in their hometown instead of spending their final years somewhere new. (Here’s a video.) Christie echoed those remarks as he described how he kept in constant contact with various state and local officials about the project (video): "This project was so worthy, and to be honest, so overdue that I felt like there was no time to wait. We needed to do this and do it quickly," Christie said. Two weeks later, Kimble, a Democrat, endorsed Christie as the governor faced re-election. The coverage from that day, and the speeches, included little mention of a connection to Superstorm Sandy, or that the housing was needed as part of the storm response. What was the damage? It’s too far to say Belleville suffered "no damage." Most if not all of New Jersey felt something, even if it wasn’t as severely pummeled as the Jersey Shore. All 21 counties were declared major disaster areas. A Rutgers University study found that Belleville ranked 255th out of 553 municipalities in what researchers called the Sandy Community Hardship Index. The index measures the residential, commercial and municipal damage to each New Jersey town -- with No. 1 being the hardest hit. Kimble, Belleville’s mayor, told the Star-Ledger he did not know of any residents who were displaced by the storm, and experts told us there are no good numbers for displaced residents for the state overall. About 3 percent of Belleville’s households, or 43, had major or severe damage from the storm, whereas anywhere from 10 to 113 percent of households in various parts of Toms River, N.J., suffered major or severe damage, according to New Jersey’s action plan for a Community Development Block Grant for disaster relief. The Star-Ledger more recently published another investigation into Sandy spending, this time finding nearly one-third of the $160 million pot designated for new affordable housing projects after the storm went to Essex and Middlesex counties, which were not as affected as coastal communities. There’s more to the story, says Team Christie Let’s review the facts that aren’t up for disagreement: The senior facility is slated for $6 million in Sandy relief funds, and Christie made sure the senior center got the money. There is also little debate that Belleview did not suffer the brunt of the storm, though describing it as "no damage" as O’Donnell did is an overstatement. What Christie’s team disputes is the suggestion that the Belleview senior housing project is not connected to Superstorm Sandy. Christie’s press office, both in the Star-Ledger story and in an email to PunditFact, said the 137-unit housing project served a need for affordable rental housing for people displaced by the storm. A group of about 35 housing projects approved for disaster grant funding, including the Belleville facility, "were awarded objectively and helped expand affordable housing in Sandy-affected counties to give impacted renters permanent housing options as close to their homes as possible," said spokesman Colin Reed. Put more simply, Reed said the project will serve a need of people in Essex County and elsewhere who were affected by the storm. An executive at the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency has told reporters the goal was to choose "shovel-ready projects." But neither Christie nor other local officeholders at the groundbreaking mentioned that purpose (though a county press release did include a passing mention about housing essentially being available to Sandy survivors). Instead, the officials talked about how the project will allow Belleville seniors to stay in Belleville. "Seniors shouldn’t have to leave the place where they raised their family to find affordable housing," Christie said. Adam Gordon, a staff attorney for the New Jersey-based Fair Share Housing Center, said the idea that residents from harder-hit areas would uproot their lives and move into a Belleville senior housing complex about an hour away from coastal communities is not really credible. "You shouldn’t be able to use ‘shovel ready’ as an excuse for things that are not located in, or really near, the areas that are hit the hardest," Goodman said, "or places that are basically saying ‘we’re marketing this to seniors in our town.’ " We could not reach a spokesman for O’Donnell’s show. Our ruling O’Donnell said Chris Christie "helped funnel $6 million in federal Hurricane Sandy money to a senior center in Belleville, N.J., a place that suffered no damage." O’Donnell is right that Christie helped steer $6 million in Sandy money to a senior center. And he’s right that Belleville fared much better than other places in New Jersey, though to say "no damage" is an exaggeration. Because of that caveat, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02746	"By the word religion in the First Amendment, the founders meant Christianity."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/16/bryan-fischer/fundamentalist-when-founders-said-religion-they-me/	Correction: Thomas Jefferson wrote about religious tolerance in the context of a proposed Virigina law. An earlier version offered a different context. This item was updated at 4:40 p.m. Dec. 16, 2013, to reflect that change. There’s nothing like the holidays to bring out the fault lines at the intersection of religion and the state. The New York-based Satanic Temple stirred things up in Oklahoma when it announced that it was submitting plans for a statehouse monument that speaks to its beliefs. This comes several years after Oklahoma lawmakers granted permission for a private group to put up a 10 commandments monument on the capitol lawn. The Satanists say if lawmakers are okay with the 10 commandments, they have to accept all religious representations. Christian fundamentalist talk show host Bryan Fischer said Satanism enjoys no such protection. "By the word religion in the First Amendment, the founders meant Christianity," Fischer said on an American Family Radio broadcast. We thought we’d go to the historic record to see if that claim hews closely to the facts. Fischer said in the second half of the 18th century, the overwhelming majority of the people were Christians. Jews accounted for less than 1 percent, Fischer estimated. The founders, he said, lived in a particular religion environment. "They weren’t providing any cover or shelter for the free exercise of Islam or even Judaism or even atheism," he said. "They weren’t prohibiting that. They were just saying, that is not what we are talking about here." Fischer told PunditFact that he relied on the 1833 writings of U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Joseph Story. President James Madison nominated Story to the court in 1811. Story had a narrow view of the First Amendment. "The real object of the amendment was, not to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity," Story wrote, "but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects." At least some of the actual founders voiced contrary views. Thomas Kidd, professor of history at Baylor University and the author of God of Liberty: A Religious History of the American Revolution, said "the founders were certainly aware of other religions besides Christianity, and discussed them at length in their writings." Kidd pointed us to a 1818 letter from John Adams: "This country has done much. I wish it would do more; and annul every narrow idea in religion, government and commerce," Adams wrote. "It has pleased the providence of the first cause, the universal cause, that Abraham should give religion not only to Hebrews, but to Christians and Mohomitans, the greatest part of the modern civilized world." Benjamin Franklin also weighed in on the subject. Jan Ellen Lewis, professor of history at Rutgers University, cited Franklin’s autobiography, when he praised a new meeting house built in Philadephia. "The design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in general," Franklin wrote. "So that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service." In his autobiography, Thomas Jefferson spoke directly to the debate over the crafting of a Virginia statute for religious freedom. Jefferson describes a proposal to add the phrase "the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion." "The insertion was rejected by a great majority," Jefferson wrote, "In proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and Infidel of every denomination." John Ragosta, the Robert C. Vaughan Fellow at the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, pointed us to that excerpt. Ragosta did not dispute that the great majority of people in America were Christians, but he said that makes the vision of the founders that much more impressive. "They were looking to the future," Ragosta said. "They knew that other people would come to America … and that the rights that they were discussing were universal." The historians we reached acknowledged that not every founder shared these beliefs. Still, those contrary views did not carry the day. Fischer also stated that the First Amendment did not apply to the states. Our experts agreed that originally, the states enjoyed the power to foster a particular religion. "Massachusetts retained their state church until 1833," Kidd said. "Various states banned non-Christians from holding state office." But over time Ragosta said, many states themselves overturned such laws, before the Supreme Court declared them unconstitutional in 1961. Our ruling Fischer said that when the founders used the word "religion" in the First Amendment, they meant Christianity. Fischer cites one Supreme Court justice who expressed that view in 1833. On the other side, we have the writings of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and the opinions of scholars. We were unable to find much merit to this claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-13621	Says Donald Trump "has been talking about the option of using a nuclear weapon against our Western European allies."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton/has-donald-trump-talked-about-using-nukes-against-/	Donald Trump is "too dangerous" to have access to the nuclear codes, Hillary Clinton emphasizes in a new ad. The ad features soundbites from pundits voicing concern about whether Trump is ready for the responsibilities of the presidency. Speakers include Michael Hayden, former CIA director under George W. Bush; Max Boot, a conservative foreign policy analyst; and Charles Krauthammer, a conservative columnist. (All have criticized Trump on some occasions.) One clip features Gillian Turner, who worked at the White House National Security Council under George W. Bush and Barack Obama, talking on Fox News. Trump "has been talking about the option of using a nuclear weapon against our Western European allies," the ad shows Turner saying. We wanted to fact-check whether the Clinton campaign accurately portrayed Trump’s comments about nuclear weapons and western Europe. In our view, even though Turner made the statement, it was the Clinton campaign’s decision to pull the clip and advance its "unfit" argument. Is Clinton’s campaign correct in saying Trump has considered using nuclear weapons against America’s western European allies? Not exactly. What Trump has said The comment in question stems from an MSNBC town hall interview in March. Trump was asked by host Chris Matthews if he might use nuclear weapons. Trump: "I’d be the last one to use the nuclear weapons, because that’s sort of like the end of the ballgame." Matthews: "So, can you take it off the table now? Can you tell the Middle East we are not using the nuclear weapon on anybody?" Trump: "I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table." Matthews: "How about Europe? We won’t use it in Europe." Trump: "I’m not going to take it off the table for anybody." Matthews: "You might use it in Europe?" Trump: "No. I don’t think so, but — I am not taking cards off the table. I’m not going to use nukes, but I’m not taking cards off the table." In the same breath, Trump said he would not use nuclear weapons, but he went on to say he wouldn't take it off the table for "anybody," include Europe. He stuck by this phrasing in another interview on The O’Reilly Factor when Eric Bolling asked the same question. "Europe’s a big place," he said. "I’m not going to take cards off the the table. We have nuclear capability. Now, our capability is going down rapidly because of what we're doing. It's in bad shape. The equipment is not properly maintained. There are all lot of talk about that. And that's a bad thing, not a good thing.The last person to use nuclear would be Donald Trump. That’s the way I feel. I think it’s a horrible thing. The thought of it is horrible, but I don’t want to take anything off the table." In these two interviews, each held within a day of one another, Trump’s position on nuclear weapons overall and in Europe is convoluted. Yes, he hates the idea, but he doesn’t want to take the option off the table. Experts weigh in Experts we spoke to said Trump’s comments were a departure from previous rhetoric because they’re imprecise, but they noted his refusal to "take options off the table" is vaguely in line with U.S. policy. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referred to the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report, which focuses on preventing nuclear proliferation, "Indeed, as long as nuclear weapons exist, the United States will sustain safe, secure, and effective nuclear forces," reads the report. "These nuclear forces will continue to play an essential role in deterring potential adversaries and reassuring allies and partners around the world." Point being, there are some instances where the United States does not rule out using nuclear weapons, he said, which is why Trump’s "cards on the table" policy is somewhat in line with U.S. policy. Jim Walsh, an international security and research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he’s "seen nothing" suggesting Trump would use nuclear weapons against America’s European allies. "What Trump may be trying to say is actually consistent with traditional U.S. doctrine, that is, we are prepared to use (nuclear weapons) to counter a Russian/Soviet invasion of Western Europe with conventional forces," Walsh, who is not a fan of Trump, said. "That's a NATO commitment." The usual rhetoric -- that America would use nuclear weapons against Soviets to protect our allies -- is in line with what previous presidents have said, said Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University. It should be noted that Nephew said he is "repelled by Trump and his rhetoric, including around nuclear weapons." "Previous presidents have spoken about the use of nuclear weapons to threaten the Soviets and others that might attack our allies," Nephew said. "They have talked about battlefield uses only in an extreme crisis and rarely spoken about tactical nuclear weapons at all (which would be what a normal president would be referring to: using nuclear weapons to attack enemy forces invading our Allies)." After speaking to experts, we can conclude that Trump’s comments are vague, but do not translate directly into using weapons against our European allies. We reached out to Gillian Turner to hear how she feels about being used in the ad, but we didn’t hear back from her. Our ruling A Clinton campaign ad claims Trump has talked about the option of using nuclear weapons against America’s western European allies. Experts said his comments on nuclear weapons are imprecise, but they interpreted his comments as vaguely aligned with U.S. policy, at least in the sense that America does not rule out using weapons to protect allies. Trump never explicitly talked about using nuclear weapons against America’s allies in Europe -- but that he he is just leaving the option open. The claim has an element of truth but is misleading, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6046bf15-c408-418b-a780-1b5220f04bca	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-08-12T09:53:28	2016-08-02	['None']
pomt-12934	Of Sen. Jeff Sessions, "you've objected to immigrants volunteering to serve in our armed forces, saying, 'In terms of who's going to be most likely to be a spy, somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?'"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/10/richard-durbin/durbin-says-sessions-objected-immigrants-armed-for/	Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., challenged fellow senator and nominee for U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, over his lack of support for bills that would’ve helped immigrants in the country illegally during Sessions’ first confirmation hearing. "Sen. Sessions, since joining the Senate in 1997, you've voted against every immigration bill that included a path to citizenship for the undocumented," Durbin said during the hearing Jan. 10. "You described the DREAM Act, which I introduced 15 years ago to spare children who are undocumented through no fault of their own, as 'a reckless proposal for mass amnesty.' You opposed the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill, which passed the Senate four years ago." Durbin then spotlighted Sessions’ comments about immigrants in the military. "You've objected to immigrants volunteering to serve in our armed forces, saying, 'In terms of who's going to be most likely to be a spy, somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?'," Durbin said. We wanted to know if that was Sessions’ position. Durbin was referring to a 2014 radio interview on the Lars Larson Show, a conservative talk radio program. Durbin quoted Sessions accurately, but it’s not clear from the quote he plucked that the discussion was about immigrants in the country illegally, not all immigrants. The Lars Larson Show On the show, Sessions raised concerns about "immigration-type language" being added to a defense authorization bill. Host Larson asked him about that language: "Sen. Sessions, the essence of the idea is, we would say, if you are here in the United States illegally, if you go join the military and do some service, then we will give you permanent resident status to stay in the United States." Sessions agreed on that assessment, but he said, "The real issue would be to open it up to adding additional language." The Alabama senator told Larson he had heard talks of reducing the Army by 100,000 or more soldiers, and that he didn’t think it was the right thing to do. Sessions brought up a news story about a "native of Kenya" who had been accused of demanding $50,000 from a local family to protect them from a hitman. The man was serving in the Navy and Sessions questioned how he had been able to get in. (The Kenyan man was found not guilty of the extortion charge in 2015.) "So, I’m wondering could you get a good test score from his high school, could you get good grade point average from Kenya or wherever," Sessions said. "I just think in terms of who’s going to be the most likely to be a spy: somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?" Sessions added: "We’re going in the wrong direction in a lot of ways. Our head isn’t thinking clearly. At a time when this country needs a good military, the last thing we need to be doing is turning out of our military of people who served and then bringing in people who are illegally in the country." Sessions is initially asked about legislation that would allow "Dreamers" to serve, said Durbin spokesman Ben Marter, "but then speaks at length about immigrants serving in the military and when he says this, he does not distinguish between legal and undocumented immigrants." In the Senate confirmation hearing, Sessions didn’t directly address Durbin’s claim about him objecting to immigrants volunteering to serve in the armed forces. A spokeswoman for Sessions said the Republican senator "has no problem" with eligible immigrants serving in the military "and as attorney general he will enforce and defend such laws as well." "Generally speaking, illegal aliens are not eligible to serve in the military. But regardless, the decision of whether to allow illegal aliens to serve in the military is up to Congress and not something that the attorney general controls," said spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. The secretary of defense has authorized immigrants approved for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to be considered for enlistment in the armed forces. Our ruling During Sessions’ Senate confirmation for attorney general, Durbin told him, "You've objected to immigrants volunteering to serve in our armed forces, saying, 'In terms of who's going to be most likely to be a spy, somebody from Cullman, Ala., or somebody from Kenya?'" In a 2014 radio interview, Sessions discusses immigrants in the military and raises concerns about a man from Kenya serving in the military, after allegations of the man trying to extort a local family. Sessions does question who’s more likely to be a spy -- somebody from Alabama or Kenya. The radio conversation includes comments about a subset of immigrants, people in the country illegally. With military reductions on the table, Sessions said "the last thing we need" is to get rid of people who have served in the military and bring in "people who are illegally in the country." Durbin’s statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-11190	Says Gwen Graham "voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/may/17/collective-super-pac/did-gwen-graham-vote-against-president-obama-52-pe/	A progressive super PAC slammed the congressional record of Democrat Gwen Graham as too conservative for Florida’s next governor. The Collective super PAC paid for the 30-second spot. The group supports black, progressive candidates and is backing Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in the Florida Democratic primary. The ad portrays Graham, who served one term in the House representing North Florida’s District 2, as a contrarian to former President Barack Obama. "Gwen Graham says she is the progressive candidate for governor," the voiceover says, "but while in Congress she voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time." We wanted to know if about half of Graham’s votes really went against what the Obama White House wanted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We found the claim slightly overstates Graham’s votes against Obama by focusing only on part of her time in Congress, rather than both years of her term. Graham’s breaks with the White House were on issues of national security, foreign policy and energy. Sometimes, she was one of just a handful of Democrats to do so. Graham voted more reliably liberal on health care and abortion. Still, according to VoteView.com’s analysis of every roll call vote, Graham was "more conservative than 91 percent of Democrats in the House at the time." Understanding the division The breakdown comes from an analysis by Congressional Quarterly, which tracked how members of Congress voted when the president took a clear position. That includes statements of administration policy provided in advance of the vote, as well as statements by the president or his designated spokespersons. CQ offered a percentage for votes in both 2015 and 2016. In 2015, CQ counted 89 House votes where the White House had a stated preference. According to CQ, Graham supported the president on 49 percent of those votes in 2015. In other words, she voted against Obama 51 percent of the time. One of the most controversial pieces of legislation that Graham voted for in 2015 was a Republican bill that authorized the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline (HR 3). Twenty-eight Democrats including Graham voted in favor of authorizing the pipeline’s construction, which also passed the Senate. But Obama vetoed the bill. More examples: • Graham voted for the Republican-backed North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act (HR 8), which supporters said would have helped modernize infrastructure and federal policies. But the Obama White House threatened to veto the bill because "it would undermine already successful initiatives designed to modernize the nation's energy infrastructure and increase our energy efficiency." It did not make it to a vote in the Senate, however. • Graham voted in favor of legislation (HR 37) that would have amended the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Obama had signed Dodd-Frank into law in 2010. The bill did not pass the Senate. In 2016, however, the percentage of Graham’s votes with Obama increased. Of 54 votes, CQ found Graham voted in line with the White House 65 percent of the time. Or, she broke with Obama on 35 percent of those votes. Some examples: • Graham was one of only three Democrats to vote for the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, which would have increased congressional oversight of sanctions against Iran. It passed the House but did not come to a vote in the Senate, but Obama had threatened to veto the bill. • Graham joined 11 Democrats in voting for a GOP-backed bill that would have prohibited the transfer of a Guantanamo Bay detainee to a facility in the United States. • Graham also voted for the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act, which would have placed significant hurdles on the processing of some refugees, likely resulting in at least a pause in admissions. The Obama White House said the bill would in effect prevent Syrian immigrants from coming to the United States by adding significant new certification requirements. Graham camp objects Graham spokesman Matt Harringer said the claim doesn’t tell the whole story. "Gwen disagreed from time to time with President Obama, like on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but she is proud of her progressive record and overwhelmingly voting to support President Obama's agenda — including voting eight times to save the Affordable Care Act, to defend the Clean Power Plan and to protect the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau," he said. Graham voted multiple times against Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act while in Congress. The White House only weighed in on half of those votes, despite the fact that Obama would have likely opposed the measures. Harringer pointed to CQ’s party-unity scores, which are included on the same study as the presidential positions. Graham’s average party-unity score was 84 percent after two years in Congress. He also pushed back on VoteView.com’s characterization of her as a "conservative" Democrat. "You could just as easily say she was the most bipartisan Democrat in the Florida delegation at the time," Harringer said. Our ruling The Collective super PAC said Graham "voted against President Obama 52 percent of the time." In her two years in the House, Graham stood out as a Democrat who did not always vote the party line, siding with conservatives on some significant measures about foreign policy and defense. But the group’s ad overstates the percentage in which Graham voted against what Obama wanted by only looking at part of her time in Congress. Graham voted against Obama’s stated policy preference around half the time in 2015, but only 35 percent of the time in 2016. On average for those 143 votes, she broke with Obama 45 percent over two years. Because the claim is partially accurate but missing some details, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02124	"Explosive growth in Medicare" is the reason federal deficit spending is predicted to top $1 trillion again after falling to $600 billion annually.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/11/sean-duffy/sean-duffy-says-explosive-growth-medicare-will-cau/	At the state Republican Party’s convention, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy’s mind was on Medicare. The Republican from northern Wisconsin said unchecked spending on the federal health insurance program for seniors and disabled Americans could reverse progress on taming federal budget deficits and debt. "The debt, it has come down," Duffy said in an interview at the convention with Wisconsin Eye reporter Steve Walters. "We topped out at $1.5 trillion in deficit spending … and we’re down to a bit over $600 billion (deficit). If you look out two years it actually launches again. Then we’re over $1 trillion in just a few more years. So this is not over." Duffy added: "The reason is you have an explosive growth with Medicare. Because our baby boomers are retiring, and -- it’s a great thing with modern medicine -- we live longer as people, and health care costs are going up. All that is putting pressure on Medicare." The congressman’s remarks were made to bolster his case for reforms -- opposed by Democrats -- that he says could save Medicare from insolvency. We’re aware that Duffy backed U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s 2015 budget, which endorsed changes in Medicare for the next generation of recipients. But we wondered whether "explosive growth in Medicare" is the biggest reason projections show the federal deficit topping $1 trillion again after falling to $600 billion annually. By the numbers Duffy’s office offered no backup for his claim, but the numbers are readily available. The annual budget deficit for the 2013 fiscal year was $680 billion, according to an April 2014 report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan scorekeeper. That’s down from $1.41 trillion in 2009, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget’s website. But projections are that after dipping to $469 billion in 2015, yearly deficits will rise steadily to $998 billion by 2022 and slightly over $1 trillion the next two years. (As a percentage of U.S. Gross Domestic Product, the deficit rises from 2.8 percent to 3.7 percent from 2014 to 2024). Why the roller coaster ride? There’s no disagreement that Medicare costs, though growing more slowly than historical rates, will rise substantially in the coming decade as growing numbers of baby boomers become eligible for benefits at age 65. "Under current law, spending for Medicare is expected to grow by an average of 6 percent per year over the next 10 years," a CBO report in February said. "That growth can be attributed in roughly equal parts to increasing caseloads and rising costs per beneficiary." But is Medicare growth "explosive?" And how big a driver will it be in future deficits? For more than a decade, policy analysts have warned of the long-term consequences of rising health care spending. But it’s been widely reported that recent growth in Medicare’s per-beneficiary costs has slowed as overall health-care cost inflation has slowed. In fact, the CBO noted that, over most of the next 10 years, spending for Social Security and Medicare remains "fairly stable" as a share of GDP, before rising in the final few years of the 10-year projection period. Still, Medicare costs are projected to rise faster than GDP growth in the future, said Melinda Buntin, chair of the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. And the government’s crystal ball reveals some eye-popping numbers on Medicare’s future. In 2013, Medicare had about 51 million beneficiaries; that number is expected to climb to 71 million in 2024, the February CBO report said. But other major forces not cited by Duffy will drive deficits. Rising interest rates and increasing federal debt are expected to raise net interest payments from $227 billion in 2014 to $876 billion in 2024. Another player in "healthcare costs" is Medicaid, the federal health program for low-income people. It will account for 2.1 percent of the economy in 2024, up from 1.7 percent in 2014, as some states expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And Social Security is rising fast as well, Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us. The CBO summed up the landscape by saying the substantial rise in the deficit will be mainly because of the aging population, rising healthcare costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance (in the Affordable Care Act), and growing interest payments on federal debt. So, bottom line, what is the main driver in the deficit projections? For help, we turned to the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that educates the public about the consequences of federal budget decisions. Concord’s policy director, Joshua Gordon, said that, on a percentage growth basis, Medicare and Social Security are in a virtual tie between now and the $1 trillion projected deficit in 2022. Their predicted growth rates in that period are within a percentage point. Still, Social Security, the largest federal entitlement, contributes more to the deficit in actual dollar terms. Social Security is projected to grow by nearly $500 billion over 10 years compared with about $310 billion for net Medicare outlays (after factoring in premiums paid and other offsets). Net interest on federal debt easily tops both of those -- though Joseph Antos, a health care scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, notes that "net interest is the result of decades of deficit spending and is not something one can reduce directly." Cutting Social Security involves directly reducing benefits. That leaves Medicare. Congress and the White House have enacted several Medicare savings items, but have been unable to reach a long-term deal to tame Medicare and Social Security growth. They have concentrated spending cuts on discretionary programs, things such as defense, law enforcement, transportation, the national park system, disaster relief, and foreign aid. As a consequence, both defense and nondefense discretionary outlays are projected to fall by more than 20 percent relative to the size of the economy over the next 10 years, CBO said. PolitiFact Florida in November 2013 checked Senator Marco Rubio’s claim that "what is driving our long-term debt are Medicare and Social Security programs that are structured in unsustainable ways." Rubio’s claim was rated Mostly True. Medicare and Social Security are projected to grow as a percentage of GDP, while defense is projected to shrink by the same measurement -- but defense is a factor in our debt, the item said. Our rating Duffy says "explosive growth in Medicare" is the reason that federal deficit spending is predicted to top $1 trillion again after falling to $600 billion annually. The congressman’s deficit figures are on target and there’s no doubt that Medicare is a major driver of predicted deficits. But Duffy leaves out Social Security from the equation. There’s a spot on the Truth-O-Meter for a partially accurate statement that leaves out important details. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-00816	Says Barack Obama voted for the "very same language" of Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act when he was in the Illinois state Senate. Sexual orientation "doesn't have anything to do with this law."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/29/mike-pence/did-barack-obama-vote-religious-freedom-restoratio/	Indiana Gov. Mike Pence decried an "avalanche of intolerance" directed at his state Sunday after he signed a law that he says protects the religious freedom of Hoosiers. Critics, however, say it is Pence and Republican lawmakers who are promoting intolerance, with civil rights advocates and business leaders of Apple and Indiana-based organizations such as the NCAA and Angie’s List wary of the state’s new Religious Freedom Restoration Act opening the door for discrimination against gays and lesbians based on religious belief. That fear is overblown, Pence said on ABC This Week on March 29, 2015, pointing to support for similar legislation from two of the country’s highest-profile Democrats as evidence: President Bill Clinton, who signed the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993, and President Barack Obama. Sexual orientation "doesn’t have anything to do with" the law, Pence said. "Then state-Sen. Barack Obama voted for (the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) when he was in the state senate of Illinois," Pence said. "The very same language." While Pence would not answer if Indiana businesses could refuse to serve gay couples, he repeated his point about Obama a few times. So we wanted to fact-check it. The bottom line: As an Illinois state senator, Obama did vote for a version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It passed the Illinois Senate 56-0 and became law on July 1, 1998. However, the language isn’t the "very same," and the claim is not as simple as lining up one vote next to the other and declaring them equal, experts told us. Then and now The 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act was signed by Clinton with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill passed the House unanimously and 97-3 in the Senate. The intent of the bill was to protect religious practices from government interference, such as whether a Muslim prison guard could wear a beard, or if a Jehovah’s Witness needed special coverage for medical procedures because he or she is against blood transfusions, or Native American religious practices. States started passing their own laws when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1997 that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed did not apply to the states. Since then, 19 states have passed their own laws. Many, like Illinois, did so in the initial wave. Fast-forward to the current climate. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans. Meanwhile, same-sex marriage bans in states like Indiana have been struck down by lower courts, dramatically changing the concept of legal marriage at breakneck speed. Conservatives in Indiana and elsewhere see the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2015, lawmakers in 16 states have introduced legislation that proposes or changes laws protecting religious liberty. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a similar but more widely opposed law in 2014. When Pence signed SB 101 in a private ceremony, three people who work for groups that supported the same-sex marriage ban and want to limit civil rights for gays and lesbians were in attendance. One of the lobbyists, Eric Miller of Advance America, heralded the state’s law as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty "for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples." This is a direct reference to high-profile cases of Christian wedding vendors refusing to provide services for gay couples in other states. In his ABC interview, Pence said Indiana’s law followed the Hobby Lobby case before the Supreme Court last year, in which the court ruled 5-4 that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects family owned corporations from being forced to offer insurance that covers contraception under the health care law. In one sense, there isn’t all that much difference between the bill that got Obama’s vote in Illinois 17 years ago and the bill that Pence signed into law last week. But how people want the law applied, on top of other legislative changes, has changed the landscape dramatically, said Steve Sanders, Indiana University Maurer School of Law professor of family and constitutional law. "What has completely changed are the politics around the issue, the symbolism of what voting for one of these laws means," Sanders said. In other words, it’s how some conservatives want Indiana’s law to work that fosters fear among civil rights advocates for how it might. Still, constitutional law professors say both sides are misinterpreting the point of these laws. The courts have not approved exemptions to discriminate against gays under religious freedom laws, and likely would not because the government has a compelling interest in protecting civil rights. The two sides are essentially yelling past one another about a non-issue when they should be working on enacting protections based on sexual orientation in Indiana, said Robin Fretwell Wilson, professor and director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois College of Law. "If there’s a license to discriminate in Indiana, it’s the fact there’s an absence of a statewide law that makes a promise to the LGBT community," she said. "RFRA is about minoritarian religion against government, by and large." LGBT protections Indiana and Illinois are neighbors in geography but strangers in their approach to gay rights. This difference adds another layer of context to consider with Pence’s claim. In 2004, Illinois lawmakers passed anti-discrimination laws based on sexual orientation for housing, employment, public accommodation, credit and other measures. Nine years later, the state passed a same-sex marriage law. These protections did not exist in the state when Obama cast his vote, but same-sex marriage was not part of the discussion as it is now, as it was not yet legalized, Wilson said. Pressed by Stephanopoulos, Pence said he would not seek protections based on sexual orientation in Indiana and would not say whether Hoosiers could refuse services to gays or lesbians. "To say, ‘We did what Illinois did,’ without acknowledging the fact that Illinois gave protections, really misses the real debate," Wilson said. An Indianapolis Star exploration of what the law means for the state suggested LGBT rights may succeed in RFRA challenges in the few cities that have passed nondiscrimination ordinances. But whether the state as a whole has a "compelling interest" in protecting LGBT rights over religious beliefs remains to be seen, the report said. Lambda Legal, a nonprofit that fights for gay rights, said Indiana’s lack of protections for gays and lesbians is important because people who do not want to take business from gays and lesbians "may claim that lack of a statewide law barring sexual orientation and gender identity discriminating means that there is no compelling state interest in enforcing local ordinances providing such protections." Sanders of Indiana University said the problem is that people in Indiana might think they can discriminate against gays and lesbians now even if a court does not eventually side with them. "The fine print is that if someone wants to discriminate, they have to be able to argue in court for that right, and the court will eventually decide," Sanders said. Difference in wording The wording of each state’s law is similar in that neither mentions sexual orientation or discrimination. But the Human Rights Campaign, which opposes Indiana’s law, says the law is fundamentally different than the federal version and Illinois’ over its definition of "person." Under Indiana’s post-Hobby Lobby law, a "person" is extended to mean "a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association" or another entity driven by religious belief that can sue and be sued. To the Human Rights Campaign, this nullifies Pence’s claim that his law is nothing new from the Illinois law. "That means a corporation in Indiana has a cause of action to sue the government claiming religious personhood for the purposes of this law," said HRC spokesman Adam Talbot. To Wilson, the inclusion of a corporation is not surprising. It was not typical to define "person" in religious freedom legislation, she said, which gets to the heart of the Hobby Lobby case. The Supreme Court decided laws could be applied to "closely held" companies operating on religious belief. Further, all three laws contain the "same critical language" that if someone feels substantially burdened by a regulation or law, the government has to justify a "compelling government interest" for it to the court, said Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia constitutional law professor (Laycock and Wilson co-signed a letter to Indiana Senate Republicans in support of SB 101 not because its effects will be "radical" but but because it offered "more transparent and more secure" protections of religious liberty.) The Illinois law does not address the "person" question because it mirrors the federal law, which was interpreted to apply to corporations because the U.S. Code includes "corporations" as a person, Laycock said. "As a practical matter, there are almost no cases involving corporations because very few are running on religious lines," Laycock said. The American Civil Liberties Union, meanwhile, is concerned about another difference in the wording of the two laws. Indiana’s law includes language that allows people to claim a religious freedom exemption "regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding." That language is absent from the Illinois law. "The Illinois law was written and designed to allow someone to change the government’s burdens on people’s religious beliefs," said Eunice Rho, American Civil Liberties Union advocacy and policy counsel. "The Indiana law specifically says you can use the law in a lawsuit even if the government isn’t a party." Ultimately, judges will have to interpret the intent of the Indiana law’s language. But that doesn’t change that there are differences between it and the counterpart in Illinois. Our ruling Pence played defense Sunday, saying, that sexual orientation "doesn’t have anything to do with" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act," adding that "then state-Sen Barack Obama voted for (the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) when he was in the state Senate of Illinois. The very same language." A spokeswoman for Pence did not respond. The vote is clear enough, as is the name of the bill, but Pence’s explanation is an oversimplification of the purpose of the law then and the motivation of some pushing the law now. Proponents of this law are pushing the measure as a way that businesses can seek protection "for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage." Whether that argument will win in the courts is up for debate. That was far from an intent of Illinois’ law, or the others passed more than 15 years ago. As for the language itself, Pence is incorrect to say the language is the same. Some pro-LGBT rights groups say the outright inclusion of a corporation or company as a "person" is overly broad, though the true impact will likely only really be settled when matters are sent to a court. Overall, Pence’s claim is partially accurate but misses important context.

pomt-07674	Says iPads and iPhones "are built in the United States of America."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/09/john-mccain/john-mccain-errs-saying-ipads-iphones-are-made-us/	On the March 6, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, the host asked Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., about the report she had just aired about American competitiveness. "Well, I think it's obviously a recognition of the reality and the trends, that cheaper, lower-cost labor products will usually prevail over the products made in higher wage and income countries," McCain said. "But I would also point out that, if you'd emptied (a house shown in the earlier segment) -- if you'd left a computer there or an iPad or an iPhone, those are built in the United States of America. And as the president said, continuously, and I agree with him, innovation is the key to us being able to restore our economy." Critics immediately jumped on McCain’s statement that the devices "are built in the United States of America." The answer is inscribed on the back of every iPhone: "Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China." When we contacted McCain’s office, spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan confirmed that the senator had been in error and had corrected himself in interviews later on Sunday. "Sen. McCain is aware the iPhone, iPad, and other Apple products were designed in the United States but manufactured elsewhere," said Buchanan. In fact, one of Apple’s key manufacturing contractors in China, Foxconn, has attracted attention over the years for allegations of worker abuse. (Apple did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) It’s true that Apple, a U.S.-based company, has thrived in the global market against foreign-based competitors. But McCain was wrong to suggest that iPads and iPhones "are built in the United States of America." They aren’t. So we rate his comment False.

pomt-10998	"Shocking Video Emerges of Obama Mocking God and the Bible."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/blog-posting/old-obama-video-misrepresents-his-views-christiani/	Throughout Barack Obama’s presidency, critics questioned his Christian beliefs. The suspicion among some conservative Facebook groups has continued a year and a half after his exit from the White House. One group, called Yes I’m Right, shared a link to an article titled "Shocking Video Emerges of Obama Mocking God and the Bible." Hundreds of users reacted and shared the link, which led to a Conservative Post write-up and video. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook’s News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We looked at the video. It has been around since 2006 and is clipped from a larger 40-minute speech about separating religious beliefs from policymaking. Strategic editing The Conservative Post article is just a few sentences long, accusing Obama of an "open universalist attitude toward faith" and say that his faith is "100% phony." According to his biographies, Obama became a practicing Christian in early adulthood when he began working with religious community groups in Chicago. According to reports during his time in office, he prayed daily and would regularly consult with pastors for spiritual guidance. In the attached 3-and-a-half minute video, Obama does not denigrate Christianity. He is shown arguing for political compromise across religions. "We are no longer a Christian nation, or at least not just," he says, "We are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, and a Buddhist nation, and a Hindu nation, and a nation of non-believers." Because of this, Obama argues, making political policy based solely on religious beliefs is unsustainable. He gives the example of a Christian who objects to abortion on religious grounds: Though they may feel strongly that is wrong because of their religion, he says, they cannot use the Bible as their evidence. Obama also notes that, if the government was led by religion, many books of the Bible would not be applicable for making policy. As the audience laughs, he says that Leviticus, which condones slavery but forbids shellfish, or Deuteronomy, which allows for the stoning of wayward children, would not be suitable for modern laws. This might be interpreted as disrespect or mocking by some viewers. However, the video is cut from a much larger speech: Obama’s keynote at the "Building a Covenant for a New America" conference in 2006. The conference was sponsored by Sojourners, a progressive Christian magazine. In Obama’s 40-minute address, he urges Democrats to embrace religion, rather than shy away from it or decry it. Even if religious arguments are not sufficient for making policy, the moral lessons that religions teach can be essential for guiding decisions and reaching out to others. So when viewed as a whole, the point of the speech is not to mock Christianity. Unlikely sources Here’s where things get interesting: the video wasn’t edited together by conservative groups seeking to discredit Obama’s religious views. It was edited and posted originally by an online spiritual group in favor of Obama. Founded in the mid 1990s, Yoism is an "open-source religion" in which participants can continually propose new tenets and beliefs. The group votes on the proposals, and then adds them to the Book of Yo. Though the book has not been updated since 2004, it appears the website remained active and politically vocal throughout the Obama presidency, frequently defending his policies. The Yoism site attached the video underneath a Doonesbury cartoon about Christmas decorations and short article praising Obama for his commitment to the separation of church and state. Using the same video that was shared by Conservative Post, the Yoans applauded Obama’s Christian values. Our ruling Obama gave a speech in 2006 that encouraged Christians to take a compromising approach to their religious values when creating policy. He spoke extensively about his own experience as a Christian and encouraged the crowd of Democrats to use their religion to guide them on moral issues. He does emphasize the extremity of many of the Bible stories, perhaps in a way that some Christians would feel is disrespectful. However, the few snippets of Obama’s longer speech do not accurately reflect his views on Christianity overall, and it is an overstatement to say that he is mocking God. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01318	Says Sen. Rand Paul’s 2011 budget "included a big cut in the CDC."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/27/doug-muder/blog-sen-paul-wanted-big-cut-cdc-2011/	We don’t know yet if the Ebola scare will help either party or be an afterthought in the midterm elections, but liberal blogger Doug Muder argued that confronting Ebola shows that it makes sense to vote Democratic. For Muder, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul is the poster child for a distinct partisan contrast. "Ebola points out why we need a fully funded government," Muder wrote. "When there’s no immediate threat of disease, government agencies like the CDC look like bureaucratic waste. When Rand Paul put out a ‘Tea Party budget’ in 2011, it included a big cut in the CDC, and virtually no explanation as to how this would affect its mission." In this fact-check, we look at whether Paul proposed a "big cut" in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Muder had blogged about Paul’s budget in 2011. Back then, Muder asked how the CDC would be able to fulfill its mission if, as Paul wanted, its budget was cut by $1.165 billion. We went back to Paul’s original budget documents. One posted January 2011 called for the $1.165 billion reduction that Muder mentioned. Paul then assembled a more complete budget plan in May 2011. It would cut the CDC budget by 20 percent from its Fiscal Year 2008 levels. Depending on whether you include special funds to evaluate federal health programs, Congress appropriated between $6.049 billion and $6.375 billion for the CDC in FY 2008. So Rand’s 20 percent reduction amounts to either $1.209 billion or $1.275 billion in cuts. That’s slightly more than Muder described. Paul wrote in his plan, "The center is often mentioned in media reports highlighting their lavish accommodations. For example, in 2005, the CDC built a conference center for $106 million, complete with large-screen plasma TVs. They also spent tens of millions of dollars on state-of-the-art anti-gravity seating for employees, as well as luxury furniture. Taxpayers can no longer afford the luxury working atmosphere of the CDC." That budget plan remains posted on the website randpaul2016.com, Paul's Senate re-election website. Brian Darling, a Paul spokesman, agreed that the senator has proposed these cuts in the past, but said that funding and the ability to fight Ebola don’t inevitably go hand-in-hand. "If you look closely at the CDC budget, there are funds that have been wasted on projects that have nothing to do with disease prevention," Darling said. Darling then noted that Congress has been at least as supportive of the CDC as the Obama administration. Darling said that in an omnibus spending bill, Congress appropriated $6.9 billion for the CDC, about $240 million more than the administration requested. Darling highlighted another $88 million for Ebola in a continuing resolution bill approved in September. However, neither action undercuts Muder’s point, and Paul voted against both measures. It’s important to remember that those bills doled out money across many government agencies, not specifically for the CDC alone. Sometimes reasonable people can quibble over whether a cut is "big" or not. In this case, Paul himself called his cuts "serious" in a 2011 op-ed he penned for the Wall Street Journal. "My proposal, not surprisingly, has been greeted skeptically in Washington, where serious spending cuts are a rarity," Paul wrote. "But it is a modest proposal when measured against the size of our mounting debt." Our ruling Muder said that in 2011 Sen. Paul proposed cutting the CDC budget by $1.165 billion. Budget documents confirm that. In fact, Paul’s most detailed budget that year would have trimmed CDC spending by slightly more, about $1.2 billion. While the Senate approved two broad spending measures to fund the CDC in 2014, Paul voted against both. We rate the claim True.	None	Doug Muder	None	None	None	2014-10-27T15:42:23	2014-10-20	['None']
pomt-10897	"We have the most educated … workforce in the entire nation."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/aug/05/jb-pritzker/pritzker-called-illinois-workforce-nations-most-ed/	In a typical race for governor, the incumbent would be the one talking up his state’s strengths while the challenger might lament shortcomings. But nothing is typical about the battle between incumbent Republican Bruce Rauner and Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker. Defying convention, Rauner has spent a good portion of his term stressing the negative. He has said Illinois is in a "death spiral" and complained that Indiana is "kicking our tails." A few weeks ago, Rauner had to do damage control after publicly dissing the workforce in Downstate Champaign-Urbana, home of the main campus of the University of Illinois. With the incumbent routinely calling into question the state’s ability to attract business, Pritzker recently tried the opposite tack in a video tweeted out by his campaign. "We have the most educated, dedicated workforce in the entire nation and that is why businesses want to come here," Pritzker says in the clip, which features footage of the candidate visiting offices, farms and classrooms. Tops in the nation is a high bar to meet when it comes to assessing the educational achievement of Illinois workers. So we thought Pritzker’s claim worth checking out. Cum laude, yes—but certainly not summa "Dedicated" is an unknowable state of mind, so it’s impossible to assess the second beat of Pritzker’s statement. Educational achievement, however, is a widely measured concept. A report ranking states from most to least educated produced by the financial information site WalletHub, for instance, received considerable coverage this year. And U.S. News & World Report also routinely releases lists of the states with the highest education levels. Neither ranks Illinois as number one among states—or even in the top ten. We asked Pritzker’s campaign to explain Illinois’ absence from the top of those rankings, and spokesman Jason Rubin didn’t attempt to back up his boss with facts. Instead, Rubin reframed Pritzker’s statement as opinion. "Unlike Bruce Rauner, J.B. Pritzker believes Illinois has the most dedicated, educated workforce in the country," Rubin wrote in an email. The gold standard for ranking education achievement among the states is the U.S. Census, which also provides estimates for the share of each state’s workforce that holds degrees. That is a metric more closely in line with Pritzker’s claim. On that count, Illinois fares slightly better than it did in the broader assessments from WalletHub and U.S. News. According to the Census, nearly 40 percent of Illinois’ labor force had attained at least a Bachelor’s degree as of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That puts Illinois’ workforce in 10th place nationally. Tops on the list was Massachusetts. By a slightly different measure, Minnesota leads the states when it comes to the share of the labor force with at least some college credit or a community college Associate’s degree. Illinois was 13th. Illinois does, however, have an edge over its immediate neighboring states when it comes to its share of college-educated workers, census data show. That is a factor that could bear importance for white-collar businesses looking to relocate to the region. Chicago-based demographer Rob Paral said that’s not surprising given that Chicago, which is home to roughly one-fifth of Illinois’ population, boasts the highest percentage of college graduates among the nation’s seven largest cities. Our ruling Pritzker said Illinois has "the most educated workforce … in the entire nation." But census figures show the state ranks tenth for the share of its workforce that holds a Bachelor's degree or higher. When pressed, Pritzker’s campaign made no attempt to back up his claim, restating it as a matter of opinion rather than fact. Pritzker’s praise for the educational prowess of Illinois’ workforce is not entirely out of left field, but it falls well short of the numbers. We rate it False.

pomt-14580	"Owen in MA vs. Owen in RI … Advantage:Rhode Island."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2016/feb/07/gina-raimondo/advantage-ri-aimed-ge-not-owen/	As she tried to bring General Electric to Rhode Island, one of Gov. Gina Raimondo’s more interesting sales pitches involved "Owen." A character in various General Electric television ads, Owen is a young man thrilled about the prospect of working as a programmer for the old-line industrial and financial services company looking to become a Silicon-Valley-style data giant. Page 14 of Rhode Island’s PowerPoint presentation to GE portrays "Bay State Owen," who earns a $109,000 salary, and "Ocean State Owen," who makes $93,000. The governor’s Massachusetts Owen pays $2,300 per month for rent while Rhode Island Owen only pays $1,500. The headline is "Owen in MA vs. Owen in RI" and the sub-headline proclaims: "Advantage: Rhode Island." Initially, we thought Raimondo was saying Owen does better if he works in Rhode Island. We weren’t the only ones judging from the comments online. When we did the math, we concluded it was definitely not financially advantageous for Owen to work in Rhode Island. Even after paying $800 more for rent in Massachusetts, the bespectacled software developer still earns $500 more per month, according to numbers in the brochure that Raimondo says she shared with GE. Subtracting rent, Owen would make $81,400 per year in Massachusetts versus $75,000 in Rhode Island. Raimondo’s claim became a lightning rod for some commenters posting on providencejournal.com. Taking Owen’s side, one commenter on providencejournal.com: "This page actually shows MA being better than RI." That wasn’t the only one. But Raimondo wasn’t making a pitch to prospective employees. She was trying to court Owen’s employer. Raimondo’s point was that GE can pay Owen $16,000 less if the company sets up its headquarters in Rhode Island. The "Rhode Island advantage" isn’t for Owen. It’s for GE. Raimondo’s spokeswoman, Marie Aberger, confirmed this and provided source information for the numbers on salary and rent: The numbers check out. The mean yearly wage for software programmers in Massachusetts is about $109,000 per year and about $93,000 in Rhode Island, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rent data came from Zillow. Our ruling There are lots of factors, beyond salaries and rental costs, that govern which state is best for GE or best for Owen. But when looking only at Owen’s prospective salary and rental costs, it’s clear Rhode Island is more advantageous for GE, which was the target of Raimondo’s presentation. The ruling is True. The question that can’t be answered, of course, is how much Owen might value living in Boston’s Seaport district as opposed to, say, Providence’s West End.

pomt-02855	"The (health care) law does not demand that all of these cancellations go out."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/17/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-health-care-law-doesnt-require-insurance-co/	President Barack Obama’s apology and administrative pivot to stop a wave of insurance plan cancellations has hardly quieted accusations that he misled millions of Americans when he said "If you like your plan, you can keep it." Facing these criticisms, the Democratic leadership has rallied around the president. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said he actually took more blame for what happened than he might deserve. "The law does not demand that all of these cancellations go out," Pelosi said on NBC’s Meet the Press. We have looked at variations of this claim before, most recently when former Obama adviser Ezekiel Emanuel said, "The insurance companies are making that choice (to cancel or change policies), not the president." Our conclusions remain the same. While there’s an element of truth to the statement, it ignores the ways that the Affordable Care Act pushes insurance companies to change the plans they offer. The Affordable Care Act sets certain standards for the services pretty much every plan must cover. There are 10 "essential health benefits" and the list includes emergency services, maternity care and mental health care. If policyholders bought plans before Obama signed his reform into law on March 23, 2010, they’re considered "grandfathered." They can keep their plans, so long as those plans don’t change much. We don’t have good information on how many cancellation notices are for plans that could continue if the insurance company wanted. But we do know two things. First, it doesn’t take much for a plan to lose its grandfathered status. A hike in a co-pay of $5 plus the rate of medical inflation could tip a plan over the edge. Second, once a plan is poised to lose its grandfathered status, it’s on the road to oblivion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, says that if an insurer wants to end a policy, it needs to give policyholders 90 days notice as well as information about alternative coverage plans that insurer is offering. That’s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders have been getting in the mail these days. Pelosi’s spokesman, Drew Hammill, told PolitiFact that insurance companies have options. "Except for these ‘grandfathered plans’ health insurers in the individual market have to adopt new consumer protections," Hammill said. "In some instances, insurers are doing this by cancelling current plans rather than simply upgrading them. Nothing in the law requires the cancellation of plans as the leader said today." Some health policy experts told us that yes, in a technical sense, insurers are pulling the plug on these old, grandfathered policies. Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor, said that "if a grandfathered plan is being terminated, it is the insurer’s decision -- nothing in the law requires it." But other experts said that while this is technically true, it gives a distorted view of what’s going on. The law places grandfathered plans in such a straitjacket -- unable to attract new individual policyholders and unable to adjust terms to market conditions -- that it’s only a matter of time before companies are driven to pull the plug. To ignore the government’s role in establishing the parameters for this highly regulated and highly competitive industry, they say, is substantially misleading. "Insurance companies cannot continue to sell individual policies that don’t meet the requirements of the essential benefit package, either to individuals or to small businesses, as of Jan. 1," said Gail Wilensky, the head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "But since the insurance companies are not allowed to continue to sell these plans that the person previously had bought and may have liked, they are effectively being forced to change their plan." By all accounts, even the employers who are offering grandfathered plans to their employees are dwindling over time. The annual study of health insurance by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust found that the percentage of workers enrolled in grandfathered plans has decreased from 56 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2013. Another study, by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, found that of the one-quarter of organizations that still have a grandfathered plan, less than half expect to keep their grandfathered status beyond the next two years. In other words, the grandfathered plan is slowly but steadily becoming a dinosaur. Our ruling Pelosi said the Affordable Care Act doesn’t require insurance companies to send out the cancellation notices that people have been getting. While there’s some element of truth to this statement, one of the major thrusts of the law is it sets minimum standards. The law intentionally makes it difficult for companies to avoid these minimums and the industry has responded by moving away from sub-par plans. Pelosi’s statement ignores the factors in the law that push companies in a certain direction. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2013-11-17T13:58:32	2013-11-17	['None']
pomt-01916	On a balanced budget amendment.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/30/mark-warner/warner-has-changed-position-balanced-budget-amendm/	U.S. Republican senate candidate Ed Gillespie is accusing Democratic incumbent Mark Warner of switching positions on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. A web video released by Gillespie’s campaign shows a montage of two contrasting statements Warner has made over the years as evidence the Democrat has "promised Virginians one thing on the campaign trail and changed his position in Washington." The video starts with footage from Warner’s unsuccessful a 1996 campaign to unseat incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. John Warner. During a debate that summer, Mark Warner was asked to name issues on which he disagreed with his party and then-President Bill Clinton. "I also believe we need a constitutional amendment balancing the budget," Warner said. "For too long Congress, even though politician after politician makes promises that we’ll balance the budget soon, year after year the deficit goes up. I think we need constitutional amendment to balance that budget, and we need it now." The video contrasts that statement, which Warner echoed throughout that campaign, to comments he made during a April 2011 interview with CNN. The Democrat had been elected to the Senate in 2008 and, a month prior to the interview, voted against a Republican bill for a balanced budget amendment. "Listen, I was a governor. We had to balance our budgets," Warner told CNN. "I don’t think a federal balanced budget amendment gets us where we need to be." Supporters of the balanced budget amendment have long maintained that the provision would mandate spending discipline by Congress. Opponents say a balanced budget can’t be achieved without painful tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts, including to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman, acknowledged that the senator’s position on the amendment has changed, but said it’s old news. The turning point, he said, came shortly after Warner became governor in 2002 and took charge of a state government that had its own balanced budget requirement. Despite that constitutional amendment, the state was emerging from recession and faced massive budget shortfalls because of low revenues and a car tax cut ushered in by the previous administration. Warner and the General Assembly balanced the budgets through spending cuts and tax increases and, when the economy improved later in his term, the state budget ended up in surplus. Warner told CNN in 2011 that he is convinced that when it comes to managing federal finances, long-term bipartisan planning is a superior way to lowering debt than a balanced budget amendment. Warner, during his first term, has led a group of senators seeking a bipartisan agreement to lowering deficits through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. We couldn’t find any record of Warner weighing in on a balanced budget amendment between 1996 and 2011. The issue did not come up in two debates viewed from his 2008 Senate campaign or in any of news stories we accessed from that election. There’s no evidence Warner promised voters he’d support the amendment during the 2008 campaign that put him in the Senate and recanted after he took office. Our ruling The purpose of our Flip-O-Meter is to gauge how much a politician’s position on an issue has changed. We don’t take a position on whether the change is good or bad. There’s no doubt Warner has reversed course on a balanced budget amendment over the years. So we rate it a Full Flop.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2014-06-30T00:00:00	2011-04-03	['None']
