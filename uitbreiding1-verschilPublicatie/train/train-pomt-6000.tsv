pomt-03070	"The United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — (voted) to keep our government open."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/30/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-democrats-and-republicans-senate/	As the United States government hurtles toward a shutdown, the blame game is well under way. Congress and the White House are at loggerheads over what to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law. Major aspects of the law are set to go live on Oct. 1, the same day as funding for the federal government runs out. But efforts to keep the funding flowing have floundered on the demand of some Republicans to defund or delay the law. The president, for his part, has refused to eliminate or pare back his signature legislative achievement. We noticed two similar, but opposite, claims about how the parties broke on key votes in the conflict. Here, we will look at a claim by Obama. In a separate fact-check, we’ll look at one by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Obama’s comment on Sept. 27, 2013, came shortly after the Senate passed a bill to keep federal funding flowing but without a provision that would defund Obama’s law. "If Congress chooses not to pass a budget by Monday — the end of the fiscal year — they will shut down the government, along with many vital services that the American people depend on," Obama said in an appearance before reporters in the White House. "The good news is, within the past couple of hours, the United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open and delivering the services the American people expect." Was it accurate to say that "The United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open"? As Politico noted shortly after Obama made the claim, Obama is incorrect, at least by the most literal reading. The final measure passed by a 54-42 margin, with two Republicans not voting. All 54 who voted for the measure were either Democrats or independents who caucus with the Democrats. All 42 who voted against the measure were Republicans. Not a single member of the Senate crossed party lines on that vote. When we asked the White House to explain, a spokesman pointed not to the final vote but rather to the preliminary vote to proceed to debate, known as a "cloture vote." Being able to proceed to a final vote requires reaching a 60-vote threshold, assuming all senators are present and voting. In this case, the cloture vote did indeed pass by a 79-19 margin, with two senators not voting. Of the 79 votes in favor of cloture, 25 came from Republicans -- a strong showing in these polarized days. "I'd refer you to the comments of Senate Republicans on the Senate floor on Thursday and Friday who voted for cloture, saying that they opposed Obamacare but that they didn't believe they should shut down the government over it," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. "So, they voted to keep it open. That was a strong bipartisan vote." The White House has a point that not every Republican who voted against the "clean" continuing resolution on final passage -- that is, on the version that was stripped of the language to defund Obamacare -- did so to protest the removal of the defunding language. To the contrary, the proposal, advanced by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and others, deeply split the Republican Party over legislative tactics. However, Obama went too far when he said the "Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open." He didn’t say that Democrats and Republicans alike preferred to avoid a shutdown, a claim that would be largely accurate. He specifically said members of both parties voted to advance that goal. The problem, veterans of congressional procedure say, is that the significant Republican support for cloture should be seen as a way to move the process along, so that all options can be exhausted, not as an expression that they support the underlying bill. Only Democrats, not Republicans, voted in a way that supported the final version of the bill. "The cloture vote is a vote to end debate, and not on the substance of the matter you are voting to end debate on," said Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee. The fact that so many Republicans supported ending debate, he said, suggests they "wanted to advance the ball to expedite the ping-pong match of negotiations over various options before the fiscal new year's ball hit the ground." Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, added that he sees "a kernel of truth" in the statement, but one "surrounded by a lot of fleshy falsehood." Our ruling Obama said, "The United States Senate — Democrats and Republicans — acted responsibly by voting to keep our government open." The president has a point that 25 Republicans backed a procedural motion to proceed to the bill itself. But experts said that when analyzing Obama’s comment, it’s more important to note that not a single Republican ultimately voted "to keep our government open" when the chamber took up the bill itself.

pomt-03746	Air travelers "can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check" on them.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/09/dannel-malloy/air-travelers-get-background-checks-some-gun-buyer/	Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, whose state is still mourning the massacre of 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school, is pushing for a federal expansion of background checks on gun purchases. In an interview on MSNBC, Malloy cited strong public support for expanded checks and claimed that another, more pedestrian area of American life is more tightly controlled than weapon transfers. "I’m a governor. I can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me, but I could go places in this country and buy a weapon and not have that done. It makes no sense to anybody, quite frankly," he said. We wondered if that’s true -- that air travelers are subject to background checks, and how it compares with the requirements on gun purchases. First, guns. Federal law requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers -- such as those selling at gun shows -- to do such background checks. Gun control advocates want the background check requirement expanded to cover those and other private purchases. According to federal figures, applicants who are denied a firearm through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System are rejected for having a prior criminal conviction or restraining order, being a fugitive from justice or in the United States illegally, being under indictment or having been dishonorably discharged from the military. Others are denied because they failed to acknowledge their record on the initial form. So what’s required of air travelers? Malloy’s spokeswoman, Juliet Manalan, told us that Malloy was referring to the Secure Flight program, created in response to the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation of uniform pre-screening of passenger information against government watch lists. The program, run by the Transportation Security Administration, requires airline passengers to provide their name, date of birth and gender to be matched against watch lists including the "no fly" list. That list, which is classified, contains the names of suspected terrorists who are barred from boarding planes flying in or out of the United States. It does not bar felons or other convicted criminals from flying. "In short: there is a list that prevents people from boarding a plane, but no list that prevents people who shouldn’t have firearms from purchasing them," Manalan said. So there’s a list, but is there a background check? Not exactly, and not a criminal one. "Passengers names are checked against the no-fly and selectee list via the Secure Flight process, but they do not undergo the fingerprint-based criminal history record check/security threat assessment process that airport/airline employees undergo," said Jeffrey Price, an aerospace professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver. Douglas Laird, an independent aviation security expert, called it a stretch to describe the airline procedure as a background check. "TSA runs the data received from the airlines computer reservations systems through various databases, but this is not a background check by any stretch of the imagination," Laird said. Still, there is a definite security element to the airlines’ process. "It is basic information, but the airlines could use it for a background check. I believe that is what (Malloy) is trying to say," said Clifford Winston, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution. "I don’t think it is the case that before you can buy a ticket, you have to undergo a background check." Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with the advisory firm Hudson Crossing, added, "It may not be a true ‘background check,’ but passenger data is passed through a database (possibly more than one) to detect possible terrorists." Our ruling Malloy said he "can’t get on a plane in the United States without someone doing a background check on me," while less oversight exists for gun purchases. Background checks on gun purchases -- which assess a person’s criminal history -- do not apply to the private transfer of weapons, only to purchases from licensed gun dealers. And it’s true that many guns are bought legally with no background check. But the Secure Flight program does not check people’s legal history in the same way. It compares passenger information with lists of suspected terrorists. It’s a security measure, but not a true background check. Though unlike with guns, it applies to everyone. Malloy’s statement is only partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Dannel Malloy	None	None	None	2013-04-09T11:32:16	2013-04-03	['United_States']
pomt-03999	Says Texas ranks last in the percentage of residents with high school diplomas.	true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/08/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-ranks-last-res/	In an editorial poking at Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch for California businesses to ogle Texas, the Sacramento Bee's editorial board said Texas ranks poorly in several ways. The editorial says, for instance: "Yes, come check out Texas. Check out a state that ranks dead last in the percent of its population with high school diplomas." (Click here to read our evaluations of more Bee claims.) Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, pointed us to an Aug. 22, 2011, San Francisco Chronicle news article on Perry’s record. That story draws on the Legislative Study Group, a caucus of the Texas House whose staff analyzes legislation and makes recommendations to its members, which during the 2011 session included one Republican and 48 Democrats. The story quotes the study group as saying Texas is "dead last in the number of residents over 25 who have a high school diploma." Texas was last by its lonesome a few years ago, we found, but it shared the dubious ranking with California and another state in 2011, the latest year researched. Nationally in 2011, nearly 86 percent of adults 25 or older had completed high school or the equivalent, according to results from that year’s American Community Survey, a mail survey that the U.S. Census Bureau annually sends to more than 2 million households. Among the states, Montana led the nation, with 92.3 percent of adults clearing the high-school hurdle, according to the survey, while Texas ranked last, with 81.1 percent of its adults having completed high school. However, the Texas rate matched the rates for Mississippi and California, according to the bureau. For both Texas and California, the bureau says, the margin of error was plus or minus 0.2 percentage points. States with better results included Louisiana (82.5 percent); Alabama (82.7 percent); Kentucky (83.1 percent); New Mexico (83.2 percent); and Arkansas (83.8 percent), the bureau says. We asked the Texas state demographer, Lloyd Potter, about the bureau’s figures. By email, Potter said the survey is "really the one standard we have for cross-state comparisons." He pointed out, too, that the Texas tie with two states in 2011 marks an improvement from 2010, when the survey indicated Texas was tied for last with California, and from 2009, when the survey placed Texas last by itself. Our ruling The Bee’s editorial board said Texas ranks last in its share of residents with high school diplomas. That’s right, though Texas lately has company. In 2011, the Lone Star state tied for last with Mississippi and California. In each state, 81.1 percent of adults 25 and older had completed high school or the equivalent, the government says. We rate this claim as True.	None	Sacramento Bee Editorial Board	None	None	None	2013-02-08T14:04:17	2013-02-06	['None']
pomt-07589	"A U.S. Government Accountability Office report says Planned Parenthood Federation of America cannot find some $1.3 billion given to it by the federal government from 2002 through 2008."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/25/worldnetdaily/planned-parenthood-funding-did-gao-really-find-mil/	Congress is looking to reduce federal spending, and one of the organizations under scrutiny is Planned Parenthood, a group that promotes contraception and family planning. Planned Parenthood is also a well-known abortion provider. Opponents of abortion charge that while Planned Parenthood gets federal dollars ostensibly tagged for preventive health care -- things like pap smears and HIV prevention -- the money supports the overall organization and its abortion services. We noticed one argument made by several websites and columnists recently, that Planned Parenthood was awarded more money from the federal government than it spent. One of the earlier versions of the claim was from the conservative website WorldNetDaily. A July 2010 news report said: "A U.S. Government Accountability Office report says Planned Parenthood Federation of America cannot find some $1.3 billion given to it by the federal government from 2002 through 2008." WorldNetDaily’s statement was made last year, but we feel it’s fair to check since it’s being repeated now that Planned Parenthood is again in the news. WorldNetDaily went on to note that Planned Parenthood had received $2.02 billion in federal grants from 2002 through 2008, even though "the nation's largest abortion-industry player only reported spending $657.1 million of the taxpayer funds." Did the GAO find that $1.3 billion in funds went missing? We decided to check it out. The official number: $657.1 million The Government Accountability Office report in question, published May 28, 2010, compiled federal funds disbursed to family planning agencies for the fiscal years 2002 to 2009. The agencies included Advocates for Youth, the Guttmacher Institute, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Population Council and the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States. Members of Congress who requested the report oppose funding for abortion providers. But we should note that the GAO is a nonpartisan, respected office, whose findings are often cited by both parties. The report documented how much different groups received from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for HIV/AIDS, family planning, and reproductive health, both in the United States and abroad. The report stated that Planned Parenthood spent $657.1 million in federal funds between 2002 and 2009. That was the amount Planned Parenthood itself reported to the government in the form of audited annual reports, which the GAO described as "sufficiently reliable for our purposes." The WorldNetDaily account said unequivocally that "the GAO report said that Planned Parenthood had received $2.02 billion in federal grants from 2002 through 2008 but that the nation's largest abortion-industry player only reported spending $657.1 million of the taxpayer funds." But there was no statement nor any evidence anywhere in the GAO report that Planned Parenthood received $2.02 billion or that any money was missing. The other number: $2 billion The first reference we found to $2 billion or more was a June 2010 op-ed in the Washington Times by Rita Diller, the national director of Stop Planned Parenthood, which is part of the American Life League. (Diller is quoted in the WorldNetDaily story. We contacted her for comment but did not hear back.) In 2010, Diller wrote that "Planned Parenthood Federation of America’s (PPFA) audits show the organization spent just $657.1 million between 2002 and 2008 from federal government grants and programs, but the abortion behemoth’s own annual reports show that it took in $2.3 billion from government grants and programs during the same time period." Unlike WorldNetDaily, Diller made it clear that she was questioning the difference between the GAO report and Planned Parenthood's previously published numbers. Diller’s Stop Planned Parenthood web site tracks money that Planned Parenthood lists in its annual reports. According to those reports, Planned Parenthood received a total of $2.02 billion in federal funding for the years 2002 to 2008. We compared the information from Diller’s site with Planned Parenthood’s actual annual reports and found the numbers appeared to be in order. Different ways to count the money So the GAO report never said that there was $2 billion in funds with only $657 million spent. But it still raises the question: Why the difference between the GAO report and Planned Parenthood’s annual reports? The report itself explains one difference. GAO said it was not able to count all the federal funds that ultimately go to Planned Parenthood, because sometimes the group receives government contracts or grants indirectly. The Department of Health and Human Services, for example, gives grants to states that then give money to Planned Parenthood. Similarly, USAID gives money to other groups that sometimes subcontract with Planned Parenthood. The report didn’t include those funds. "As a result, obligations and disbursements in this report may understate the actual amount of federal funds provided to the selected organizations and their affiliates," the report noted. We next contacted Planned Parenthood. Spokesman Tait Sye offered several additional reasons for the difference between the amount in the GAO report and Planned Parenthood's numbers. • In its annual reports, Planned Parenthood reports all government funding as one category, which includes federal, state and local funding. The GAO report counted only direct federal funding. • Planned Parenthood sometimes gets money from Medicaid, a state-federal partnership that offers health insurance to the poor. The GAO report does not appear to count money from Medicaid. • Planned Parenthood has more than 80 affiliates, many of which get subcontracts paid for with federal funding. The GAO report noted that it only counted money for 21 affiliates. Finally, Sye noted that the federal funding Planned Parenthood receives is routinely audited to make sure it is spent appropriately. Our ruling WorldNetDaily wrote, "A U.S. Government Accountability Office report says Planned Parenthood Federation of America cannot find some $1.3 billion given to it by the federal government from 2002 through 2008." We found other websites making similar claims. The GAO never reported that Planned Parenthood and its affiliates couldn’t find $1.3 billion. It simply said that Planned Parenthood spent $657.1 million. The GAO also didn’t say that there was any sort sort of discrepancy or that money was missing, as the headline on WorldNetDaily’s news report said. The website's conclusion was reached by looking at numbers not even mentioned in the GAO report. In fact the statement conflates two different sets of numbers and is an extreme case of comparing apples to oranges, taking one number calculated by the GAO, and another calculated by adding numbers published in Planned Parenthood’s annual reports. The difference is what is claimed to be missing. Planned Parenthood includes all federal, state and local money under the category "government grants and contracts" in its annual reports. The GAO only looked at direct federal funding and noted it was likely undercounting the amount Planned Parenthood receives. The statement irresponsibly suggests misappropriation of federal funds without any evidence. That makes it not just false, but ridiculously so. As a result, we rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-02241	"Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/apr/14/new-hampshire-republican-party/nh-gop-says-jeanne-shaheen-votes-obama-99-percent-/	With midterm elections on the horizon, Republicans have targeted incumbent U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., for her support of President Barack Obama and his health care reform law. Even though Obama won New Hampshire twice, a majority of residents now disapprove of his job performance, and his signature legislative accomplishment -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- remains unpopular in the state, according to findings from the WMUR Granite State Poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. The New Hampshire Republican Party released a web video in March 2014 aimed at capitalizing on those trends. Titled "99 Percent," the video asserts that Shaheen consistently supports the president and "votes with Obama 99 percent of the time." "Sen. Shaheen can run, but she can’t hide from her loyal and unwavering support of the Obama-Biden agenda," NHGOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said in a statement that accompanied the clip. Democrats across the country have been targeted with similar critiques, with varying degrees of accuracy. In 2012, the Ohio Republican Party claimed that Democratic U.S. Sen Sherrod Brown voted with Obama 95 percent of the time. PolitiFact found that claim to be True. In Alaska, one of Sen. Mark Begich’s Republican opponents claimed Begich supported the president’s economic policies 97 percent of the time. That statement earned a Mostly False rating, because the numbers looked at more than just Obama’s economic policies. In reality, most politicians fall in line with the president when their party controls the White House. Still, we decided it would still be useful to dig into Shaheen’s voting record. The 2014 New Hampshire Senate race is shaping up to be a closely watched contest with former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown entering the race on the GOP side. We asked the NHGOP for some evidence to back up their statement about Shaheen’s support for Obama. Executive Director Matt Mowers pointed us toward Congressional Quarterly’s annual presidential position votes report. CQ examines voting patterns for every member of Congress and sorts them in ways that allow comparisons. One of those ways is an annual examination of presidential support, or the number of votes by each lawmaker on bills in which the sitting president has staked a position. The 2013 CQ analysis shows that, out of the pool of votes on which Obama took a clear position, Shaheen’s vote matched the president’s stance 99 percent of the time. We found similar figures across CQ reports since Shaheen took office. CQ put her voting with Obama at least 95 percent of the time each year. Overall, during the five years since Shaheen took office, Shaheen’s votes have aligned with the president’s position 98 percent of the time. That’s pretty close to the figure offered by the state Republican party. However, it’s important to note some limitations of judging Shaheen’s support for the president based solely on the CQ analysis. Shaheen communications director Shripal Shah said the former New Hampshire governor only votes with Obama when it "makes sense for New Hampshire." At times, she has broken with the president, and in some cases on issues that have not come to a vote. For instance, Shah noted that Shaheen opposes an Internet sales tax -- something Obama has endorsed. She also spoke out against another round of military base closures, an idea the Obama administration advanced in budget proposals, and opposed a proposal floated by the president to change Social Security benefits. There are also other ways to measure Shaheen’s voting tendencies. OpenCongress, a nonpartisan legislative tracking service, found that in 2013, Shaheen voted with the majority of Democrats 93.1 percent of the time. That’s less frequently than the average Democrat in the Senate, putting her on the bottom half of the list. In October 2013, a column published in The Telegraph of Nashua by veteran New Hampshire political reporter Kevin Landrigan stated that Shaheen "has had success throughout her political career by carving out issues over which she has crossed party lines to try to get results." And in June 2013, Shaheen was featured as a "Bipartisan Champion" by the Bipartisan Policy Center for her work on energy efficiency legislation. Shaheen’s camp also pointed to the relatively small set of votes considered in the Congressional Quarterly analysis of presidential support. In 2013, for example, the Senate took 291 roll call votes. CQ registers Obama as having taken a clear stance on only 108 of those votes, or about one third. Many were votes on presidential nominations. "It's disingenuous to draw conclusions about Sen. Shaheen's record by only looking at a small number of votes," Shah said. That’s a valid point. But Shaheen didn’t show the same reluctance to evaluate politicians based on presidential support when she first ran for a U.S. Senate seat. During a 2008 debate with then-Sen. John E. Sununu, Shaheen said that Sununu voted with President George W. Bush 90 percent of the time. The NHGOP directed us to a video recording of the debate. Our ruling The New Hampshire Republican Party said that Shaheen votes with Obama 99 percent of the time. Indeed, in 2013, Shaheen took the same position as the president 99 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, based on analysis by Congressional Quarterly. And overall, her votes have aligned with the president’s wishes 98 percent of the time since she took office. We should note that it’s fairly common for a senator to vote in support of a president of the same party and in some cases Shaheen has broken from the President. Still, NHGOP’s claim about Shaheen wasn’t far off. If the party had specified it was referring only to votes in 2013, the advertisement would have been right on the money. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	New Hampshire Republican Party	None	None	None	2014-04-14T16:30:09	2014-03-24	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-15015	"States with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/06/barack-obama/obama-more-gun-laws-means-fewer-gun-deaths/	In the wake of a Oct. 1 shooting spree in Oregon that killed 10, many -- including President Barack Obama -- are calling for more gun control laws. "There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America," Obama said in remarks the day of the shooting. "So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer? We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths. So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens, and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence." There is plenty of debate over the effectiveness of gun control laws, so we decided to dig into Obama’s sweeping claim: that "states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths." We ran this claim past several experts and found that the statistic generally holds up, but the implications are less clear. Cause and effect The meat of the claim comes from a 2015 National Journal investigation, which concluded that "the states with the most gun laws see the fewest gun-related deaths." The report considered seven types of gun control: handgun permits, background checks, handgun registries, "stand your ground" laws, concealed carry permits, open carry permits and gun purchase waiting period. It found that states that had generally more restrictive laws within these categories generally had fewer annual gun deaths. Here’s a chart by National Journal showing the states with the fewest and most gun deaths per 100,000 people, compared to each state’s’ gun laws (more blue = more restrictive laws). You should look at the chart that shows all 50 states. There are some limitations to this kind of research, notably that they do not determine cause-and-effect: whether a state has fewer gun deaths because of the law, said Adam Winkler, a University of California Los Angeles law professor and second amendment expert. Other demographic characteristics -- such as education level, marital stability, rural or urban -- might explain the fewer gun deaths in a particular state. Setting that caveat aside, Winkler said Obama’s statement is true. There are also a couple of outliers to National Journal’s report. For example, New Hampshire has some of the least restrictive gun laws but also the seventh-lowest gun death rate. An academic study published by the American Medical Association in 2013 found similar results: "A higher number of firearm laws in a state was associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in the state." In a commentary on the 2013 study, Garen Wintemute, director of UC Davis’ Violence Prevention Research Program, pointed out that the correlation between restrictive laws and fewer deaths "essentially disappeared" when firearm ownership rates were taken into account. "Perhaps these laws decrease mortality by decreasing firearm ownership, in which case firearm ownership mediates the association," Wintemute wrote. "But perhaps, and more plausibly, these laws are more readily enacted in states where the prevalence of firearm ownership is low — there will be less opposition to them — and firearm ownership confounds the association." While wary of making such a general claim, Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said Obama’s claim is generally accurate. In many states, individual gun laws have shown to be associated with fewer gun-related deaths. He linked us to some of his own research showing, for example, a reduction in murders committed with firearms followed a handgun purchase permit law in Connecticut. In contrast, the repeal of a permit law in Missouri preceded a rise in firearm-caused murders. We looked for evidence to contradict Obama’s statement, and found several complaints from those who favor gun rights. James Agresti, a gun control expert for the conservative-leaning think tank Just Facts, wrote in an email to reporters that statements like Obama’s are "meaningless" and "subjective and ill-defined," linking to a Just Facts article that said classification systems that evaluate gun laws state-by-state can be "haphazard." Agresti added that the claim ignores the number of lives saved by defensive gun use, and the fact that some states with highest gun-ownership rates also have low homicide rates. Overall, though, we found nothing that offered an outright contradiction to the National Journal analysis. States with laws that restrict guns do tend to have lower death rates, as Obama said. Suicide vs. homicide A notable critique of Obama’s claim is that these gun deaths include suicides -- which account for more than half of all gun deaths -- and Obama was delivering remarks in the context of how to prevent future mass shootings. While research does show that gun laws correlate with fewer firearm-caused suicides, there’s not universal agreement on the effect of gun laws on murders. In his commentary on the 2013 study, Wintemute noted that the vast majority of the observed decrease in gun deaths were suicides. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker did a calculation of their own and found that when suicides are taken out of the picture, there’s not as clear a correlation between more gun laws and fewer non-suicide gun deaths. (They rated Obama’s statement as two out of four Pinocchios.) Obama’s use of this factoid is deceptive because he was selling gun control as a way to stymie murders, not suicide by gun, said David Kopel, a gun rights advocate and research director of the conservative Independence Institute in Denver. He likened it to a car salesman telling a family a car is "safe, according to government studies." The family takes this to mean the car will protect them in an accident, but the salesman was actually referring to the fact that studies have found the car to be safe for the environment. Experts do, though, see reason to believe that stronger gun laws will reduce homicides, as well, even if the research isn’t conclusive yet. One survey of about 150 researchers actively publishing work on guns found that 71 percent believe that strong gun laws reduce the number of homicides, compared with12 percent who disagree. While there are always exceptions, "the research on the whole shows that if you make it more difficult for individuals -- especially individuals with a criminal background -- to obtain firearms you will prevent some gun-related criminal offenses," said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida who studies homicide and violent crime. Our ruling Obama said, "States with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths." Research shows that the more gun laws a state has, the fewer gun deaths there are. Obama gets some wiggle room because he said "tend to" as opposed to making a definitive statement. The problem is, however, that this is an overly general statement. The research doesn’t prove a universal cause-and-effect relationship between gun laws and fewer gun deaths; it might just be a correlation. Some laws are more effective than others, and other cultural, demographic or socioeconomic factors might be the driving force behind the number of gun deaths in different states. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True. Correction: This article has been updated to correct the spelling of James Agresti, to clarify his views and to provide links to his original commentaries.

'look at regulations that are already on the books and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of them.'"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/29/barack-obama/obama-claims-his-regulatory-review-unprecedented/	With the economy continuing to languish, many Republicans are clamoring to ease federal regulations on businesses as a way to goose job creation. In a press conference on June 29, 2011, President Barack Obama said that's a priority for him, too. In fact, he claimed, his administration was taking a never-done-before, government-wide look at existing regulations to eliminate ones that don't make sense. "One of the things that my administration has talked about is, is there in fact a tangle of regulations out there that are preventing businesses from growing and expanding as quickly as they should?" Obama said. "Keep in mind that, you know, the business community is always complaining about regulations," Obama said. "When unemployment's at 3 percent, and they're making record profits, they're going to still complain about regulations because, frankly, they want to be able to do whatever they think is going to maximize their profits. "I've got an obligation to make sure that we're upholding smart regulations that protect our air and protect our water and protect our food. You know, if you're flying on a plane, you want to make sure that there are some regulations in place to assure safety in air travel. And so there are some core regulations that we've got to maintain. "What I have done -- and this is unprecedented, by the way; no administration has done this before -- is I've said to each agency, 'Don't just look at current regulations or don't just look at future regulations, regulations that we're proposing. Let's go backwards and look at regulations that are already on the books and if they don't make sense, let's get rid of them.'" We wondered if a systematic review of old regulations was really such an unprecedented effort. And we found it isn't. In 1993, President Bill Clinton created the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR), headed by Vice President Al Gore. Among other things the NPR was tasked with cutting regulatory red tape. On Sept. 30, 1993, when Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 calling for a comprehensive review of regulatory policy, he used language that sounds a lot like Obama's. Here's the directive on existing regulations: "In order to reduce the regulatory burden on the American people, their families, their communities, their State, local, and tribal governments, and their industries; to determine whether regulations promulgated by the executive branch of the Federal Government have become unjustified or unnecessary as a result of changed circumstances; to confirm that regulations are both compatible with each other and not duplicative or inappropriately burdensome in the aggregate; to ensure that all regulations are consistent with the President’s priorities and the principles set forth in this Executive order, within applicable law; and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of existing regulations: (a) Within 90 days of the date of this Executive order, each agency shall submit to OIRA (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs) a program, consistent with its resources and regulatory priorities, under which the agency will periodically review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modified or eliminated so as to make the agency’s regulatory program more effective in achieving the regulatory objectives, less burdensome, or in greater alignment with the President’s priorities and the principles set forth in this Executive order." Elaine Kamarck, a special assistant to Gore who managed the project, told us via e-mail."We conducted, as part of the reinventing government initiative, a regulatory review that resulted in 16,000 pages being cut from the federal register." Kamarck is now a lecturer in public policy at Harvard. Here's how a June 13, 1995, story in the Washington Post described the results: President Clinton said good riddance to 16,000 pages of federal regulations yesterday and took special satisfaction in saying goodbye to a rule on how to test the consistency of southern grits. "I would wager a considerable amount of money that no one will ever write me a letter complaining about the demise of these regulations," Clinton told small business leaders, with all 16,000 pages stacked up next to his lectern. Clinton said the pages were being removed from the Code of Federal Regulations, out of 86,000 pages reviewed with an eye toward eliminating unnecessary red tape. James Gattuso, a senior research fellow in regulatory policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Clinton's executive order directed all agencies to regularly review rules on their books. "That order is still in force, making the Obama directive technically redundant," Gattuso said. And Clinton wasn't the first to initiate comprehensive regulatory review, said Gattuso. In the early 1990's when Gattuso was on the staff of Vice President Dan Quayle, President George H.W. Bush ordered a 90-day (later extended another 120 days) moratorium and review of all existing regulations. "I was on the vice president’s staff at that time working on the initiative and have found the parallels (to now) striking," Gattuso said. In a Jan. 28, 1992, memo to department and agency heads on "Reducing the Burden of Government Regulation," Bush wrote: "I am concerned that, because of the constant pressure to develop new programs, we are not doing nearly enough to review and revise existing programs. For that reason, I ask that each of your agencies set aside a 90-day period, beginning today, to evaluate existing regulations and programs and to identify and accelerate action on initiatives that will eliminate any unnecessary regulatory burden or otherwise promote economic growth." Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, called Obama's comment a "nonsense claim." "I would question whether President Obama has done more in re-examining existing regulations than prior presidents, and if he has I would ask why he wasted the resources," Baker told us via e-mail. "Whatever it is called, presidents are always reviewing regulations to eliminate ones that impose unnecessary burdens." In fact, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report on July 16, 2007, states that, "Every president since President Carter has directed agencies to evaluate or reconsider existing regulations." Obama claims that his administration is doing something unprecedented -- "no administration has done this before," he said -- by having each agency review existing regulations, with an eye toward eliminating ones that don't make sense. Lots of presidents have done that. We rate Obama's statement Pants On Fire.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-06-29T18:55:22	2011-06-29	['None']
pomt-04180	Says personal-injury trial lawyers "have provided over 80 percent of the funding for the Texas Democratic Party for over a decade."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/dec/14/sherry-sylvester/tort-reform-spokeswoman-says-personal-injury-trial/	It’s a Texas axiom that trial lawyers fuel Democratic politics. Still, we were struck by a claim by the spokeswoman for Texans for Lawsuit Reform, which advocates litigation limits. In a Dec. 2, 2012, opinion column in the San Antonio Express-News, Sherry Sylvester said Democrats will not regain ground in statewide elections until the party changes its financial backers and rejects policies routinely pushed in support of personal-injury trial lawyers, whom she called "the primary funders of Texas Democrats." The "personal-injury" descriptive applies to cases in which a plaintiff says injuries occurred due to the actions or negligence of another person or entity. The American Bar Association says most personal-injury cases arise from automobile accidents, though the label also extends to medical malpractice and other events. Sylvester further wrote: "Personal-injury trial lawyers not only have provided over 80 percent of the funding for the Texas Democratic Party for over a decade, trial lawyers provided virtually all the funding for the Bexar County Democratic Party in this election." We focused on the first part of that statement — that more than 80 percent of the state Democratic Party’s funding has come from personal-injury trial lawyers for over a decade, presuming this was not a claim about donations to individual candidates. Indeed, Sylvester said by phone, she based her analysis on the Texas Democratic Party’s contribution and expenditure reports for 2006 through 2010. She said, too, that she should not have said the percentage held "for over a decade" without checking the party’s finance reports for 2002 through 2004, which she did before following up with us by email. From 2002 through 2010, Sylvester said, the state party fielded nearly $15.7 million in contributions, not counting contributions from federal Democratic committees such as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee clearly made in connection with federal races, which Sylvester said is not her focus. Sylvester said $11.75 million, or 75.4 percent of the adjusted total, came from personal-injury trial lawyers or groups steered by them, such as the Texas Democratic Trust, which was a political committee guided by the late Fred Baron, a Dallas lawyer. She later stressed that conclusions should not be reached for 2012 until end-of-year finance reports are filed in January 2013, though rolling in available information for the year only mildly reduces the overall percentage, to 74.7 percent. Next, we made our own run at identifying such contributions to the party from 2002 through fall 2012. This tally is imperfect given that we likely failed to catch some donations or, conversely, filter them out. We also did not research how many contributions were returned; that occasionally happens. At any rate, our calculation is that nearly $14 million of more than $18 million given to the party, or 75 percent, came from trial lawyer interests. Notably, though, the party’s draw from such contributors fluctuated year to year. In 2002, an election year that included every legislative seat and races for statewide office including governor and the U.S. Senate, more than 70 trial-lawyer-connected contributions accounted for about $5.4 million, or 81 percent, of the party’s $6.7 million in contributions, not counting the party-committee donations targeting federal races. Sylvester separately concluded that $5.5 million of $7.7 million in the party’s contributions, 71 percent, came from trial lawyer interests. In 2003, by our calculation, such contributions dipped to 26 percent of about $509,000 donated to the party. Such contributions accounted for 36 percent of the party’s donations in 2004 and 24 percent in 2005--well below 80 percent. Then again, such aid accounted for more than 70 percent of party donations from 2006 through 2010, topping out at 93 percent of donations in 2008. Such donations fell to 40 percent of total donations in 2011 and less than 30 percent part-way through 2012. The group steered by Baron was dominant through the decade, accounting for more than $5 million in contributions. But others also were crucial. Texas 2000, a group organized by trial lawyers, and the Texas Trial Lawyers Association accounted for more than $2.3 million in donations. The Beaumont-based law firm of Provost & Umphrey, ponied up $1 million through October 2008. Nix Patterson & Roach, which has offices in Texarkana, Dallas, Austin and Daingerfield, gave $925,000, while.Houston lawyer John O’Quinn, who has since died, donated $730,000. A Sept. 26, 2002, Austin American-Statesman news article quoted Craig McDonald of Texans for Public Justice, which tracks campaign-finance spending, as saying that Texas 2000 and the Texas Trial Lawyers Association function just as the political committee of Texans for Lawsuit Reform. "Like-minded individuals appoint a treasurer, sit in a circle and throw some money in the hat," he said. Critics including Sylvester have noted that pro-trial groups often have names not revealing their pro-trial leans. Separately, we asked the Democratic Party and the trial-lawyers association about the decade-long share of donations from trial-lawyer interests. Party spokesman Jacob Limón emailed that since Gilberto Hinojosa won election as party chairman in June 2012, trial lawyers have not accounted for the majority of contributions--about $32,000 of $91,000 donated to the party between Hinojosa’s election through late September, 35 percent. Willie Chapman, spokesman for the trial-lawyers association, emailed that while it has not calculated the share of trial-lawyer contributions to either major party, his hunch is that, "whatever the percentage is, using the last decade gives a lot of weight to the multi-year commitment to the Democratic Party made by" Baron. Our ruling Sylvester wrote that for over a decade, personal-injury trial lawyers have accounted for over 80 percent of the Texas Democratic Party’s contributions. When we inquired, she pegged the percentage at 75 percent--what we found as well. So the published percentage is an exaggeration, though certainly trial lawyers have been dominant party benefactors. On another front, this statement failed to clarify that the share of lawyer contributions bounced around year to year. That is, personal-injury attorneys didn’t consistently account for over 80 percent of party receipts. We rate the claim as Mostly True.

pomt-06164	"Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns . . . Mitt Romney still won’t."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/democratic-national-committee/dnc-says-presidential-candidates-usually-release-t/	More than one political opponent has attempted to make an issue of Mitt Romney’s personal fortune. Romney’s years leading the private equity firm Bain Capital — which sometimes made money by laying off workers and closing businesses it had acquired — have led to charges that he is a creature of Wall Street and disconnected from the lives of average Americans. According to the financial disclosure required of all presidential candidates by the Federal Election Commission, Romney’s personal fortune is between $190 million and $250 million. All presidential aspirants are required to file Office of Government Ethics Form 278 with the Federal Election Commission. Details about Romney’s wealth are scarce, however, because he is only required to fill out the standard disclosure form about his assets. And unlike some past and present presidential candidates, Romney has not released his income tax returns during this campaign or in previous races for state and federal office. Another GOP contender, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, has called on Romney to go beyond the legal requirements and release his tax returns. Perry released his own returns in October 2011. The Democratic National Committee raised the tax return issue in a video released earlier this month, "What Is Mitt Romney Hiding?" In it, the DNC makes the point that Romney’s father, then-Michigan Gov. George Romney, released his tax returns during the 1968 primary campaign when he sought the Republican presidential nomination. George Romney put pressure on his opponents by releasing 12 years of income tax returns in November 1967. The DNC narrator states in the video: "Traditionally, presidential candidates release their tax returns. ... Mitt Romney still won’t." So, do presidential candidates really have a tradition of releasing their tax returns? And has Mitt Romney refused to do so? What constitutes a tradition? In the post-Watergate era, many, but not all, primary candidates have released their personal tax returns, in some cases going back decades. Here's a sampling of some recent elections, based on news coverage, publicly available returns and a list put together by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that promotes ethics and accountability. Presidents and vice presidents routinely release their returns in office. 2008 Tax returns were an issue in the 2008 primary campaign. Sen. Barack Obama went first, releasing returns dating back to 2000 in March 2008. Sen. Hillary Clinton waited until April to release tax records dating back to 2000 for herself and former President Bill Clinton. Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., also released tax returns during the primary, but Joe Biden didn’t release his returns until September, when Obama selected him as a running mate. John Edwards did not release tax returns, though he had released a decade of returns in September 2004, when he became John Kerry’s running mate. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who eventually won the Republican nomination, released his individual tax returns in April. Cindy McCain, his wife, initially refused but then released summaries for 2006 and 2007. Romney declined to release returns, as did former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who both had released tax returns during earlier runs for state and municipal office. 2004 All the major Democratic contenders for the nomination released at least one year of tax returns, a list that included Kerry and Edwards, as well as Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Richard Gephardt, Dennis Kucinich and Joseph Lieberman. 2000 George W. Bush largely cleared the GOP field early in the primary season. He and running mate Richard Cheney were the only Republicans to release returns. Vice President Al Gore and his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, then-U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, of New Jersey, both released returns as well. Ralph Nader, whose third party candidacy played a crucial role in deciding the outcome of the general election, did not release his returns. 1996 Among GOP primary candidates in 1996, Sens. Bob Dole, Lamar Alexander and Jack Kemp released their tax returns. Publisher Steve Forbes, columnist Pat Buchanan and Sen. Richard Lugar did not. 1992 In April of that year, Bill Clinton released tax returns dating back to 1980. His closest rival for the nomination, former California governor Jerry Brown, did not. 1988 The top two Democrats in the race to face Vice President Bush, Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, both released returns. 1984 The controversy over tax returns fell on the vice presidential candidates when Geraldine Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro, acquiesced to pressure and released their individual tax returns. After they did, the couple ended up paying more than $50,000 in back taxes. 1980 President Ronald Reagan, who like Romney had refused to release his tax returns during previous campaigns for state and federal office, relented in August and released his tax returns for 1979 after it became clear he was the likely nominee. Reagan’s chief rival for the 1980 nomination, George H.W. Bush, had released his in April, pressuring Reagan to do the same. 1976 Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford both released their 1975 tax returns and it was noted that an investment tax credit signed into law by Ford resulted in a significant tax windfall for a peanut warehouse owned by Carter. Is it true that Romney "won’t" release his tax returns? Romney’s camp did not respond to questions about if and when he would release his income tax returns. In response to the question when the Perry camp raised the issue, a Romney spokeswoman said the campaign would revisit the question during the next tax-filing season, presumably in April. Our Ruling Of 34 presidential and vice presidential candidates reviewed above, only seven -- Brown, Buchanan, Huckabee, Forbes, Giuliani, Lugar, Nader -- declined to release personal tax returns. So while most follow the practice, not all do. We rate the DNC’s claim Mostly True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2011-12-16T10:50:10	2011-12-06	['None']
pomt-14465	"Every Republican Senate candidate has now announced whether or not they support the Senate taking up the Supreme Court vacancy…except for Congressman Heck."	false	/nevada/statements/2016/mar/03/nevada-state-democratic-party/is-joe-heck-the-only-senate-candidate/	Reluctance by Senate Republicans to confirm President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court pick after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia is giving Democrats across the country plenty of political ammunition. It’s also playing out in Nevada, where the state Democratic Party is repeatedly slamming Republican Senate candidate and U.S. Rep Joe Heck over his measured, non-committal position on filling the vacancy. Party operatives have unleashed at least five press releases and countless tweets and emails attacking Heck over his stated preference that "each entity should exercise its prerogative." But one attack stuck out as particularly noteworthy — the claim that "every" Republican Senate candidate other than Heck has announced a position on taking up the vacancy. Here’s what party spokeswoman Sarah Zukowski said: "Every Republican Senate candidate has now taken a position on the issue of whether the Senate should go a whole year without doing its job, but all we get from Congressman Heck are non-answers and Washington-speak," she said in a press release on Feb. 23. It’s quite a claim to say that literally every Republican senatorial candidate has taken a position on any issue, much less the politically-charged Supreme Court vacancy, so we decided to look into it. Journalists at the New York Times and liberal websites Think Progress and Daily Kos have tried to chart out where individual Senate Republicans stand on the issue of approving a nominee either now or under the next president. But those lists are mostly focused on the positions of sitting senators, and don’t include Senate hopefuls like Heck. So we put together a more complete list of what candidates and incumbent senators up for re-election in 2016 have said about the court vacancy using candidates listed in political scientist Larry Sabato’s "Crystal Ball." We found several who haven’t addressed the issue at all. In Maryland, for example, at least 14 candidates have filed as Republicans to run for the open Senate seat currently held by Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski. Only a handful of the candidates have functioning websites, and we could only find two candidates — Mark McNicholas and Chrysovalantis Kefalas — who even addressed the vacancy issue. It’s a similar case in Colorado, with 12 Republicans vying to take on incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet. Candidates there are all over the map, including some like state Sen. Tim Neville who have taken a similarly neutral or otherwise vague position. "As far as the schedule is concerned, the U.S. Senate is going to have the final say on who gets approved," he said to the Aurora Sentinel. "So whether it happens now or after the next election, the Republican Senate majority needs to stand strong and only confirm a nominee that will stand firm in defense of the Constitution." Duf Sundheim, a California Republican running a long-shot Senate bid, issued a similarly vague statement. "Whether they approve or reject a nominee is a decision that should be made by each senator," he said. "But they should do so with the highest level of veracity and honor." In total, we found at least 15 candidates who issued vague statements not specifically spelling out what they believe the Senate should do regarding the court vacancy, and many more who didn’t announce any position on their website or social media accounts. It’s fair to point out that many of the listed candidates are, to put it generously, running grassroots campaigns with little money and little hope of ending up in office. Zukowski issued a backtracking statement to PolitiFact saying, "All serious GOP Senate candidates have made it clear where they stand on the GOP's refusal to do its job." But the party is wrong in saying that the entire field of Republican Senate candidates have announced a clear stance on the issue, and in declaring that Heck stands alone in taking a guarded position on the vacancy. Our ruling The Nevada Democratic Party says that "every Republican Senate candidate" has announced their position on the Supreme Court vacancy, except for Heck. Our research shows that’s not the case. There are more than a dozen candidates, at least, who issued similarly neutral statements, and even more who haven’t addressed the issue at all. We rate the claim as False.	None	Nevada State Democratic Party	None	None	None	2016-03-03T18:12:53	2016-02-23	['None']
pomt-12452	Says if the AHCA replaces Obamacare it will "significantly reduce insurance premiums in" North Carolina.	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/may/10/ted-budd/what-will-happen-north-carolina-premiums-if-ahca-r/	One of the Republicans key to the American Health Care Act’s passage was North Carolina Rep. Ted Budd, who had said in March he would oppose the bill but in May ended up voting for an amended version of it. He was one of about three dozen Republicans who flipped from a No to a Yes, according to a Washington Post tally. The bill needed 216 votes to pass and squeaked by with 217. "Ultimately, the legislative process is a human process with all the flaws that entails," Budd said, explaining why he supported the AHCA. "The results of that process are never perfect, and this bill isn’t either. What I believe it will do is significantly reduce insurance premiums in our state, and help put the individual insurance marketplace on a more sound financial footing." The claim that the AHCA will "significantly reduce insurance premiums" in North Carolina stuck out to us. Budd clarified in an email that he was talking about premiums for people who don’t buy health insurance through work. So we kept our research focused on non-employer coverage. Half a million North Carolinians buy their health insurance on the individual market. A general summary For people who get health insurance on their own, experts agree that premiums nationwide would likely rise in the short-term but decrease in the long-term if the AHCA replaces the Affordable Care Act. So from that birds-eye view, Budd’s claim could be called right or wrong. PolitiFact previously ruled Half True a claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan that "the American Health Care Act will lower premiums." We asked Budd for proof about his claim that focused on North Carolina; he responded that national factors will apply to North Carolina as well. "Reducing premiums by increasing flexibility will in turn provide the incentive for young and healthy people to re-enter the insurance market, making the insurance pool as a whole healthier," he said. "A healthier pool is more cost effective and sustainable." He’s right that healthier pools are cheaper for everyone. But unfortunately for his argument, the AHCA is expected to do the exact opposite of what he described, at least in the beginning. Short term vs. long term By 2026, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in March, 24 million people are expected to drop their health insurance if the AHCA passes. The AHCA was amended since then, but there’s no new CBO analysis yet. First, healthy people who don’t need coverage will drop it because the AHCA would get rid of Obamacare’s penalties for being uninsured. As they leave, the CBO found, premiums will rise and millions more will drop their health insurance as it becomes unaffordable. And in those next few years, North Carolinians on the individual marketplace would be worse-off than people in every other state but Alaska, according to a study by the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, based on CBO data. North Carolinians would face an average $5,900 premium hike, as we found in a previous fact-check of Democratic N.C. Rep. David Price. As insurance becomes less affordable, that’s where Budd’s explanation about healthier people re-entering the market fits in. "Over the long run premiums would go down as expensive-to-cover people (primarily older buyers) are priced out of the market," Duke University health care researchers David Anderson wrote in an email. By 2026, the CBO estimated, premiums would be 10 percent lower under the AHCA than under Obamacare. Not apples-to-apples There are more caveats to Budd’s claim. One is that North Carolina might not just be an outlier in the short-term, but also the long-term. "North Carolina is an expensive state with high premiums," Anderson said, due in part to its unusually large rural population. But right now there’s no way to know exactly what might happen to premiums by 2026 in North Carolina if the AHCA passes – either for us or for Budd – because no nonpartisan analysis at the state level goes that far into the future. Budd might well end up being right, but he has no evidence. In general, Anderson said, young people and wealthy people will likely end up paying less while poor people and older people will either have to pay more or stop being insured. It’s also impossible to gauge a last-minute change to the AHCA, to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing conditions more than Obamacare would allow. The House passed the bill before the CBO could analyze the financial impact it would have. For more on that procedural oddity, see PolitiFact’s "Full Flop" ruling for House Speaker Paul Ryan. Another caveat is that long-term cost savings will only materialize if people accept plans with fewer options, since the AHCA would allow insurers to offer less coverage than Obamacare. The Brookings Institution found that if people want to keep their same level of coverage, in 2026 premiums would actually be 13 percent higher under the AHCA – not 10 percent lower. The final caveat is that even people with lower premiums might still pay more for health care. That’s because the AHCA would also allow insurers to charge higher deductibles. Premiums are what you pay to buy insurance, and deductibles are what you pay before that insurance kicks in. People who wouldn’t max out their deductibles under the ACA wouldn’t notice the difference, of course, but Anderson said people who would hit those caps under the ACA will certainly feel the pinch of having to pay even more money under the AHCA. "Increasing out-of-pocket maximums harms people who are already at the limit," he said. Our ruling North Carolina Republican Rep. Ted Budd defended his vote for the American Health Care Act, saying it will "significantly reduce insurance premiums in" North Carolina. In the short-term, insurance premiums on North Carolina’s individual market would actually increase. It’s not a small increase, either, but is rather expected to be the second-largest in the nation. Budd does have a point that premiums are expected to decrease in cost nationally a decade from now. People can quibble over whether an expected 10 percent decline is "significant," but it is a decline. However, that’s a national estimate. There’s no solid analysis yet into how North Carolina specifically might fare, a point against Budd. It's also just an average. Some people will see lower premiums, while others will see higher premiums – for many of them, high enough that experts believe they'll drop insurance entirely. And finally, even people with lower premiums might still pay more in the end, since their deductibles could be higher under the AHCA. Since Budd’s claim is partially accurate but missing some important context, we rate it Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Ted Budd	None	None	None	2017-05-10T14:03:12	2017-05-04	['None']
pomt-09502	"We have solved the problem. ... Scientists are now saying leave the nuclear waste where it is."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/22/harry-reid/reid-calls-nuclear-waste-issue-solved/	Nuclear power re-emerged as a hot-button issue earlier this month, when President Barack Obama announced that the Department of Energy was offering conditional loan guarantees worth $8.33 billion to support the construction and operation of two nuclear reactors in Burke, Ga. -- the first new nuclear generators to be built in nearly three decades. A return to nuclear power means new questions about the nation's long-term strategy for handling the nuclear waste created by electricity generation. Today, much of the nuclear waste produced by the electricity industry is stored where it was generated. But for years, the federal government has been planning to construct a single long-term storage facility where all of that waste can be consolidated. That site was to be at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. But the project has faced numerous technical, bureaucratic and political obstacles, and Obama made clear by the funding priorities in his fiscal year 2010 and 2011 budgets that the Yucca Mountain facility won't be the solution during his presidency. For many years, one of Yucca Mountain's most prominent -- and influential -- opponents has been Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat. In a Feb. 19, 2010, television interview with Reid, Las Vegas-based political analyst Jon Ralston asked the senator about what the administration's interest in promoting new nuclear plants means for nuclear waste generally and Yucca Mountain specifically. "What about the issue of everyone being so gung-ho now on nuclear power, including the president, when you still have not solved the waste problem?" Ralston asked the senator. Reid responded, "That's where you're wrong -- we have solved the problem." Ralston interjected, "It's sitting around at all these sites." Reid replied, "Scientists are now saying leave the nuclear waste where it is, in deep ground storage. And when I say deep ground, (I mean) 10 feet underground. The new nuclear power plants are going to be built, and it's terrific that the president stepped forward on this. I'm not against nuclear power. I'm against bringing nuclear waste to Nevada. Scientists say leave it where it is. That's what we have to do." We acknowledge that there's a raging political debate about what to do with nuclear waste. But in checking on Reid's statement, we were interested in whether there's a technical consensus about the most promising approach. We asked an array of nuclear waste experts -- in the nuclear power industry, in academia and in nuclear-skeptical nonprofit groups -- whether they thought that scientists generally agreed with Reid that the best way to store nuclear waste is at the scattered sites where it is produced. Reid is correct that most nuclear scientists -- as well as the federal agency responsible for the industry, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -- agree that storing nuclear waste on-site at a power plant or an off-site facility can be safe for 100 years. It's called "dry cask storage." According to the NRC, the system allows spent fuel -- a type of radioactive waste produced in the electricity-generation process -- that has already been cooled in water for at least one year to be surrounded by inert gas inside a container called a cask. In a "confidence decision" first made in 1990 and reaffirmed in 1999, the NRC declared dry casks to be safe for the storage of spent fuels for at least 100 years. As recently as May 12, 2009, NRC chairman Dale E. Klein stated that using the dry cask storage system, "spent fuel can be safely and securely stored on site, without significant environmental impact, for at least 100 years." Some industry watchdogs argue that the NRC's regulations should be more stringent, and there is professional disagreement on some of the technical issues of how, and for how long, dry-cask storage should be implemented. But experts we spoke to said that Reid is generally correct that dry-cask storage is a credible solution that can work effectively for many decades. But the senator did not bring up a key qualifier -- that dry-cask storage is not typically envisioned as a long-term solution. While 100 years may seem like a long time to most people, in the life of radioactive decay it is but a blink in time. Most scientists agree that, over the longer term, one of two possible courses should be considered -- deep-geologic repositories, such as Yucca Mountain, or reprocessing, a technique that essentially recycles spent fuel into new material that can be used for power generation and other uses. The industry, for one, sees far broader support for the geologic solution than for Reid's approach. "The scientific consensus since 1957 is that the best place for high-level radioactive waste, whether in the form of glass logs from reprocessing or used fuel, is deep geologic disposal," said Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry trade group. "Even scientists, and there are only a few, who don’t like Yucca Mountain as a disposal site agree with the need for deep geologic disposal. No scientist we have ever heard of thinks that on-site storage at reactor sites is the best place for this material in the long run." Edwin Lyman is a physicist and senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog group that often crosses swords with the Nuclear Energy Institute. But asked about Reid's comment, Lyman agreed with the industry group, saying he is "unaware of any significant support in the technical community for leaving spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites indefinitely. There is a broad consensus that interim storage of spent fuel in dry casks can be managed at reactor sites for at least several decades." Lyman, like the Nuclear Energy Institute, says that deep-geologic storage eases security worries. Today, the security of on-site storage locations is relatively easy, since the adjoining nuclear generators have to be protected from intruders anyway. That becomes harder once a plant is decommissioned after a few decades of use. "In the long run, institutional control over these sites cannot be assured," he said. "Therefore, spent fuel, which will remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years, will need to be disposed of in a deep geologic repository that in theory is able to isolate the waste from the biosphere without the need for active controls." Other experts we spoke to agreed with Reid that a Yucca Mountain repository isn't a good answer -- but not even they join the senator in advocating scatter-site storage. John Poston Sr., a nuclear engineer at Texas A&M University, said he favors reprocessing rather than using geologic storage, noting that it reduces the amount of waste that needs to be stored. (For the record, Reid told Ralston that he opposes reprocessing as well. "How do you get the stuff to reprocess? Does it just show up one morning? ... You have to bring it there. ... We don't want to haul through here 77,000 tons from around the country.") Ultimately, our sources agreed, Reid jumps to an unjustifiable conclusion. "I would say he's wrong in saying 'we have solved the problem,' " said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear policy specialist at Harvard University. Dry casks are "not a really long-term solution, and it ultimately needs to go underground." They also agreed that Reid introduced a puzzling concept into his comments -- the idea that dry-cask storage typically occurs underground. In fact, in most cases today, the casks are stored above ground. "The casks emit heat from their surface, produced by the radioactive decay of the material inside," said Clifford E. Singer, a professor of nuclear, plasma and radiological engineering at the University of Illinois. "They can be located below grade but thus still need air circulating around them for many years, so 10 feet underground is possible but not the same as 'buried.'" Jon Summers, a spokesman for Reid, defended the senator's statement. He argued that the dangers of transporting radiological materials around the United States outweigh the risks of keeping them where they are. He added that since the spent fuel needs to cool before being transported, these sites need to have technical and security infrastructure in place anyway. And he said that having a cushion of 100 years "buys time" to improve the technology to deal with radioactive waste. "Sen. Reid agrees that dry-cask storage is not the permanent solution," which is why he supported creating a blue-ribbon commission to come up with recommendations for permanent disposal, Summers said. He added, though, that "dry-cask storage is already securing waste at over half of the nation’s nuclear sites." But even if you accept that Reid was merely advocating dry-cask storage as something less than a permanent solution -- an interpretation we did not make when saw the interview -- Reid's comment suggests a finality on this debate that simply isn't there. Using the word "solved" to describe a hard-fought and highly technical debate strikes us as inadvisable. So we rate his statement False.

pomt-00417	Studies are showing California’s wildfires "are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/aug/29/kevin-mccarthy/wildfires-or-cars-which-produces-more-emissions/	Wildfires have ravaged California again this year, destroying hundreds of homes and killing six firefighters, as well as several residents. This year also produced the largest single fire in California’s history, the Ranch Fire, which had burned more than 400,000 acres and spread across four counties near the Mendocino National Forest as of late August. Smoke up and down the state, for days at a time, has blanketed metro areas miles from the fires, raising worries about air quality and pollution. The wildfires have led some, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, to claim the blazes are spewing out more pollution than the state’s millions of vehicles. "I have a real concern about air quality because of where I come from," McCarthy, a Republican who represents the southern San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, said during a speech in Sacramento on Aug. 15, 2018. "(We’re at the) bottom of all the mountains and we collect (air pollution) all the way from San Francisco." "What I have found, because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing," he added. SOURCE: Public Policy Institute of California Was McCarthy right? We decided to fact-check his wildfires-versus-cars comparison. Our research Sean Raffuse, an analyst at the UC Davis Air Quality Research Center, told us McCarthy’s statement is correct, but for only for one category of emissions — particulate matter. The claim is not true, however, for climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions, he said. Cars still produce far more of those. Particulate matter, or PM, is a mixture of microscopic particles and liquid droplets that, when inhaled, can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health problems. For months, officials have issued health warnings that particulate matter from the wildfires could trigger asthma attacks or aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases. Specifically, Raffuse said, the fires produce more PM 2.5 than all cars. PM 2.5 refers to particles two and one half microns or less in width, or about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair. "PM 2.5 emissions are greater than what we see from cars, and that’s typical, not just of California during the wildfire season," he said, "but even if you look overall at the nation for an entire year, there will be more emissions from particles from wildfires than there will be from motor vehicles." Clean combustion regulations, he said, are one reason vehicles produce fewer particulate matter than fires. Earlier this month, the Trump administration proposed rules that would ease vehicle emissions standards nationwide. The proposal would also challenge the right of states, California in particular, to set their own, more stringent tailpipe pollution standards. Greenhouse gas emissions Bill Stewart, a researcher at the UC Berkeley Center for Forestry, said there’s a key point missing from McCarthy’s statement. While fires emit more particulate matter, cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, he said. "Those are two important but different issues," Stewart said. Mike Kleeman, a UC Davis professor of environmental engineering, added that wildfires also emit some greenhouse gases. "But burned areas also regrow during which time they act as a net carbon sink. Assuming a burned area regrows completely over a time of decades, the net CO2 emissions should be low," Kleeman wrote in an email. "Wildfires are a problem," he added, "and we should be taking steps to reduce their frequency and intensity. But it isn't an ‘apples to apples’ comparison to an every-day source like cars." McCarthy’s response Asked for evidence supporting the claim, McCarthy’s spokesman pointed to an October 2017 NBC News story that examined the emissions produced by that year’s deadly Wine Country fires. The story had the misleading headline: "California Wildfires Emitted a Year's Worth of Car Pollution in Less Than a Week." It quoted Raffuse of UC Davis, who told NBC the fires had released the same amount of particulate matter as come from California vehicles in one year. He didn’t claim the fires had produced more of all types of emissions than cars. In the article, the researcher "pointed out cars pollute in other ways, too." Raffuse summed up the congressman’s statement saying it’s "partially correct but omits a key distinction." McCarthy’s spokesman did not cite any specific studies to support the claim. We reviewed several that described wildfire emissions as a growing concern, but did not say they produce more pollution overall compared with cars. One such report by the Sierra Nevada Conservancy in 2014 found that by the year 2085, emissions from wildfires are projected to be equal to the annual emissions of about one fifth of all of the cars currently registered in California. Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed "because of these fires, there are studies that are showing they are producing more emissions than all of our cars are doing." Wildfires produce more of one key pollutant, particulate matter, than cars, both in California and nationwide. But that’s all. McCarthy cherry-picked this one category and ignored the fact that cars produce far more greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, than fires. We rate McCarthy’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-10314	Barack Obama wants to "restore" the estate tax that George W. Bush "repealed."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/04/chain-email/bush-didnt-repeal-it-obama-would-expand-it/	A chain e-mail claims that Sen. Barack Obama intends to raise pretty much all your taxes, while Sen. John McCain will leave them alone. The problem is that most of the e-mail's detailed assertions are false. Here, we'll look at the e-mail's claims about Barack Obama and the estate tax, which it refers to as the inheritance tax. For an examination of the e-mail's other claims, read our full article here . The e-mail claims that President George W. Bush "repealed" the estate tax, and it now stands at 0 percent. Though Bush reduced the tax, he did not repeal it. Rather, under his 2001 tax cut package, the estate tax reduces every year and then goes away for just a single year — 2010 — before reverting back to higher rates. (See the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center on estate taxes for more details.) Currently, the estate tax generally applies only to estates worth more than $2-million (or $4-million for couples). Above those amounts, the tax rate tops out at 45 percent. Both Obama and McCain support renewing the current estate tax with a few changes. McCain proposes to increase the exemption to $5-million ($10-million for couples) and reduce the tax rate to 15 percent. Obama proposes to increase the exemption to $3.5-million ($7-million for couples) and leave the top rate at 45 percent. So the e-mail is wrong when it says McCain wants a "0 percent" estate tax and that Obama wants to "restore" it. We rule this statement False.

pomt-07485	"Foreign aid makes up about 1 percent of our entire budget."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-foreign-aid-makes-1-percent-us-b/	President Barack Obama’s April 13 speech on federal debt and spending contained plenty of interesting claims, and we’ll be checking those in the coming days. We wanted to start with with a remark the president made to back up his contention that politicians often focus their deficit-cutting rhetoric on hot-button programs that are just a small portion of the federal budget. Politicians in both parties, he said, "suggest that we can somehow close our entire deficit by eliminating things like foreign aid, even though foreign aid makes up about 1% of our entire budget." We wondered if foreign aid really makes up such a small portion of federal spending. In February, PolitiFact checked a claim by Ross Douthat, a columnist at The New York Times. Douthat said Israel and Egypt receive more foreign aid from Uncle Sam than any other nations. We rated that True, noting that if you exclude the spending on Afghanistan and Iraq, where military operations continue, Israel received $2.4 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, while Egypt got $1.5 billion. Those 2008 figures came from the U.S. Census 2011 Statistical Abstract. The United States spent a total $49.1 billion on foreign aid that year. According to the Treasury Department and historical tables on the federal budget, total federal spending was $2.98 trillion for the 2008 fiscal year. That means foreign aid made up 1.64 percent of budget. What about 2009? In that fiscal year, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the United States spent $44.9 billion, while overall government spending was $3.52 trillion. Foreign aid spending was 1.28 percent of the total budget. If you’re wondering who else is a major U.S. aid recipient, here’s the rest of the top 10 from 2008: Russia ($1.3 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), Tanzania ($1.1 billion), Ethiopia ($1 billion), Pakistan ($963 million), Colombia ($888 million), Jordan ($833 million), and Mozambique ($799 million). The totals reflect both economic and military aid. So Obama was almost exactly right in saying foreign aid consumes about 1 percent of the U.S. budget. In fiscal 2008 U.S. foreign aid spending of $49.1 billion made up 1.64 percent of total spending. The next year foreign aid spending was $44.9 billion, or 1.28 percent of the total budget. We rate the president’s statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-04-13T16:45:30	2011-04-13	['None']
pomt-08014	Georgia lawmakers fuel up for the session by feasting on "wild" hogs.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/11/new-georgia-encyclopedia/georgia-politicos-pork-out-wild-pig-begin-each-leg/	There are a lot of peculiar political rituals we could talk about here at PolitiFact Georgia. But few are more colorful than the pre-legislative feast laid out for the Georgia Legislature every year for the past five decades. It takes place at the old train depot near Underground Atlanta and is attended by hundreds of folks -- lawmakers, the governor, state officials, reporters, lobbyists and just about anybody else who can score a ticket. "Since 1962 the Georgia General Assembly has opened its new legislative session each January with the 'Wild Hog Supper,' at which legislators enjoy such state delicacies as barbecued wild pig and Brunswick stew," notes the New Georgia Encyclopedia in its extensive entry on hogs in Georgia history. No doubt about the Legislature kicking off the year with a "Wild Hog" feast. But in an age of "cloud computing" and factory farms, are they REALLY still serving "wild" pigs, the intrepid fact-diggers at PolitiFact Georgia wondered? To get to the answer, PolitiFact trekked back into the legendary swamps of south-central Georgia. Bob Addison, who runs Addison Wild Boar Hunting near Abbeville, and whose family and community still supply the victuals for the Wild Hog feast, knows the history as well as anyone. He's lived it most of his life. The story begins with Addison's late father, E.C. "Boo" Addison, who for most of his 80 years pursued a cunning and dangerous animal that has roamed the wilds of south-central Georgia since the first Europeans arrived. Early settlers brought domestic livestock into the area and often let their hogs and cattle roam free. Some of the pigs became wild, and later were crossbred with a much larger Russian boar to produce the wild hogs that now populate the swamps. Back in the late 1950s, "Boo" Addison was camping in a Dodge County swamp with Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Phil Campbell and state House Speaker George L. Smith when the idea of a legislative hog supper took root. Thousands of feral hogs still roam those river-bottom woodlands. "They got some hogs and they barbecued 'em down in the swamp," Bob Addison said. "George L. said to Phil, 'This is mighty good eatin'. It's a shame the legislators in Atlanta couldn't have a chance to get some of this good food.' And Daddy said, 'I'll furnish the hogs.' Well, they went back to Atlanta and decided that the Sunday before the Legislature opened, they'd have this supper. And it's been happening ever since." Addison said the first supper took place at the Henry Grady Hotel -- since demolished -- and was attended by about 300 people. The event moved to its current location about a decade ago and now attracts more than 1,000 guests. Over the years, the Wild Hog Supper came to define the Legislature's return to the Capitol. About 15 years ago, organizers began issuing tickets to control the crowd. "Busloads of people would pull up, and we had no idea who they were," said former Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin. One thing that hasn't changed much over the years is the entree. The hogs that end up on dinner plates begin life in litters of up to 14 born deep in the dark undergrowth of Addison's swamp. Coyotes and other predators quickly thin their ranks. The hogs that survive eat just about anything that won't eat them -- acorns, roots, even snakes and small animals. Addison supplements their diet with grain, peanut shells and barrels of discarded candy from a nearby factory. The male hogs, the boars, are the wildest. They average 250 pounds but can tip the scales at 600. Their razor-sharp tusk can rip a man or dog to shreds. "No matter how young they are, boars have a strong taste," said Bob Addison's wife, Jo Ann. "We don't use boars for the Wild Hog Supper." The Addisons use only sweeter-tasting female hogs for the legislative shindig. The hogs -- very wild indeed as it turns out -- are captured in large "Jurassic Park"-looking cages several weeks before the supper. They are penned up and fattened on grain before they are slaughtered. "It sort of tenders them up a bit," said Jo Ann Addison. She said they used 20 wild hogs for this year's supper, which attracted a packed house even as a major snow and ice storm moved into metro Atlanta. It turns out the hogs at the 49th annual Wild Hog Supper were indeed wild -- these critters never see a pen until they are captured. We rate this one True. And in case you're still reading, we're including a bonus. Below you will find Bob Addison's recipe for cooking a wild hog -- just in case you ever need it: Prepare oak coals two hours before cooking begins in the evening. Allow the coals to form a thin dusting of ash. Place the hog carcasses on metal racks 18 inches above the coals in special covered pits in the ground. Put the skin side up. Keep the pit temperature about 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Cook for eight hours. Just after sunrise, turn the meat. "That boils the grease back up through the meat as a natural tenderizer." Cook for a few more hours until the ribs separate from the meat. Total cooking time --- 12 hours. Serve with barbecue sauce and enjoy.

pomt-14629	On opposing citizenship for illegal immigrants	half flip	/florida/statements/2016/jan/29/marco-rubio/did-marco-rubio-flip-flip-amnesty/	Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Marco Rubio to explain what sounded like different positions on granting legal status to people living in the country illegally, often described as amnesty, during the Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 28. "When you ran for Senate in 2010, you made clear that you opposed legalization and citizenship for illegal immigrants," Kelly said during the Republican debate in Des Moines on Jan. 28. "You promised repeatedly that you would oppose it as a U.S. senator as well." She then played a series of video clips in which he spoke against "amnesty" in the past. Kelly then asked Rubio, "Within two years of getting elected, you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven't you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?" Rubio countered: "No, because if you look at the quote, and it's very specific. And, it says blanket amnesty, I do not support blanket amnesty … ." The back and forth between Rubio and Kelly continued. We decided to put Rubio’s past statements on amnesty on our Flip-O-Meter, which measures to what extent -- if any -- a politician has flipped on an issue. We don’t make a judgment on the change of position, only whether the candidate actually changed position or not. Rubio’s statements about amnesty in 2010 race Immigration reform was a hot topic in the 2010 Florida Senate race when Rubio ran against Charlie Crist, who ultimately ran as an independent, and Democrat Kendrick Meek. The conservative Shark Tank blogger, Javier Manjarres, asked Rubio in 2009: "Are you pro-amnesty for illegal immigration?" "No, no. Never have been. In fact, I'm strongly against amnesty for a number of different reasons. The first is, I always use the example of the speed limit. If you say the speed limit is 70, but you don’t ticket people until they reach 80, well then the speed limit is really 80, it’s not 70. Amnesty is the same thing. The most important thing we need to do is enforce our existing laws. We have existing immigration laws that are not being adequately enforced. Nothing will make it harder to enforce your existing laws if you reward people who broke them." Rubio also said: "I will never support – never have and never will support – any effort to grant blanket, legalization, amnesty to folks who have entered or stayed in this country illegally." In October 2009, Rubio said in an interview on WSRE in Pensacola: "You cannot grant amnesty. If you grant amnesty, you will send a message that all you have to do is come into America illegally, stay here long enough, and we will let you stay. No. 2, you will destroy any hopes you have of having a legal immigration system that works. If the American people see us grant amnesty, they will never again believe in legal immigration, they will never again support it. And that’s wrong for our country, bad for our future." "In fact in ’86 when Reagan created an amnesty program, about 3 million people were granted amnesty. The result was that you had a bunch of people standing in line to enter legally who all claimed to be illegal because it was easier to get through the amnesty program. So we can’t have amnesty. "And I think if you have a guest worker program in place that functions, the illegal folks that are here now will go back home through attrition." In a Senate debate on Univision in September 2010, Rubio spoke against the DREAM Act, which Senate Democrats planned to debate the following week. Dreamers are young people brought to the United States illegally as children. "What they're offering now is a bill that would in essence grant amnesty to 2 million people," Rubio said. "It’s a cynical way to play politics with the lives of real people . . . This is what always happens with Hispanic voters in this country, they manipulate them come election time." (The DREAM Act didn’t pass. In 2012, President Barack Obama announced Deferred Status for Childhood Arrivals to give temporary status, without a path to citizenship.) In an October 2010 debate, CNN’s Candy Crowley asked Rubio what he would do with the nation's 12 million undocumented immigrants: Rubio replied: "Well, first, I don't believe we can grant amnesty, because I think it's unfair to the people who have entered this country legally. And I also think it will undermine ... Crowley: "So you would send them all out of the country?" Rubio: "Well, it's not that simple. We all know -- I've never advocated that we round people up. I don't know anyone who is seriously talking about that. What I have said needs to have happen is we have to have a legal immigration system that functions." Later in the debate, Rubio said: "First of all, (an) earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It's what they call it. And the reality of it is this: This has to do with the bottom line that America cannot be the only country in the world that does not enforce its immigration laws. "It is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally and knowingly did so. And all I'm saying is that if you do that ... you will never have a legal immigration system that works. No one is going to follow the law if there is an easier way to do it." So in 2010, Rubio spoke against amnesty. In the CNN debate, Rubio opposed amnesty and linked it to an earned path to citizenship. This is a contrast to how he would later talk about the 2013 bill. What Rubio said about amnesty in 2011 and 2012 In May 2011, Rubio told Politico with respect to the DREAM Act, the solution "can't be part of some broader effort to grant blanket amnesty." "I've said repeatedly I want to help these kids. I think these were kids who were brought to this country by their parents when they were very young; they were high academic achievers and want to go to college and contribute to America's future or serve in the armed forces," Rubio said. "And I think helping them would be good for America. I do want to help them; I just don't think the DREAM Act is the right or best way to do it." What Rubio said about amnesty in 2013 While a senator, Rubio co-authored the Gang of Eight bill in 2013 that included a pathway to citizenship. Ahead of the release of the bill, Rubio said that the proposal "is not amnesty." Rubio argued that the legislation outlining a 13-year pathway to legal status and eventually citizenship is not amnesty. He was right that the bill does not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants. The bill mandated fines, background checks and waiting periods, and it was tougher than its 1986 predecessor. But it also offered a measure of clemency to those immigrants, who would not be required to return to their home countries. We rated his statement that the proposal "is not amnesty" Half True. In April 2013, Rubio went on Meet the Press to defend the bill. Host David Gregory asked Rubio about his past and current positions on amnesty: Gregory: "Three years ago in a debate you were clear on this. You said, ‘To earn a pathway to citizenship, you have to leave this country if you are here illegally -- go back home. And then you could come back in.’ You said an earned pathway was amnesty. Yet you've changed your mind here -- why?" Rubio: "Well, first of all, what I said throughout my campaign was that I was against a blanket amnesty, and this is not blanket amnesty. On the contrary, this is not blanket anything. And, secondly, it's not amnesty because you pay serious consequences for having violated the law. "Third, we need to understand the existing law. The existing law does not prohibit someone -- the law today does not prohibit someone who violated the immigration laws from getting a green card. It simply says you have to leave the United States, and you have to wait 10 years." He then recapped the provisions of the bill that include the waiting period. The bill never reached a vote in the House and died. Rubio now favors a piecemeal approach rather than one comprehensive bill. Our rating Rubio opposed amnesty while running for Senate in 2010. He flatly said that he would oppose granting "blanket, legalization, amnesty" in an interview with a conservative blogger. In a CNN debate that year, he again opposed amnesty and linked it to a path to citizenship when he said that an "earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty" and that it would be unfair to "create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally and knowingly did so." But in 2013, he was one of eight authors of a Senate bill that included a path to citizenship and declared that it was not amnesty. Rubio can argue that the bill -- which died in the House -- was not "blanket amnesty," because it included significant hurdles including fines and a waiting period. That’s a partial change of position, so we rate it a Half Flip.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-01-29T00:13:49	2016-01-28	['None']
pomt-07234	Says that PolitiFact Ohio confirms that Betty Sutton "maxed out federal debt"	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/we-said-what-nrcc-claims-politifact-ohio-confirmed/	Is up down? Is red blue? Is rain the same as sunshine? In Washington, it is, and if it isn’t, someone will insist it is anyway. So PolitiFact Ohio is amused -- and not entirely surprised -- that when we rated a claim "Barely True," a political organization quickly sent out an e-mail to the press crowing that we had confirmed something that we absolutely did not confirm. On Tuesday, May 31, we ruled that a claim by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), attacking Democratic congresswoman Betty Sutton, was Barely True. The claim was that Sutton and her Democratic colleagues ran up the nation’s credit card with unsustainable and irresponsible spending and "now their credit card is maxed out." In other words, the nation’s federal debt problem was her fault. While Sutton certainly voted for various spending bills, as we noted, our reporting also found that wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, President George W. Bush’s tax cuts (extended under President Barack Obama) and the recession played roles in the debt, too. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that "Bush-era tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars — including their associated interest costs — account for almost half of the projected public debt in 2019 (measured as a share of the economy) if we continue current policies." But an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation said such an analysis "fails basic statistics" because it doesn’t look at Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and discretionary spending. In other words, you can’t just blame the programs and decisions you don’t like or find convenient and ignore all others. That cherry-picking criticism was apt for the claim about Sutton. As we noted, Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling seven times under Bush, and three times under Obama. So yes, Sutton voted for spending bills, as detailed by NRCC spokesman Tory Mazzola, one of the sources with whom we checked while researching this matter. But you cannot ignore the roles that the wars, tax cuts and the struggling economy also played in the nation’s debt. Those were critical facts ignored by the NRCC claim that led to the Truth-O-Meter rating of Barely True. Fast-forward to 9:51 a.m. today (June 1, 2011).That’s when Mazzola sent out this e-mail news release: "PolitiFact Confirms Sutton ‘Maxed Out Federal Debt’ As She Ducks For Political Cover." In the text of his message, Mazzola wrote: "POLITIFACT OHIO SAYS TRUE: ‘Betty Sutton and Her Fellow Democrats Went On A Spending Spree And Now Their Credit Card Is Maxed Out.’ For backup, Mazzola noted the sections of our fact-checking in which we quoted or paraphrased him. He ignored everything else. We sent him an e-mail this morning (June 1) noting our puzzlement, and he replied. "By ruling it ‘true,’ albeit barely, you determined that the Democrats' responses were not believable, not credible, or false at least a degree more than ours were true," he said. We could parse, say up is down, left is right, or that it’s snowing in Washington (never mind the heat wave), but Mazzola’s logic on this just won’t fly -- even inside the Beltway. The Truth-O-Meter defines Barely True this way: The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That description fits the NRCC’s criticism of Sutton. The Truth-O-Meter has other ratings available, of course, including its lowest, Pants on Fire. The definition? "The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim." One other way to put it is: We said what? Both fit the NRCC’s characterization perfectly.

pomt-08650	Taxpayers pay $18,000 a month for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/15/john-dennis/gop-rival-says-taxpayers-pay-18000month-nancy-pelo/	What do you do when you're a Republican running an uphill, some would say quixotic, campaign against Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in historically liberal San Francisco? Trailing badly in the polls, John Dennis appears to be trying to raise his profile via the viral campaign video route. Dennis has introduced a Wizard of Oz-themed ad, with Pelosi, of course, cast in the role of the Wicked Witch of the West. "I will save you from those evil Republicans," the Pelosi character cackles. "But first, pay $18,000 a month for my downtown office." She then talks about running up the debt and summons her "monkeys" (sporting IRS tags) "to make you pay for it all." Cue Dennis. "Step back everyone," says Dennis, appearing in the frame. He pours a bucket of water (labeled "Freedom" -- we're not making this up) and melts the witch. Hokey? You bet. But with 500,000 hits in its first few days online, we'd say, mission accomplished. None of the actors is likely to get much Oscar buzz, but we're not here to review the ad's artistic merits. We'll stick to a fact-check of the claim that taxpayers are on the hook for $18,000 a month for Pelosi's downtown San Francisco district office. The rent for Pelosi's district office is actually $18,736 a month, as first reported in June 2010 in a Roll Call analysis of a database assembled by the Sunlight Foundation. Pelosi moved into the 3,075 square foot space in the new, 18-story federal building in downtown San Francisco in the fall of 2009. It was a significant upgrade, more than quadrupling the rent she paid for her previous district office, and is nearly double the next-highest rental paid by a member of the House. According to the Roll Call analysis, the next highest monthly office rent, $10,600, belongs to Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose district office is in a federal building in Manhattan. Democratic Reps. Jose Serrano (Bronx, N.Y.), Doris Matsui (Sacramento) Stephen Lynch (Boston) and Diane Watson (Los Angeles) all pay $9,000 to $10,000 a month for district offices. This rental data comes courtesy of Pelosi, who allowed the release of the House's quarterly Statement of Disbursements online for the first time in November 2009. Drew Hammill, Pelosi's press secretary, said the decision to move last fall was justified because after 20 years, "the old office was no longer able to meet the needs of San Franciscans in the existing space and the new office will expand office size by nearly a third, allowing better service for San Francisco constituents." The office is more centrally located, Hammill said, allowing constituents better access via public transportation. Better security was also a priority, he said. "In the role as speaker of the House, the new federal building offers enhanced security features, a major factor in the decision to move offices," Hammill said. "This move did not come without additional expense," Hammill said. "As every San Franciscan knows, the city is one of the most densely populated areas in the county and, of course, office space rents are among the highest, on average, in the country." Hammill also noted that the rent is being paid back to the federal government, which owns the building, and that Pelosi pays the same cost per square foot as any other federal agency that is a tenant of the building. By way of context, Roll Call reporter Paul Singer noted in his report that serving as speaker carries additional cost and that previous speakers have paid substantially more for their district offices than other nearby members of Congress. One other piece of context is warranted. The expense for district office rent is paid out of set amount allotted to members called the Members' Representational Allowances (which typically range from about $1.4 million to $1.7 million for each office). Out of this account, members pay for their staff, travel, office rent, office art, flowers, bottles of water etc. The amount of the allowance varies based on factors such as the distance of a member's district to D.C. and the relative cost of office space in the member's home district. Pelosi's allowance is higher due to the travel distance to California and the high rents charged in San Francisco. In addition, because of the additional responsibilities, the speaker gets a higher allowance. Members can decide for themselves how to spend their allowances. And Pelosi did not exceed hers. So one could argue that while Pelosi decided to prioritize spending for her office space, it didn't cost taxpayers any more, that she simply had less to spend on other things. Members can give back the unused part of their allowance, but in practice, very few ever do. They simply find other ways to spend it. We're not going to weigh in on whether Pelosi's rent is justified. But the ad says the American public pays $18,000 a month for Pelosi's district office in downtown San Francisco, and its $18,736. We rate Dennis' ad corny, but True.	None	John Dennis	None	None	None	2010-09-15T10:30:13	2010-09-14	['Nancy_Pelosi', 'San_Francisco']
pomt-05247	Ted Cruz "helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/jun/01/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-ted-cruz-helps-run-two-nationa/	David Dewhurst, seeking the Republican U.S. Senate nomination, declared before his party's May 2012 primary that opponent Ted Cruz helps steer two groups seeking amnesty for illegal immigrants. Dewhurst, who faces Cruz in a July 31, 2012, runoff, leveled the claim in a radio ad his campaign released May 24, 2012, five days before the primary. In the stop, two women discuss Cruz's candidacy and one says: "Cruz helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants." "Amnesty groups? Ted Cruz?" the other woman replies. "Yup," woman No. 1 says. "He’s on their boards." The specter of Cruz, the state’s former solicitor-general, leading groups that back amnesty runs counter to a March 5, 2012, commentary by Peggy Fikac of the Hearst Newspapers Austin bureau pointed out by Cruz's campaign in response to Dewhurst's ad. Fikac wrote: "While (Cruz) often tells the story of his father fleeing Cuban oppression and celebrates legal immigration, he's a hard-liner on border security and illegal immigration. He opposes amnesty. ..." We wondered if Dewhurst, the Texas lieutenant governor, accurately captured Cruz's amnesty activism. An anti-Cruz website set up by Dewhurst’s campaign says Cruz sits on the boards of the Hispanic Alliance for Prosperity Institute and the Hispanic Leadership Fund, the implication being that both groups are leading the push for amnesty. About amnesty: As PolitiFact noted in a December 2, 2011, article, Merriam Webster defines amnesty as "the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals." With respect to illegal immigrants, the historical standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. That law enabled illegal residents to become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in the United States by Jan. 1, 1982, and met other minimal requirements. It was widely described as an "amnesty" program. But amnesty can be defined differently depending on one’s view of immigration policy. Advocates for more legal immigration often maintain that amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria. Those who oppose additional immigration define amnesty more broadly. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, previously told PolitiFact: "Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty." To gauge Dewhurst’s claim, we sought details about the mentioned groups and Cruz’s connections. Nexis searches for news stories on the groups calling for amnesty came up empty. But Dewhurst campaign spokesman Matt Hirsch pointed us to the HAP Institute website, which lists Cruz as among about 35 members of its board of advisors. When we peeked, the group also had posted this statement: "The HAP Institute does not support amnesty nor have we in the past. We seek a productive dialogue from our leaders that will promote free market principles." Then again, Hirsch pointed out, the institute in 2011 said it was reasonable for Texas to establish a system enabling illegal immigrants to work legally in the state as proposed by state Rep. Paul Workman, R-Austin. An April 6, 2011, blog post by the institute urged readers to take action as a Texas House committee held a hearing on Workman’s proposal. Generally, the institute post says, "a comprehensive state reform bill would need to address three pillars – tougher enforcement, a guest worker program, fines and worker permits – in order to be beneficial. Several states have passed reform bills and the most recent bill passed in Utah contains these elements. Texas in in dire need of comprehensive immigration reform legislation and efforts to pass bills to address these elements must be given a chance." We recently reviewed Workman’s proposal in rating Half True a claim by Workman’s 2012 Republican primary challenger, Ryan Downton, that Workman’s legislation provided amnesty for illegal immigrants. House Bill 2886 would have enabled illegal residents paying a fee and clearing a background check to receive state-issued cards enabling them to work in Texas for eight years at a time. That seems a kind of forgiveness some would consider amnesty. However, the proposal does not go as far as the 1986 federal act, which enabled immigrants to become legal residents for all purposes, not just to work for a period in one state. Significantly, that law put beneficiaries on paths to citizenship; Workman’s proposal would not. An institute representative, Suzanne Bellsnyder of Austin, registered in favor of Workman’s proposal, according to a witness list for a hearing held by the House Committee on State Affairs on April 6, 2011. Bellsnyder, a consultant to the institute, which has offices in Austin and Washington, told us by telephone that the group, whose founding members include Cruz, earlier backed President George W. Bush’s 2004 call for immigration reform. Cruz was an adviser in Bush’s 2000 campaign and worked for federal agencies while Bush was president. Bush outlined an approach, which did not pass into law, that included a temporary worker program for newcomers and for immigrants already living illegally in the country, according to a summary by the Migration Policy Institute. Beneficiaries would have had to apply for renewable three-year temporary visas, the summary says, while unauthorized immigrants applying from within the United States would be required to pay a fee and prove they were already employed. Applicants from other countries would have to show they had a job offer from an American employer. Bellsnyder said: "We like guest-worker programs and we want to have a positive debate and momentum on these issues and at some level, a path to citizenship," though she cautioned any endorsement of a plan would depend on its provisions. "It’s not black and white." She said the group -- whose education arm, the Hispanic Alliance for Progress, hosted Dewhurst as a speaker at a March 31, 2005, Austin event -- has never been for amnesty, which she defined as letting an offense pass without punishment. Any required payment, she said, would be punishment. Contrary to Dewhurst’s backup information, Cruz is not a board member with the non-partisan Hispanic Leadership Fund, according to a list on the 4-year-old group’s website. The group’s president, Mario Lopez, told us by phone that he briefed Cruz about the group’s interest in an immigration system that works a couple years ago, though Cruz has not served on its board. Mindful that since 1986, Congress has not approved a rewrite of immigration laws that might be interpreted as amnesty, we queried national experts and activists on whether the HAP Institute ranks among leading advocates for amnesty, as Dewhurst says. Negative, they uniformly said. Donald Kerwin, executive director of the New York-based Center for Migration Studies, told us by phone there has been no recent national push for what he would consider amnesty, meaning forgiveness without hurdles. Kerwin, who wrote a December 2010 report sketching out the history of U.S. immigration law, further said that business, labor and civil rights groups are most associated with attempts to establish a way for a share of illegal residents to attain legal residency. Conversely, he said, the HAP Institute has not been a leading advocate. Similarly, Tamar Jacoby of Washington-based ImmigrationWorks USA, which says it seeks laws bringing the country's legal intake of foreign workers in line with labor needs, said the institute has not been a leading advocate on immigration issues, including amnesty. Chris Chmielenski of NumbersUSA, which favors reductions in immigration and also tries to track Senate candidate positions on immigration, replied to our inquiry with an email listing 20 groups he considers leading advocates of amnesty. By telephone, Chmielenski said he doesn’t recall institute members testifying before Congress or speaking to immigration on news programs over the past few years nor does he consider them a top proponent of amnesty. "I definitely would not call them a national leader," he said. Contacted about what we found, Hirsch of Dewhurst's camp urged us to quiz two HAP Institute advisory board members, Jacob Monty and Massey Villarreal. Monty, a Houston lawyer, says in a statement posted online by Dewhurst’s campaign that Cruz was instrumental in helping the institute craft its "policy on immigration reform" and says he also supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, giving speeches about it. Bellsynder told us by phone: "There isn’t a institute policy or position paper on immigration at this point. We’ve weighed in on proposals." We failed to reach Villarreal, but Monty said by phone that Cruz always aligned with the institute’s support for comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for certain illegal residents. He said the group's support extended to members urging senators to back a failed 2007 immigration law overhaul proposed by Sens. Ted Kennedy and John McCain, which Bellsnyder confirmed. However, Monty told us, he has never viewed the institute as favoring unconditional amnesty. As we completed this review, Cruz spokesman James Bernsen sent emails pointing out that Monty has donated to Dewhurst's campaign and stressing Cruz's statements on the stump that he opposes amnesty. Our ruling Dewhurst says Cruz, who has said he opposes amnesty, "helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants." That’s weakened from the top because Cruz is on the advisory board for one -- not two -- relevant groups. The HAP Institute favors comprehensive immigration reform, including hurdles that illegal immigrants must clear to qualify for legal residency. It’s at least debatable whether that’s amnesty. Most significantly, we were struck by the utter lack of evidence for saying the institute has been leading the national push for amnesty. Far as we can tell, it’s not even among the top 20 advocacy groups on immigration policy. This misrepresentation isn’t just inaccurate; it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-10656	Biden was responsible for "ending genocide in Bosnia."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/31/joe-biden/he-was-one-voice-of-many/	In the waning days of the Iowa campaign, dark horse Democratic candidate Sen. Joe Biden has gone to the airwaves to distinguish himself as a steady leader with broad foreign affairs experience. One of his ads claims that he ended genocide in Bosnia. He explained in a 1997 speech: "Appalled by the naked Serbian aggression and genocidal attacks on Bosnian civilians, in September 1992 I called for a 'lift and strike' policy. ... "My views were not widely shared at that time. As the war escalated — with massacres, 'ethnic cleansing,' and rapes — a few other senators, including Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman, joined my call for action. But it took more than two years of failed diplomacy — and a quarter-million killed and 2-million homeless — before we finally came around to the 'lift and strike' policy in the fall of 1995. Guess what? The policy worked!" "Lift and strike" is shorthand for the policy of lifting the U.S. arms embargo against the Bosnian government and launching military strikes against the Bosnian Serbs accused of genocide. It's clear Biden was among the earliest and most vocal members of Congress to advocate an end to the violence. But it's wrong for him to take sole credit for ending the genocide. "He was a constant pest to push people in that direction," said Ivo H. Daalder, a former director for European affairs on the National Security Council and author of the book Getting to Dayton: The Making of America's Bosnia Policy. "There is no doubt that Joe Biden wanted to end the genocide and was willing to use force to end it before either the Bush or Clinton administrations." But Biden's influence remained that of one of 100 senators, noted Daalder, who now serves as an adviser to Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign: "The war was ended by a whole bunch of people, most of whom were in the administration." Indeed, it was former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke who was nominated for a 1995 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring the war in Bosnia to a close. It was Senate Majority Leader Dole who in 1995 filed the bill that Biden co-sponsored ending the arms embargo against Bosnia. Passage of that bill helped pave the way for President Bill Clinton to change his Bosnia policy. NATO, led by Gen. Wesley Clark, played its role, too, as did many other U.S. and international leaders. So yes, Biden wanted to stop the genocide. He played an influential role in the debate. But he didn't end the war himself, as his ad implies. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2007-12-31T00:00:00	2007-12-27	['Joe_Biden']
pomt-02057	"Solar panels drain the sun’s energy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/29/chain-email/claim-solar-panels-drain-suns-energy-are-satire-no/	Recently, several readers -- feeling depressed after reading that a promising type of clean, renewable energy was seemingly weakening the earth’s very life force -- asked us to check a claim circulating on social media that "solar panels drain the sun’s energy." Rest easy, readers: The claim stems from a bit of satire being passed along by the scientifically gullible. In mid May 2014, the website National Report published an article headlined, "Solar Panels Drain the Sun’s Energy, Experts Say." Here’s an excerpt: "This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming. "Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as ‘forced photovoltaic drainage.’ "‘Put into laymen’s terms, the solar panels capture the sun’s energy, but pull on the sun over time, forcing more energy to be released than the sun is actually producing,’ WIT claims in a scientific white paper published on Wednesday. ‘Imagine a waterfall, dumping water. But you aren’t catching the water in buckets, but rather sucking it in with a vacuum cleaner. Eventually, you’re going to suck in so much water that you drain the river above that waterfall completely.’ "WIT is adamant that there’s no immediate danger, however. ‘Currently, solar panels are an energy niche, and do not pose a serious risk to the sun. But if we converted our grids to solar energy in a big way, with panels on domestic homes and commercial businesses, and paving our parking lots with panels, we’d start seeing very serious problems over time. If every home in the world had solar panels on their roofs, global temperatures would drop by as much as thirty degrees over twenty years, and the sun could die out within three hundred to four hundred years.’" However, people passing along this story by email appear not to be aware that the National Report is a satire site. As we noted just a few days ago in another check of a National Report piece that went viral, the site’s tongue-in-cheek disclaimer says, in part, that "the views expressed by writers on this site are theirs alone and are not reflective of the fine journalistic and editorial integrity of National Report." The urban-legend investigation site Snopes.com has archived an even clearer disclaimer that has since been removed. The former disclaimer said, "National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways. All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental." (Snopes also debunked the solar panels story on May 25, 2014.) We checked with a solar energy expert to make sure we weren’t missing something, and they agreed that the sun-draining claim is pure hokum. "The sun is really big, really far away, and constantly producing mind-boggling amounts of energy through nuclear fusion. It couldn’t care less about your puny solar panel," said Mark Thurber, associate director of Stanford University’s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. The closer you read the National Report item, the more obvious the satire becomes. It turns out that the Wyoming Institute of Technology only exists as a website, with an obviously fake backstory. "WIT," according to the website, was originally founded in 1943 as the Wyoming Institute of Education and Nuclear Energy Research (WIENER, get it?) and has purportedly invented such technologies as "smellovision," the "space toilet," the world’s first computer virus, "the world’s first 100% organic artificial nose, which was created for pop-star Michael Jackson in 1999," and the "E-condom." Our ruling As is often the case, what you see on social media isn’t accurate. It’s not true that "solar panels drain the sun’s energy." This claim originated with a satirical site, and it has no basis in science. Cue the solar flares: It gets a Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-05-29T15:46:05	2014-05-19	['None']
pomt-13173	"On ISIS, (Michael Bennet) chose the (Washington) insiders over our generals."	mostly false	/colorado/statements/2016/oct/27/restoration-pac/group-says-sen-bennet-chose-washington-insiders-ov/	A new ad by a conservative group says U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, "chose the (Washington) insiders over our generals" in the battle against the Islamic State. The Restoration PAC ad says when it comes to national security, Bennet chose to "serve" the insiders instead of America. "On ISIS, he chose the insiders over our generals," said the ad’s narrator, who then refers to Bennet's Republican opponent. "Darryl Glenn made choices, too. Unlike Bennet, he'll always put America first," the narrator concludes. We asked Restoration PAC for evidence supporting its claim that Bennet "chose the insiders over our generals" in the fight against the terrorist group. The PAC supplied news stories and opinion commentaries that mostly criticized President Barack Obama’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq in late 2011. According to a 2014 Washington Times story cited by the PAC, Obama ignored a recommendation by Army General Lloyd J. Austin III to maintain an ongoing force of 23,000 U.S. soldiers to support the Iraqi Army as it assumed full responsibility for the nation's security. Without American military support and advisers, the Iraqi Army floundered, stopped training troops, and soldiers ran from battles as Islamic extremist groups rose up, the Washington Times reported. However, as PolitiFact has reported, Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished in Iraq after the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein, and the group eventually evolved into Islamic State. And the 2011 troop withdrawal deadline was forged by President Bush's 2008 Status of Forces agreement with then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who -- along with many Iraqis -- increasingly wanted the American military gone. Restoration PAC also cited an August Time magazine story, in which retired generals and unnamed current commanders said the Obama administration has a "bad strategy" for destroying Islamic State in Syria and Iraq that includes an "anemic application of force" and a lack of a local ground forces to reclaim territory from ISIS. Yet the Time story also states: "The U.S. is beating ISIS handily, judging by Vietnam’s body-count metric. The total number of ISIS battlefield deaths claimed by U.S. officials has jumped, from 6,000 in January 2015 to 45,000 last month—a bloodbath for an enemy force estimated to number about 30,000." What role does Michael Bennet play in any off this? Restoration PAC spokesman Dan Curry pointed to a December 2011 Bennet news release, saying it shows the senator supported Obama’s troop withdrawal from Iraq, which fueled Islamic State’s growth. "After nine long years, $1 trillion spent and 1 million service members deployed, Americans and Coloradans welcome the responsible end to the war in Iraq," Bennet said in the news release. "Our troops have performed bravely and effectively in Iraq and accomplished everything that was asked of them: securing communities and creating the space for democratic change to take root." Bennet wasn’t alone in supporting bringing the troops home. At the time Obama announced the withdrawal, three-quarters of Americans approved of it -- yet more than half of Republicans did not. In an earlier statement on the Iraq withdrawal, Bennet stressed that "serious threats against the United States remain, and we must continue to work to ensure we have the best-trained and best-equipped military in the world," Westword magazine reported. "Whatever Bennet's true motivation, he went along with Obama's plan over the advice of generals who warned pulling out of Iraq would be a disaster and it was," Curry said in an email to PolitiFact. The PAC also cites a Bloomberg TV interview days before the 2012 presidential election, where Bennet said: "I think the president gets enormous credit for promising to end the war in Iraq and ending the war in Iraq, for announcing a deadline on Afghanistan and sticking with that when his opponent is basically taking every position possible. And I think that the people of Colorado think he's a strong foreign policy president." Yet, Bennet has worked on bipartisan legislation to shield the country from terrorism attacks. He cosponsored the Visa Waiver Program Security Enhancement Act, a December 2015 bill to plug security gaps and prevent terrorists from entering the country. The Visa Waiver Program allows citizens of 38 countries to travel without a visa to the United States for business or tourism for stays of up to 90 days. Key sections of Bennet's bill were passed in December as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Now individuals who have traveled to Syria or Iraq in the past five years are required to acquire a traditional tourist visa instead of traveling to the United States without a visa under the waiver program. This requires them to be interviewed by an American consular official and submit biometric information, such as their fingerprints, so they can be vetted before they’re allowed to enter the United States. "We have to continue to do everything we can to degrade and destroy ISIS, including increased air strikes targeting their economic infrastructure and oil production. We also need to redouble our efforts to disrupt their recruitment online," Bennet told Colorado Public Radio recently. Our ruling Restoration PAC says Bennet "chose the (Washington) insiders over our generals" in the battle against Islamic State. The group says President Obama’s withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq fueled the rise of ISIS and blames Bennet for supporting the withdrawal and for generally backing Obama. However, Bennet has advocated for a strong defense against terrorism, passed legislation to prevent potential terrorists from using the Visa Waiver Program to easily enter the United States and backs initiatives to counter extremists from recruiting people online. It's a big stretch to say that because Bennet supported the withdrawal and welcomed home U.S. troops after a long war, he chose Washington insiders "over our generals."

pomt-00959	"Monarch butterflies are becoming extinct" because of increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/17/peter-defazio/are-gmos-causing-monarch-butterflies-become-extinc/	Monarch butterflies are an unexpected victim of the widespread adoption of genetically modified crops, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said last week. A genetically modified organism has had its DNA altered in a way that does not occur in nature. One purpose is to increase the plants’ tolerance to pesticides and herbicides. Opponents of GMOs, as they are called, believe they pose health risks, though there’s no generally accepted science that says GMO products are harmful to health. Environmental impacts, however, are the focus of DeFazio’s claim. DeFazio is an advocate for policies that would require food labels to indicate if the product was made with genetically modified crops. In an appearance on MSNBC with celebrity chef Tom Colicchio on Feb. 12, DeFazio said GMO crops are harmful to nature. "We certainly know there is going to be secondary harm to the environment," he said. "In fact, monarch butterflies are becoming extinct because of this sort of dumping, (the) huge increase in pesticides’ use because of these modified organisms." We decided to take a closer look at the effect of GMOs on the iconic orange and black butterflies. There’s little doubt that the monarch population is on the decline, but experts say that the adoption of genetically modified crops is not the sole factor. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the monarch population has dropped 90 percent over the past 20 years. Every winter, monarch butterflies migrate from the Midwestern United States corn-belt region to the Oyamel fir forests in Mexico. This chart from Monarch Watch, a conservation group, shows the steep population change, in terms of the total area occupied by monarchs during their winter stay in Mexico: The evidence suggests that DeFazio exaggerated when he said monarchs are "becoming extinct." The World Wildlife Fund classifies them as "near threatened," which means they are "likely to become endangered in the near future." That classification is several steps away from extinct. And conservation experts told us that they are optimistic that the monarch population can be at least partially restored if the right steps are taken. "Monarchs are not in danger of extinction," said Lincoln Brower, a monarch conservation scientist at Sweet Briar College. "What is endangered is their spectacular migration and overwintering behavior." Still, even if they are not on the verge of extinction, monarchs are certainly on the decline, at least for now. Why? Several reasons are evident, including deforestation in Mexico, recent weather patterns and reduced availability of milkweed, the butterflies’ main food source. The deforestation stems from illegal logging in Mexico. It has reduced the areas where monarchs can migrate, affecting their lifecycle. However, the Mexican government has largely curtailed the problem in the past five years, Brower said. As far as weather, a serious drought in Texas a couple years ago reduced the amount of flowers along the monarchs’ migration route. This is a problem because, in order to survive the migration, the butterflies need to pick up nectar along the way. And in 2014, an extra-long winter prevented monarchs from migrating successfully back to the United States from Mexico, Brower told the Washington Post. By far the biggest threat, though, is the lowered prevalence of milkweed, due to the increasing use of GMO crops that can withstand a heavy dose of herbicides, Brower said. Milkweed grows in and around crops such as corn and soybeans that are heavily concentrated in the U.S. Midwest. This is the monarch’s spring, summer and fall habitat, and milkweed serves as both the species’ primary food source and where its larvae grow. The problem is that, unlike the GMO crops in close proximity, the milkweed cannot withstand the herbicides. (Milkweed, like other weeds, can stifle crop yield, so farmers don’t like it.) Brower cautioned that there is not yet certain proof that the expansion of GMO crops is causing milkweed declines. But there is an "extremely tight correlation" among the increased use of herbicide-tolerant crops, fewer milkweed plants and the declining monarch population, he said. A 2012 study in the journal Insect Conservation and Diversity estimated that between 1990 and 2010, milkweed prevalence declined 58 percent in Midwest agricultural areas. Over the same time frame, the Monarch population declined 81 percent. By 2011, 94 percent of soybean crops were genetically engineered to withstand the widely used herbicide Roundup, and 72 percent of corn crops were herbicide-tolerant. Both genetically modified crops were introduced in the mid 1990s. Additionally, a 2007 congressional ethanol mandate increased the price of corn and soybeans, which encouraged farmers to convert grassland -- where milkweed grows -- into cropland, said Chip Taylor, director of Monarch Watch and a professor of ecology at the University of Kansas. Some argue that conservationists and the media have placed too much blame on GMOs for the loss of monarchs, saying correlation does not necessarily mean causation. Andrew Kniss, a weed expert at the University of Wyoming, wrote in a blog post that the Insect Conservation and Diversity study does not specifically examine if the adoption of GMO crops and herbicides are the reason why milkweed is dying out. There could be another cause, he said. To back up his point, Kniss pointed to a study out of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Pennsylvania State University that showed only limited effects of herbicide-tolerant plants -- and the use of herbicides -- on native plant diversity outside the border of the agricultural field. Our ruling DeFazio said that "monarch butterflies are becoming extinct" because of increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides. The evidence of a connection is suggestive but not conclusive. Monarch populations have been declining alongside a shrinkage in its primary food source -- milkweed -- and the increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides and herbicides. However, causation has not been established yet, and other culprits -- deforestation and unexpected weather events -- are likely to have played a role as well. Moreover, DeFazio exaggerated when he said that the butterfly species is "becoming extinct." It faces significant challenges, but monarchs remain several steps away from extinction, and many conservationists think the trend can be mitigated. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Peter DeFazio	None	None	None	2015-02-17T16:06:06	2015-02-12	['None']
pomt-10752	"More people in this country have seen UFOs than I think approve of George Bush's presidency."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/31/dennis-kucinich/bush-beats-aliens-by-16-points/	During the Democratic debate on Oct. 30, 2007, moderator Tim Russert asked longshot candidate Dennis Kucinich about a report that he had seen an unidentified flying object near the home of actress Shirley MacLaine. (MacLaine is the godmother of Kucinich's daughter.) Kucinich didn't say he believed in aliens, but he confirmed that he did see a mysterious light in the sky -- an unidentified flying object. Kucinich also had the snappy retort to Russert's playfulness: "More people in this country have seen UFOs than I think approve of George Bush's presidency." So do they? Russert's question riffed off a new Associated Press/Ipsos poll done for Halloween, which asked people about their belief in and experiences of the paranormal. The poll found 14 percent said they had seen a UFO themselves, and 34 percent said they "believed in" UFOs. We'll take the 14 percent of the people at their word that they did indeed see strange flying objects with no everyday explanation. But that's still a good 16 to 21 points below George Bush's approval ratings, which have hovered in the 30 to 35 percent range in 2007. Kucinich would have been accurate if he had said "More people BELIEVE in UFOs than approve of Bush's presidency." But because he said it the way he did, we find his claim to be False.

pomt-03470	Says a group "estimates that the annual cost to Oregon taxpayers for government services to illegal aliens, after any income tax revenue from them, is $1 billion."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/15/oregon-republican-party/do-illegal-aliens-cost-oregon-1-billion-year/	The Oregon Republican Party endorses an initiative to overturn a new law that allows people in the country illegally to apply for special driving cards in Oregon. Suzanne Gallagher, the state party’s chairwoman, issued a press release with a list of reasons to reject the bill that was signed into law by Gov. John Kitzhaber on May 1. Here’s one reason that caught our eye: "OFIR estimates that the annual cost to Oregon taxpayers for government services to illegal aliens, after any income tax revenue from them, is $1 billion." Oregonians for Immigration Reform is a vocal and passionate group that opposes illegal immigration. OFIR did not itself calculate the costs, but relies on a December 2012 report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington, D.C., organization that also opposes illegal immigration. FAIR offers state analyses as well as a national analysis. It is impossible to get firm numbers when it comes to undocumented immigrants. Furthermore, studies differ on whether they are a net drain or net gain or have a negligible effect on government. Recent news reports indicate that unauthorized workers put more money into Social Security and Medicare than they will get out, because they’re not eligible for those benefits. Actually, they are not eligible for most government assistance, but their children, born in the United States, are U.S. citizens and can qualify for medical assistance and social services. Our sister PolitiFact publications have tackled similar statements in their states and ruled differently: Half True in Georgia and False in Florida and in New Jersey. They could not offer better calculations on the costs of immigration. We won’t either. FAIR study How did FAIR figure a $1 billion hit to taxpayers in Oregon? First, the organization estimates that 170,000 undocumented immigrants -- or "illegal aliens" -- and their children live in Oregon. Schooling costs make up roughly half of the $1.077 billion they consume in government services; K-12 classes plus help for students with limited English skills make up nearly three-quarters of the $1.077 billion. The rest of the costs to taxpayers comes from criminal justice and social services. On the flip side, FAIR estimates that undocumented immigrants contribute about $77 million a year in the form of gas, property, income and tobacco taxes. The yearly difference, then, is $1 billion. The Pew Hispanic Center puts the undocumented population in Oregon at 160,000, with a low of 110,000 to a high of 220,000. FAIR’s overall number of 170,000 is in the ballpark. FAIR estimates there are 10,715 undocumented children in Oregon schools, plus 48,215 children born in the country to undocumented parents, for a total of 58,930 children in Oregon schools. Public schools don’t track the information, as they must provide education regardless of documentation. What we do know is that in 2011-12 there were roughly 59,000 students identified as "English Language Learners" in Oregon, of which 46,500 receive language development services, according to a spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Education. Obviously, not every child who needs help learning English is in the country illegally, or is the child of parents who are here illegally, but this leads us to think that FAIR’s population estimates could be, again, within field-sized ballpark range. The statewide average cost to educate a child was $9,364 in state, local and federal money in 2011-12. Schools receive from the state an additional $3,000 -- very roughly -- for each child who needs special language programs. Using FAIR’s numbers, you end up with $100.3 million to educate undocumented children and $451 million to educate children born in the country to undocumented parents. That’s close to FAIR’s overall estimate of $575 million for K-12 education. FAIR also calculates an extra $159 million to provide special English language classes for students. Most of that, $130 million, goes to help U.S. citizens, according to the analysis. We end up with $140 million if we multiply 46,500 students by $3,000. The rest of the study is summarized this way: About $111 million for health and emergency care, including $85 million for U.S.-born children; about $140 million for policing and incarceration of criminals; about $13 million for food and child care assistance on behalf of citizen children; and roughly $79 million in miscellaneous. Critics FAIR’s reports have been greatly criticized by both the Immigration Policy Center and Competitive Enterprise Institute. Both groups say that the analysis inflates the economic harm done by undocumented immigrants, ignores the tax benefits of immigration, and perhaps more significantly, unfairly includes the costs of educating and providing health care for U.S.-born children. FAIR says it’s fair to include the costs of educating children born in the United States. "We don’t try to hide that we are including the costs," said Ira Mehlman, a FAIR spokesman. "If not for the fact the parents were here breaking the law, we would not be incurring the costs." The Oregon Center for Public Policy did its own analysis in January 2012. The economic think tank is friendly to immigrants and estimates that the 110,000 to 220,000 undocumented immigrants in the state earn between $2.3 billion to $4.5 billion a year, which they spend on goods and services. The center also estimates workers pay between $154 million to $309 million in taxes, including Social Security and Medicare taxes they won’t be able to use later, as well as property, state and local taxes. Their employers also pay taxes on behalf of workers. Advocates of stricter immigration rules argue that those benefits are over-inflated because legal residents and U.S. citizens could just as easily hold those jobs. Ruling The Oregon Republican Party states that an outside organization "estimates that the annual cost to Oregon taxpayers for government services to illegal aliens, after any income tax revenue from them, is $1 billion." This is a murky area and if we could calculate a definitive balance sheet of what illegal immigration costs taxpayers, well, we’d be in a different line of work. Still, our reporting finds the education cost estimates are plausible. What is problematic is that well more than half of the $1 billion can be credited to U.S. citizens. FAIR’s own numbers suggest nearly $700 million for the lawful children of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Those citizens are not "illegal aliens." The $1 billion calculation also ignores taxes paid by and on behalf of undocumented workers. The statement includes an element of truth. There is some basis for some of the numbers. We can sympathize with critics of illegal immigration who say it’s appropriate to include the costs of educating children, even if they are U.S. citizens. But citizens are not "aliens" and the bulk of the estimated $1 billion goes to provide services to people entitled to receive those services. We find the statement Mostly False.

pomt-00103	"A lot of people are still dealing with lack of access to health care. There are counties out there, in my former Senate district, that didn’t have doctors and providers."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/30/troy-balderson/ohio-troy-balderson-brings-seldom-mentioned-health/	Obamacare was supposed to make health coverage available to most Americans. But for someone to get coverage, an insurance company must sell it -- and that’s a problem when insurers pull out of a market, as they have in recent years, says an Ohio candidate in a 2018 congressional contest. Troy Balderson, who won a race this summer for a temporary stint representing Ohio’s 12th Congressional District and now is running to keep it, reminded voters of this recently. Discussing the Affordable Care Act on Columbus TV, Balderson, a Republican, said access is one of the health law’s shortcomings. He sees plenty of others -- he is a "repeal and replace" advocate -- but lots of other candidates are talking about those, and this was different enough to catch our attention. "A lot of people are still dealing with lack of access to health care," Balderson told Scott Light, an anchor of WBNS, during an Oct. 20 program on the race between Balderson and his Democratic opponent, Danny O’Connor. "There are counties out there, in my former Senate district, that didn’t have doctors and providers." Did that really happen? And wasn’t the ACA supposed to provide access to care, not remove it? Let’s see how things have turned out. Last year’s worries Broadly speaking, Balderson was referring to the start of the Affordable Care Act, his campaign said. The main provisions began in 2014. "Numerous insurers pulled out of communities and counties when Obamacare was enacted leaving many of the constituents in my former State Senate district to drive to other parts of Ohio, and even across state lines, for their health care needs," Balderson told PolitiFact in a statement. "This was just the beginning of the problems with Obamacare, and it's one of the many reasons I am committed to solving the problems in our healthcare system so patients have access to affordable care by a doctor in their community." We’ll look at what happened at the beginning. But first, since Balderson was speaking in such narrow geographical terms, it helps to go back just one year, to the summer of 2017. That’s when health insurers were preparing for the coming year and the Ohio Department of Insurance announced preliminary participation by county. The number of insurers selling policies in the ACA marketplace was falling, with some companies complaining the cost of care was too high or the ACA market, mired in political controversy, was too uncertain. For a time, it looked as if 20 Ohio counties might wind up with no insurers at all in the ACA’s individual market for 2018. That included Guernsey, Morgan and Muskingum counties, in Balderson’s Senate district. What would people do if that happened? It became unnecessary to answer that question, because Gov. John Kasich and the Ohio Department of Insurance persuaded insurers working in other counties to fill the void. The crisis was averted. Nevertheless, 42 out of Ohio’s 88 counties wound up with only one insurer, and 20 counties wound up with two, according to the state insurance department. That meant residents buying policies on the individual exchange had limited or no choice of insurers. It also meant that if they wanted to stay in-network and avoid potentially big costs, they had to use the doctors and hospitals chosen by the limited number of insurers. More time We looked at the three above-mentioned counties to see how this played out. Guernsey, Morgan and Muskingum counties have only one ACA insurer now, CareSource. Each also had only one insurer in 2017. That insurer was Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. In other words, people buying ACA policies in both 2017 and 2018 had only one choice, but that choice required a change from Anthem in 2017 to CareSource in 2018. In 2016, the choice for those consumers was much broader, since Guernsey and Muskingum had 5 companies vying for ACA customers and Morgan had six. The ACA market has never been entirely static. From its start, insurers tested it for a year or two and then made new decisions. For example, in 2014, Guernsey and Muskingum counties had two insurers, and Morgan had three. Two more insurers decided to enter each of those counties in 2015, and one more in each county in 2016. That was the trend: A small number of insurers came into the market, more joined it the next year and even more the year after. But then came a retreat in 2017, with some insurers beating a path out. Rural counties hit hardest We were curious to see if fewer people bought insurance coverage as the number of carriers fell. So we looked at ACA enrollment data reported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, comparing 2016, when there were more choices, and 2018. Two of the counties, Muskingum and Guernsey, both of which went from five insurers to one, saw a drop in insurance purchases -- Muskingum by nearly 16 percent, Guernsey by 9 percent. Yet Morgan, which went from six insurers to one, saw a 7 percent rise. Because of other factors, including the economy, it is impossible to say there was a direct cause and effect. This is not to minimize the difficulty there, but for insurers, these are tiny markets. Only 1,504 people bought ACA policies Muskingum County this year, and only 303 in Morgan and 676 in Guernsey, according to CMS data. Looking up Balderson spoke of the past. But what lies ahead? It turns out that Ohio will gain two more insurers in 2019, although they won’t all participate in each county, bringing the statewide total from eight to 10. One of the new ones is Anthem, which retreated from Ohio amid uncertainty over the ACA but is coming back. In Balderson’s old Senate district, Guernsey County, now with one ACA insurer, will have two next year, according to the state. So will Morgan County. And Muskingum will have three. A broader view Before we rule on Balderson’s claim, it’s important to note that Balderson says he was speaking of changes after the ACA’s enactment, not just last year. So we wanted to look at pre- and post-ACA factors. But we found that good county-by-county counts of insurers didn’t exist before the ACA because there weren’t requirements to keep them at such a narrow level. But what about states? Were there more carriers in each state -- providing more access -- before the ACA? The problem with such comparisons, we found, is they are like comparing apples to oranges. The nature of the policies and their coverage was different before the health law kicked in in 2014. Before the ACA, a company could reject customers with pre-existing conditions, pay for fewer kinds care, close off enrollment or insure only a tiny or select group of people, Cynthia Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation told us. In fact, insurers set up subsidiaries sometimes for just that purpose. "So before the the ACA, you see a bunch of plans with about five people enrolled in them," Cox, the Kaiser foundation’s director for health reform and private insurance, said. She said that in 2006, 27 percent of plans in a given state had fewer than 100 enrolles. To make accurate comparisons, Cox looks at the number of insurers that are significant competitors, a measure that groups subsidiaries as part of the parent company. A significant competitor is a company with more than 5 percent of a state’s market share. In Ohio, there were three such companies in 2011, three years before the ACA kicked in. The number grew to four with the start of the ACA, then to five in 2015, then back to four in 2016. Overall, the trend nationally -- the number of carriers -- is "remarkably flat," Cox said. There are other ways to measure access to care, including changes in the number of uninsured people, although that includes a large number who got coverage through Medicaid’s expansion, a facet of the ACA. Counting them, the share of uninsured Ohioans fell by 45 percent -- to 6 percent -- between 2013 and 2017, U.S. Census figures show. Our ruling Balderson said that "a lot of people are still dealing with lack of access to health care." He then spoke specifically about people in his former Ohio Senate district. It is true that a number of them dealt with changes, especially in the counties we mentioned. Nearly half of all Ohio counties, each in a small market, wound up with only a single ACA carrier this year. For some people, that changed their access to the doctors and hospitals they preferred. Yet things will improve for many in 2019. And even counting all the changes since the ACA began, many more people have health coverage now than before. This has been part of the ACA’s push and pull from the start. If you are a constituent who lost access to your preferred insurer or provider, you might have called Balderson to urge him to fight for change. If you are a citizen who got health care because of the ACA, you might have joined a protest in hopes Congress will leave it alone. That’s why we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-14047	Says Will Hurd "cosponsored a bill that would militarize our border and allow 200 miles of new roads to be built in the Big Bend region -- cutting up our beloved park."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/may/25/pete-gallego/did-will-hurd-vote-border-security-bill-would-cut-/	U.S. Rep. Will Hurd paints himself as a defender of Big Bend National Park after penning a June 9, 2015 letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission calling for greater federal oversight in construction of the Trans-Pecos Pipeline. But former Rep. Pete Gallego, the Alpine Democrat, doesn’t see Hurd, R-Helotes, as much of friend to the national park, which includes 118 miles of U.S.-Mexico border and is located entirely within the sprawling 23rd Congressional District of Texas. Gallego is challenging Hurd in a November 8 general election, a rematch that saw Gallego lose to Hurd two years ago in the "swing" congressional district. Gallego has gone after Hurd’s voting record as a defender of the national park in an attack ad and news releases. In an April 22, 2016 press release, Gallego said Hurd co-sponsored "a bill that would militarize our border and allow 200 miles of new roads to be built in the Big Bend region -- cutting up our beloved park." Gallego said he was concerned about the Secure Our Borders First Act, or House Resolution 399, introduced by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, on Jan. 16, 2015. The bill would bring an increase in federal agents and hundreds of new miles of roads to Texas’ most scenic area. In a Jan. 17, 2015 video, McCaul said his measure sets new infrastructure requirements for each U.S. Customs and Border Protection sector along the entire U.S.-Mexico border and provides penalties to step up security. According to congressional records, Hurd was one of 15 original cosponsors of HR 399. Ten of the original cosponsors were Texas Republicans; all of the bill’s cosponsors, totalling 29 representatives as of Jan. 22, 2015, were Republicans. The bill authorizes new roads across the entire southern U.S. border with Mexico, and it specifies construction in what U.S. Customs and Border Enforcement calls the Big Bend sector. The sector, formerly called the Marfa sector, encompasses 77 Texas counties and the state of Oklahoma — 165,154 square miles. The Hurd-backed measure, which cleared the McCaul-chaired House Committee on Homeland Security on Jan. 21, 2015, requires 192 miles of road to be built in the Big Bend sector federal land, which includes the national park. It also authorizes three Forward Operating Bases with detention space, power and water, and a helicopter landing zone, and six miles of vehicle fencing. To our query about the backup for Gallego’s claim, campaign spokesman Anthony Gutierrez pointed out by email that "the legislation in question specifically directs the chief of Border Patrol to prioritize the ‘physical land border’ and to move personnel to the border...Big Bend National Park is on the border." The bill also waives 16 different federal laws relating to historical preservation, conservation and the environment — a major reason why a coalition of 85 environmental advocacy groups including the Sierra Club opposed the bill in a Jan. 27, 2015 letter to Congress. It also forbids the Agriculture and Interior secretaries from restricting Customs and Border Protection activity on federal land located within 100 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, for the purposes of conducting a list of activities that begins with "Construction and maintenance of roads." Dan Millis of the Sierra Club’s Borderlands program said: "Oftentimes these supposed border bills are disguised as border bills but they’re really public land attacks," he said. "In addition to waiving these important laws, the miles of border walls cause flooding, fragment wildlife habitat, and block wildlife migration corridors, and they don’t work—people are able to climb walls." Unlike states to the west, Texas doesn’t have much federal land along the border — only Big Bend, a wildlife refuge in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and the small Amistad Canyon National Recreational Area. That doesn’t mean that the roads the bill requires would necessarily be built in the park, but it does mean there would be less of a logistical hurdle to building roads in the park than elsewhere in the sector, since the government could skip the hassle of eminent domain claims on private land. To our inquiry, Justin Hollis, Hurd's campaign manager , said by email that the bill "would not authorize hundreds of miles of roads through the park or threaten natural habitats." Hollis pointed out that the Big Bend sector for Customs and Border Protection is far larger than just Big Bend National Park. But many of the provisions in the bill are specific to areas within 100 miles of the border or targeted at increasing "border accessibility." Because environmental protection laws would be waived, Gallego claims the bill would allow roads to be built in the park — but how likely is it that the roads would actually go through the park, as opposed to elsewhere in the sector? To find out where the roads might go, we spoke to Homeland Security committee staffer Paul Anstine. "The law mileage that you see in the bill were developed in close consultation with stakeholders like" the Border Patrol "and other people who are involved in the border security business but specifically where mile ‘x’ of 190 would go, that’s something that, in general, we defer to the executive branch," Anstine said, adding that the Border Patrol "is probably in the best position to tell you where each and every mile of the road needs to go, what areas they need access to." Anstine also pointed out that since the 2005 passage into law of the Real ID Act, it has been within the power of the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive laws protecting national parks for border security purposes. By email, Bill Brooks, Supervisory Public Affairs Specialist for CBP in Marfa, said he would not comment on pending legislation, but that the CBP sector and the park have "an excellent working relationship. In fact we have agents who live and work in the park. Additionally, we are most respectful of the environment in the park. As a matter of fact, when it is time to go off road to pursue illegal immigrants, we do it on horseback." We wondered whether other federal agencies might be able to shed light on the bill. A Jan. 22, 2015 statement by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson offered a sharp rebuke of the policies outlined in the bill, calling them counterproductive and "not a serious effort at legislating border security — and its authors know it." "The bill is extreme to the point of being unworkable; if enacted, it would actually leave the border less secure. The bill sets mandatory and highly prescriptive standards that the Border Patrol itself regards as impossible to achieve, undermines the Department of Homeland Security’s capacity to adapt to emerging threats, and politicizes tactical decisions," Johnson wrote. Our ruling Gallego said Hurd "cosponsored a bill that would militarize our border and allow 200 miles of new roads to be built in the Big Bend region -- cutting up our beloved park." Gallego accurately recapped key elements of the Secure Our Borders First Act backed by Hurd and other Texas Republicans in the House. The legislation would clear the way for construction of 192 miles of new roads, towers and law enforcement facilities along the border on federal lands in the vast Big Bend region of Texas. But whether these mandated moves entail carving up the treasured national park remains to be seen—or at least, Gallego didn’t prove nor could we confirm that outcome. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 6:00 p.m., May 27, 2016: After we published this fact check, the Gallego campaign pointed out that the Hurd-backed bill exempts both private and state-owned land, leaving only federal lands available for construction of roads and other border security measures called for in the legislation. We’ve corrected this fact check to show this exemption; it did not change our rating of this claim.	None	Pete Gallego	None	None	None	2016-05-25T20:00:00	2016-04-22	['None']
pomt-06652	"The first round of stimulus ... it created zero jobs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/12/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-2009-stimulus-created-zero-jobs/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry criticized President Barack Obama's new jobs plan during a Republican presidential debate Sept. 12, 2011, saying his previous effort "created zero jobs." WOLF BLITZER: "Gov. Perry, the president in his new plan has a lot of tax cuts, payroll tax cuts, middle-class tax cuts, tax credits for hiring veterans, tax credits for hiring long-term unemployed people. Are those things you would support?" RICK PERRY: "And he's going to pay for them all with raising your taxes. That is the issue. He had $800 billion worth of stimulus in the first round of stimulus. It created zero jobs, $400-plus billion dollars in this package. And I can do the math on that one. Half of zero jobs is going to be zero jobs." PolitiFact has regularly checked job claims about the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, so this one caught our ears. Zero? Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts said in February 2010 that the stimulus bill "didn't create one new job." He earned a Pants on Fire. Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott said in September 2010 during his successful campaign for governor that the stimulus bill had "not created one private sector job." We smelled smoke. (We even found Billy Weston, a Florida Republican who personally credited the stimulus for his new job with a private Riviera Beach pharmaceutical manufacturer.) So, what's the evidence? The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Just for the quarter April 1 to June 20, 2011, the country had a reported 555,029 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the Recovery Act. As our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia have pointed out, in a report released March 18, 2011, the president’s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010. Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found: • CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. • IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created. • Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created. • Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created. Note the language "created or saved," which means not every one of those more than a million jobs count as "created," as Perry said. But certainly more than zero. Ask Billy Weston. Perry said "the first round of stimulus ... created zero jobs." We say Pants on Fire.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-09-12T23:15:04	2011-09-12	['None']

That’s particularly true in California’s 45th Congressional District in Orange County, where Republican Rep. Mimi Walters is attempting to hold onto a seat in a district that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. House Majority PAC, a group aligned with Democrats, puts Trump and Walters side by side a new TV ad. With Trump and Walters brand beer bottles in the background, and someone singing "99 Bottles of Beer," the House Majority PAC ad claims Walters votes with the president "99 percent of the time." The ad also says Walters "took big bucks from insurance interests" and that she voted for Trump’s plan to "strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and slap an age tax on older Californians." We addressed those claims in a separate fact-check. Here, we focus in on whether Walters’ votes put her in lock-step with Trump in a district that supported Clinton two years ago. 99 percent? House Majority PAC says Walters votes with Trump "99 percent of the time." That figure tracks back to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight. FiveThirtyEight tracked 93 key congressional votes since Trump took office to see whether members of Congress support or oppose the president’s agenda. According to FiveThirtyEight, Walters voted on Trump’s side in all but two instances. In one case, Walters missed a vote to rescind previously approved but as of yet unspent federal funding. Trump supported rescinding those federal dollars. In a second case, in July 2017, Walters voted to approve additional sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea that Trump had opposed. When you factor out the missed vote, according to FiveThirtyEight, Walters agreed with Trump in 91 of 92 instances, or 98.9 percent of the time. Five Congressional Republicans lined up a perfect 100 percent of the time with Trump, while Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., only voted in line with Trump 49 percent of the time. We decided to check Congressional Quarterly as well, which also tracks how members of Congress voted when the president took a clear position. That includes statements of administration policy provided in advance of the vote, as well as his messages to Congress, news conference remarks and other public statements and documents. According to CQ (subscription required), Walters supported the president in 100 percent of the time in 2017. So, when it comes to votes, Walters has been almost always on the side of Trump. One caveat: As we have said in the past, you can debate the value of these types of comparisons, as they may overlook instances where an elected official bucked the leader of his or her party. Walters did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling The House Majority PAC says that Walters votes in line with Trump 99 percent of the time. It is true that Walters has supported Trump’s agenda in almost every case. FiveThirtyEight looked at 93 votes and found Walters on the side of the president 99 percent of the time. CQ said Walters agreed with Trump 100 percent of the time in 2017 in the votes they studied. The caveat in claims like these is that you can debate the usefulness of the statistic itself.

pomt-03113	"Since sequester began federal employment has been subtracting 6,000-7,000 jobs per month"	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/20/political-line/math-sequester-job-cuts-doesnt-add/	There has been a renewed focus on jobs and how many the economy has lost as Republicans and Democrats continue to do battle and threat of a government shutdown looms. Recently a political commentator took to Twitter highlighting job losses since across-the-board, automatic federal budget cuts -- known as sequestration -- took effect March 1. "Since sequester began federal employment has been subtracting 6,000 to 7,000 jobs per month," the Political Line Twitter post said. If Political Line’s claim is correct, that would mean between 30,000 and 35,000 federal jobs have been lost for the five months, through August, that the sequester has been in effect. That type of possible job loss had us intrigued, so we decided to follow the numbers. PolitiFact Georgia emailed Political Line and visited its website for more information about the claim and about the author but received no response to our requests. Political Line is a political blog of postings on a variety of national topics from health care to drug policy, along with an aggregation of news stories. Under sequestration, the federal government will cut about $85 billion in spending by the end of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. As a previous PolitiFact sequestration fact check noted, putting money into the economy does create jobs, and less money leads to fewer jobs in the short run. There have been numerous reports of the sequester’s impact, including departments limping along on tight budgets, employees forced to take unpaid furlough days and Head Start students being cut from the rolls. And this week, Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray blamed the horrific Navy Yard shooting on the sequester. When asked by CNN anchor Chris Cuomo how shooter Aaron Alexis, who was being treated for mental health issues, was still able to get access to areas that he probably shouldn’t have had, Gray responded: "As I look at, for example, sequestration, which is about saving money in the federal government being spent, have we somehow skimped on what would be available for projects like this and then we put people at risk," Gray said on CNN’s "New Day" the morning after the shooting. Those accounts have provided anecdotal evidence about sequestration’s impact. But when it comes to the actual number of jobs lost to sequestration, we really just don’t know, said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow and federal budget policy expert at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning D.C. think tank. "There isn’t anyone, including (the federal Office of Management and Budget), that has gone agency by agency and says what did you do, and how did you do it, and say how many jobs were lost," Lilly said. As for Political Line’s claim, with millions of federal employees, the 6,000-7,000 monthly job loss is statistically not a big thing, Lilly said. "You could lose that many with just inaccurate or inconsistent reporting. It makes sense to me." With no official analysis, numbers from multiple studies and financial reports have been used to detail sequester job cuts. In February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 750,000 more full-time jobs would be created in the U.S. economy by the end of the year without sequestration. A Goldman Sachs study, released this month, noted that the sequestration could end up costing another 100,000 federal jobs in the next few quarters, and that federal jobs have declined by 71,000 since last year. To get a more accurate count, we reviewed month-to-month federal government employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics from March 2013 (when sequestration began) through August, the most recent data available. Month All federal employees Month-to-month change Federal employees, minus postal workers Month-to-month change March 2,762,000 2,173,400 April 2,777,000 15,000 2,169,000 (4,400) May 2,757,000 (20,000) 2,168,200 (800) June 2,761,000 4,000 2,172,100 3,900 July 2,753,000 (8,000) 2,162,000 (10,100) August 2,752,000 1,000 2,162,100 (100) The BLS data showed that federal employment varied from month to month. Some months saw job losses exceeding Political Line’s claim of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs lost; but other months saw job gains. So what about Political Line’s claim? The political blogger said in a Twitter post that since sequestration, federal government jobs have decreased 6,000-7,000 jobs a month. There has been no official analysis of jobs lost to the sequester. There is anecdotal evidence that the budget cuts have hurt the federal sector, but at the same time, there have been job gains -- albeit marginal -- in the private sector. Using the best data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the numbers show that some months federal job losses reached and exceeded Political Line’s claim, but in other months, the losses were much less, and there were even job gains. Political Line’s statement contains an element of truth, but it needs clarification and additional information. Reviewing the data over the previous 12 months does show an overall downward trend in federal government jobs, but the monthly totals fluctuate. And overall the job reduction is far less than the statement would indicate. We rate it Mostly False.	None	The Political Line	None	None	None	2013-09-20T00:00:00	2013-09-11	['None']
pomt-01042	Middle-class Americans "pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/25/tammy-baldwin/middle-class-pays-higher-tax-rates-millionaires-se/	In his sixth State of the Union address, President Barack Obama called on Congress to raise taxes on the rich and give tax breaks to the middle class. It was a message similar to one issued a week earlier by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. "For far too long, our tax code has unfairly favored the wealthiest Americans, while middle-class families in Wisconsin have struggled to get ahead," Baldwin said in a Jan. 13, 2015 news release issued with U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. "I’m proud to once again join Senator Whitehouse to introduce the Paying a Fair Share Act, also known as the ‘Buffett rule.’ It is simply unfair to ask middle-class Americans to pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires." Do middle-class Americans pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires? Some do. And some don’t. The Buffett rule The so-called Buffett rule refers to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. In 2011, he famously pronounced that he paid only 17.4 percent of his taxable income in federal income taxes, a lower percentage than any of his 20 employees. He proposed that federal tax rates be raised for taxpayers making more than $1 million. Obama took note of Buffett's comments in his 2012 State of the Union speech. Later that year Baldwin and Whitehouse introduced legislation that included the so-called Buffett rule: Under the measure, people making more than $2 million per year would pay a minimum tax rate of 30 percent, while people making between $1 million and $2 million would see their minimum tax rates increase, on a sliding scale, up to 30 percent. The measure didn’t become law. Thus, the announcement from Baldwin and Whitehouse that they would reintroduce their legislation. Tax rates Hang with us here. The numbers can get kind of heavy. But it’s clear some -- though far from all -- middle-class Americans are paying higher tax rates. To back Baldwin’s claim about the disparity in tax rates, her office cited one portion of a March 2012 analysis of the proposed Buffett rule from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: A "large proportion" of millionaires pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than a "significant proportion" of moderate-income taxpayers, said the report, which defined moderate-income as taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000. More specifically, roughly a quarter of all millionaires face a tax rate that is lower than the tax rate faced by 10 percent of the moderate-income taxpayers. And on average, according to the report, the below-$100,000 taxpayers paid 35 percent of their taxable income in taxes (income and payroll), while the millionaires paid 30 percent. Of course, some middle-class taxpayers, and some millionaires, paid much lower or much higher rates. For instance, people in the 10th percentile of the below-$100,000 group paid a rate of 14 percent -- less than the 16 percent for the 10th percentile of the millionaire group. But looking at the 90th percentile in each group, the below-$100,000 group paid a rate of 49 percent, more than the 37 percent in the millionaire group. A key point: Higher-income taxpayers who enjoy low tax rates receive a very high proportion of their income from investment income, which is taxed at low rates, the report says. Conversely, lower-income taxpayers who face relatively high tax rates get most of their income from wages, which are subject to payroll taxes. In other words, your tax rate depends a lot on where your income comes from. We contacted the author of the report, economist Thomas Hungerford, who is now at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. He told us that since his report was published, taxes on wealthier Americans -- including on income, capital gains and dividends -- have been raised. But Hungerford said the thrust of his report remains accurate: A "substantial number" of middle-class Americans pay higher tax rates than some millionaires. A more recent report, published in December 2014 by the Tax Foundation, which promotes lower tax rates, noted that the top 1 percent of taxpayers paid a higher effective income tax rate (22.8 percent) than any other group and nearly seven times higher than taxpayers in the bottom 50 percent (3.28 percent). Our rating Baldwin said middle-class Americans "pay a higher tax rate than millionaires and billionaires." Some do and some don’t. For a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-09044	Says his GOP challenger, Doug MacGinnitie, "hadn’t voted in a Republican primary for almost 20 years until 2008.	false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/04/brian-kemp/secretary-state-brian-kemp-says-challenger-didnt-v/	There's no shortage of sniping in the Republican primary for Georgia secretary of state. Candidates have traded accusations of political careerism, incompetence and dishonesty for months. This time around, seven-month incumbent Brian Kemp and opponent Doug MacGinnitie are squabbling over their voter registration histories. Kemp said in a speech posted on YouTube that MacGinnitie failed to vote in Republican primaries for two decades. MacGinnitie countered by posting a commercial that says Kemp's record shows he voted for Democrats. They have both accused each other of "hypocrisy." The brawl made its way from the Internet to the airwaves when reporter Lori Geary confronted the rivals on WSB-TV June 28. They repeated their attacks and piled on a couple more. A separate Truth-O-Meter item will focus on MacGinnitie's attack on Kemp. This one addresses Kemp's attack on MacGinnitie. Kemp bashed his rival during a Cobb County GOP breakfast June 5. His campaign posted a recording of Kemp's speech on YouTube. “I’ve got a solid conservative record. But when you look at my opponent, he doesn’t tell you that he hadn’t voted in a Republican primary for almost 20 years until 2008,” Kemp told the crowd. That's a long time for a Republican to opt out of voting Republican. We requested MacGinnitie's voter history from the Georgia secretary of state, which keeps voting records. Records show that MacGinnitie voted 23 times in Georgia since 1988. Six were in the Republican primary process: in 1988 for president; 1996 for president; 1996 in the general primary runoff; 2000 for president; 2008 for president; and 2008 in the general primary. MacGinnitie voted twice in Democratic primaries: the 1988 general primary runoff; and the 1992 presidential primary. In those races, he was using the "Rush Limbaugh playbook" -- voting for the weakest Democrat to boost Republican chances for victory, his spokesman said. Six votes in Republican primaries is a bit more than none. We contacted the Kemp campaign for an explanation. They said that while MacGinnitie did vote in presidential Republican primaries, he didn't start voting in state Republican primaries until 2008, when he was gearing up to run for higher office. This is a major failing on MacGinnitie's part, a Kemp campaign consultant contended. In areas such as their opponent's heavily Republican neighborhood, the party primary can be even more important than the general election because Democrats are such a long shot. "In those areas, the state Republican primary is the entire election. It decides who wins, not the general election," campaign consultant Joel McElhannon told PolitiFact Georgia in an e-mail. What's worse, MacGinnitie sat on the sidelines at a time when local and state Republicans needed supporters, McElhannon said. For much of the past 20 years, the party was in the midst of a resurgence that made it possible for the GOP to dominate Georgia politics for the first time since the Reconstruction. MacGinnitie's spokesman acknowledged that his candidate's voting record has room for improvement. It's correct that primaries often decide elections in areas that lean heavily toward one political party, and MacGinnitie did not vote in state and local races that were important to the Republican Party. But the attack Kemp made on MacGinnitie has serious problems. During the Cobb breakfast, Kemp could have told voters that MacGinnitie did not vote in a state Republican primary for 20 years. This would have been accurate. Instead, he said his opponent did not vote in a "Republican primary." There's no mention of state primaries. Kemp's campaign countered that most Republican voters in party strongholds understand that "Republican primary" means "state Republican primary." They added that typically, Kemp does specify in speeches and campaign e-mails that he is talking about state Republican primaries, not national ones. Yet Kemp's speech in Cobb was not a one-time misstep. His campaign has made the same inaccurate claim over and again. A flier and list titled "Doug MacGinnitie's Documented Lies" his own campaign e-mailed to PolitiFact Georgia contained the same accusation. We rule Kemp's statement False.

pomt-00971	Our median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation.	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/feb/13/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-nh-had-highest-median-income-us/	For all its troubles, New Hampshire is actually pretty lucky — or so report, after report, after report, would say. Just ask Gov. Maggie Hassan. In her second inaugural speech in January and in her budget address Thursday, Feb. 12, Hassan, a Democrat, made a point of drawing attention to New Hampshire’s rosy reputation. "Our country’s economy continues to strengthen – and in many respects, New Hampshire remains ahead of the curve," Hassan said, ticking off a number of economic statistics. One was that "our median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation,." In both speeches, Hassan pointed out that statistics don’t always tell the whole story, saying that some working class families in the state continue to struggle. Still, was New Hampshire really at the top of the nation in 2013 in terms of household income? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check it out. The statistic Hassan cited came from data collected and compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. Specifically, her staff pointed to a set of data released in September 2014 that summed up the latest findings from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement. While the census conducts a population count every 10 years, it also compiles other types of data — on income, for example — through other surveys that occur more frequently. In this case, the data was collected over a period of three months in 2013 — February, March and April. According to the census data, New Hampshire’s median household income was $71,322 in 2013 — which was not only higher than the national median, but also higher than any other state. As with any survey, there are some limitations to consider. One factor concerns how the data was calculated. To determine income, the census asks people to report the money they received during the previous year from multiple sources, including: earnings, unemployment compensation, workers’ compensation, public assistance and more. The census also notes that "money income does not reflect the fact that some families receive part of their income in the form of noncash benefits," such as food stamps. As noted by Drew Desilver for Pew Research Center, "some economists say that income data have too many flaws to be the primary measure of inequality." "For one thing," Desilver said, "most income-inequality measures use income before taxes and transfer payments (such as Social Security, food stamps and unemployment benefits), which act to reduce inequality." Some researchers, Desilver notes, have instead suggested that other measures — someone’s consumption, for example — would be a better way to measure someone’s "economic well-being." Another factor to consider is the timing of the data. Using other census data that looks beyond just 2013, the year Hassan cited, shows that New Hampshire loses its top spot to Virginia when 2012 and 2014 information is considered. Our ruling Gov. Maggie Hassan said New Hampshire’s "median household income in 2013 was the highest in the nation." Looking at U.S. Census data only for that year, Hassan is correct. For other recent periods, however, New Hampshire ranks just below the top. In the meantime, census data is widely trusted, but other calculation methods may have produced different results. However, Hassan was correct in qualifying that statement by suggesting that the survey might not tell the whole story. The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Maggie Hassan	None	None	None	2015-02-13T16:17:15	2015-02-12	['None']
pomt-06526	"Today, the Social Security system is broke."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/09/steve-lonegan/conservative-activist-steve-lonegan-claims-social-/	If conservative activist Steve Lonegan is to be believed, millions of people throughout the country should not expect to receive any more Social Security checks. During a recent discussion on News 12 New Jersey’s Power & Politics show, Lonegan, state director of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group, suggested that the federal program had run out of money. Lonegan appeared on the show with Deborah Howlett, president of the left-leaning New Jersey Policy Perspective. "Today, the Social Security system is broke," Lonegan said during the show broadcast on Oct. 1 and 2. "For the first year since the 75 years Deb talked about, they’re in a cash-flow negative situation." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Social Security is facing long-term fiscal challenges, but the program is not broke. According to federal projections, scheduled benefits should continue to be paid in full for about another 25 years. Let’s explain how Social Security is funded. Social Security benefits and administrative costs are paid from two trust funds, which are made up of payroll taxes, income taxes on some Social Security benefits and interest owed by the government for fund balances. The surplus in any given year is turned over to the U.S. Treasury to finance other government operations in exchange for government securities. Those securities, which comprise the trust fund balances, essentially represent money the government owes itself. By the end of 2010, the trust funds held securities worth about $2.6 trillion. But here’s the sign of long-term fiscal woes: starting last year, Social Security no longer takes in enough annual tax revenue to cover its expenses each year. With interest earnings, the program’s total income will only be able to pay the bills until 2023. After the trust funds start to make up the difference, those reserves will be depleted by 2036. At that point, tax revenues would only support 77 percent of scheduled benefits. In 2085, tax income would cover 74 percent of scheduled benefits. So even if nothing is done to address the problem, roughly three-quarters of benefits would still be paid about 75 years from now. Lonegan argued that "broke" wasn’t too strong of a word to describe Social Security. The revenues don’t match the expenditures, and the government will have to borrow money to meet the obligations of the trust funds, Lonegan said. "They’re basically living on borrowed time," Lonegan said. Lonegan referred us to Peter Ferrara, who served in the White House Office of Policy Development under President Ronald Reagan. Ferrara agreed that Social Security is broke, partly because tax revenues don’t fully support the program and trust funds are just made up of securities. "Those trust funds are not real money," Ferrara said. Other experts we spoke to argued that Social Security is not broke. Henry Aaron, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank, pointed out how the U.S. Treasury bonds held by the trust funds are "the most secure asset in the world," and can be presented for payment at face value at any time. "Is a person 'broke' if he has a big bank account that is paying interest, which together with current earnings, more than covers expenses, so that the account balance is increasing?" Aaron said in an email. "I don't think so." Virginia Reno, vice president for income security policy for the National Academy of Social Insurance, said of Social Security: "It’s not broke in the sense that it’s gone." Stan Hinden, a Social Security expert with the American Association of Retired Persons, compared the program to his 15-year old car in need of repairs. "So, could you say that my car is ‘broken’?" Hinden said in an email. "No, I would say that I’ve got a great car with lots of mileage left. It just needs some repairs to keep it running well." Our ruling Lonegan claimed "the Social Security system is broke." It’s true that annual tax revenues no longer support the program’s expenses. But made up of government securities, Social Security’s trust funds should be able to cover full benefits until at least 2036. That deadline may be cause for concern, but it also means the system is not broke. We rate the statement False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02272	Charlie Crist "raised taxes in 2009 and won't rule out raising taxes again."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/08/republican-party-florida/charlie-crist-raised-taxes-2009-and-wont-rule-out-/	Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill that will cut auto tag fees and pointed the finger at his predecessor for raising them in the first place. "We are going to right the wrong of the 2009 tax increase that Charlie Crist enacted," Scott said as he signed the fee rollback on April 2. Scott, a Republican, is expected to face Democratic frontrunner Crist in November. The Republican Party of Florida joined the Crist-as-tax-hiker chorus on Twitter: ".@charliecrist raised taxes in 2009 and won't rule out raising taxes again." We’ll examine what type of taxes were raised under Crist in 2009 and what he has said about raising taxes in the future. Crist signed tax and fee increases in 2009 In May 2009, then-Republican Gov. Crist signed a $66.5 billion budget that included a slew of new taxes and fees -- roughly $2 billion worth -- intended to balance the state budget during the recession. The hikes included auto tag fees, a $1-a-pack cigarette tax, as well as higher fees to visit state parks and to file civil lawsuits and foreclosure actions. There is no dispute that Crist signed those tax and fee increases into law, but the Republican Party of Florida omits that the tax and fee hikes were supported by the Republican-led Legislature at the time. That includes influential Republican legislators who now in key leadership positions: Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, who was House majority whip at the time; House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel; and Senate President Don Gaetz. Recently, Crist made no apologies for supporting the auto tag increase when he spoke during an event in Tampa on the same day that Scott signed the cut into law. "We had to get through a tough time, and sometimes you have to make difficult decisions," Crist said in Tampa. "And we saved thousands of teachers' jobs, law enforcement officers' jobs, firefighters' jobs." What Crist has said about the potential for future tax increases As for Crist’s willingness to raise future taxes, the Republican Party of Florida pointed to a brief clip of MSNBC’s Ed Schultz interviewing Crist on Nov. 18, 2013, a couple of weeks after Crist declared his candidacy. We went looking for the complete exchange about taxes; here’s how it went: Schultz: "What is your philosophy of taxation? What would you do different. We have income inequality as a huge issue in this country. The wealthy seem to get the breaks. They have under the conservative rule. What would you do differently? What would you do with Florida’s finances and what would you expect? Would you expect more out of the wealthiest residents?" Crist: "Well, I think we all have to expect more out of each other. I don’t like to raise taxes. I don’t know that anybody really enjoys the idea of doing that. I did that as a governor, though." Schultz: "Would you do it again?" Crist: "If necessary, I would. I mean, you know." Schultz: "Is it necessary now?" Crist: "We have the highest budget we’ve had in the history of Florida right now at $74 billion. So, I don’t know if it’s necessary right now. I like to live within our means if we possibly can do so, but we have to properly fund public education. We have to properly fund the needs of the most vulnerable in our society. And when Governor Scott got elected, the very first session, he whacked public education funding by $1.3 billion." Schultz: "Would you restore that?" Crist: "Absolutely, we’d restore that." Schultz: "So that money would come back in under Charlie Crist." Crist: "Yes sir. It would. And the $300 million, he took out of higher ed the second session." Schultz: "And how would you pay for it?" Crist: "Pay for it by the existing revenues that we have. And if necessary, if we have to raise taxes, I would do it, but I’d rather not if we don’t have to. Like I said, I like to live within our means." Crist’s campaign website includes a mention of "tax cuts for middle-class families" on his policy position page about the economy and jobs, but it’s vague. It states: "Today, Florida’s tax policy works only if you are a special interest with a lobbyist – but it fails everyday Floridians and small business owners. As Governor, Charlie will reform government to put the people first, using incentives to help homegrown Florida small businesses grow the economy from the middle class out, not simply giving handouts to political supporters." We sent the claim by the Republican Party to Crist’s campaign and an informal adviser to the campaign, former state Sen. Steve Geller. Geller said Crist supports giving small businesses a tax break and pointed to part of Crist’s announcement speech in November: "As governor, we are going to have a tax policy that puts you the people first – and when we can cut taxes – and I do believe in cutting taxes – it is you the people who would get the relief – and when we spend money to help business, we are using it to grow the economy from the middle class out, not simply giving it away to supporters." Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said that Crist "raised taxes in 2009 and won’t rule out raising taxes again." Crist -- along with the Republican-led Legislature -- did raise the cigarette tax and a slew of fees including auto tag fees in 2009 to balance the budget during a recession. When asked in November if he would raise taxes in the future, Crist said "if necessary."

pomt-02734	"Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year."	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/18/peter-orszag/peter-orszag-says-medicare-spending-has-actually-f/	There’s broad agreement that one of the biggest challenges for the nation’s future fiscal health is rising federal spending on Medicare, the health insurance program for Americans age 65 and older. That’s why a recent claim that the costs are slowing down caught our attention. On the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of CNN's State of the Union, Peter Orszag said, "Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year." Orszag is the former director of the Office of Management and Budget for President Barack Obama. We wondered whether this was correct. Earlier this year, the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan budget-analysis arm -- projected that the cost of Medicare would rise (from 3 percent of gross domestic product today to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2038) due in large part to the aging of the baby-boom generation. So Orszag’s claim that Medicare costs are slowing down is notable and surprising. Initially, we had trouble finding monthly data for Medicare expenditures, but when we contacted Orszag, he pointed us to a CBO document, the "Monthly Budget Review for November 2013." (Orszag knows his CBO documents -- before taking the reins of OMB, he was CBO’s director.) In the document Orszag cited, CBO reported that, according to preliminary data, outlays for Medicare fell from $101 billion in October-November 2012 to $96 billion in October-November 2013. And the year-on-year decline was actually a little bit bigger once CBO smoothed out some calendar oddities. This fits the bill for what Orszag claimed -- a year-over-year decline in "nominal" Medicare costs. In fact, Orszag told PolitiFact, this decline is "all the more remarkable because the number of beneficiaries is rising." In the meantime, while an absolute decline in Medicare expenditures is especially notable, there is evidence that something less dramatic, but still noteworthy, has been underway for even longer -- a slowing of the growth of Medicare costs. That is, Medicare expenditures have recently been rising, but at a slower rate than in the past. This isn’t as favorable for getting the federal budget into balance as an absolute decline would be, but it’s still an important step in that direction. This trend is documented in an August 2013 CBO working paper, written by a pair of present or former CBO health care analysts, Michael Levine and Melinda Buntin. They concluded that the growth in spending per beneficiary in Medicare’s fee-for-service program "has slowed substantially in recent years," specifically from 2000 to 2010. The authors said the slowdown "has been widespread, extending across all of the major service categories, groups of beneficiaries that receive very different amounts of medical care, and all major regions." That said, the authors noted that their understanding of why this expenditure slowdown occurred "remains incomplete." And that is a problem that limits the usefulness of the data points Orszag offered on CNN. For starters, past performance does not equal future performance, noted Joseph Antos, a health care specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The pattern Orszag cites "does not mean a slower trend will last," Antos said. And while Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said she sees the recent data as a positive development, she added wistfully, "If only anyone knew why and whether it will last." Orszag doesn’t dispute their words of caution. "I agree it's unclear how long it will last, but I am more hopeful than some others," he said, arguing that the decline in expenditures is "consistent with major structural changes in the sector that I see happening every day. ... The bottom line is that it's not guaranteed to continue, but it's a huge deal if it does." Our ruling Orszag said, "Medicare costs have slowed down dramatically. In fact, the first two months of this fiscal year, Medicare costs were down even in nominal terms relative to the previous year." He’s right about the nominal decline in total Medicare expenditures over the past year, and he’s right that per-beneficiary spending declined broadly between 2000 and 2010. Determining the reasons why it’s happening remains a work in progress, but that doesn’t detract from the statement’s factual accuracy. We rate it True.

pomt-09136	Georgia could get money for schools by scraping “the gold off the gold dome” of the state Capitol.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/15/roy-barnes/barnes-suggests-mining-state-capitol-education-gol/	Okay, okay. We here at PolitiFact Georgia know that politicians are occasionally given to hyperbole. From time to time the political class seems driven to test the bounds of rhetorical gravity. And we feel inclined to test what they say. Take former Gov. Roy Barnes, a skilled orator and shrewd trial lawyer who to can turn on the aw-shucks routine with the best of them. Earlier this year, Barnes spoke in Summerville as part of the Chattooga County Chamber of Commerce’s annual meeting. And man-oh-man did he ever come up with the money quote as noted in the Chattanooga Times Free Press, which reported it in a news story about his speech. "If we have to scrape the gold off the gold dome, you make sure that education comes first," Mr. Barnes told the group, according to the news article. He made the same claim in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an opinion piece he penned in 2008. “If we have to scrape the gold off the Capitol dome to do it, so be it. It's worth it, and we owe it to our children,’ Barnes wrote. The state’s schools are in tough shape due to the grinding recession that has withered property values and diminished state and local coffers. The schools now need billions to avoid furloughs, layoffs and school closings. Chris Carpenter, Barnes’ campaign manager, said Barnes made the statement to show how important he considers education. The former governor has also mentioned closing the Governor’s Mansion and the state Capitol – the same one he wants to relieve of its gold top – to raise money for state schools. “He just thinks public education is the No 1 priority,” Carpenter said. “Obviously there is some rhetorical flourish there.” Flourish, smourish. We wanted to know how much the state could get if it the gold leaf was actually scraped off the venerable old dome and sold. Not a lot, as it turns out, despite the fact that gold has recently surged past $1,200 an ounce. Gold first graced the dome after a late 1950s Capitol renovation in which the old tin-covered dome as was done up in 43 ounces of the glittering stuff. It was milled to 1/5000th of an inch thick before being affixed to the roof. The gold originally traveled to Atlanta from Dahlonega, site of the nation’s first gold rush, in a caravan of seven mule-drawn covered wagons, which took three days to reach Atlanta. The gold was expected to last thirty or forty years but by the late 1970s it had deteriorated to the point that the dome to be re-gilded, a project completed in 1981. Mike Kramer, owner and president of The Gilder’s Studio, runs the Maryland-based company that re-gilded the dome again in 1998. Workers first scraped off what was left of the old gold. “We had people that parked at the Capitol complaining because we were getting gold scrapings on their cars,” Kramer said in a telephone interview. Kramer reckons his company used about 85 ounces of gold gilding material. He said the new dome should be good for another 20 or even 30 years – as long as politicians don’t start scraping on it. As for Barnes’ idea about cashing in on the shiny Capitol covering, Kramer was, well, less than enthusiastic. “You’d have to dry scrape it off, and I’d probably charge a hundred-grand for that,” he said. “Then you have to contain it. Then you have to refine because it’s attached to the zinc-chromate primer.” Kramer figured that only about 60 ounces of the original gold could be salvaged. A refiner would charge you 20 percent or so to extract it once it was scraped off, he said. So at $1,200 an ounce, you get about $72,000 for 60 ounces. Subtract the refiner’s fee and you’re down to $57,600. By the time you pay Kramer his $100,000 for scraping the orb in the first place, you are actually in the hole by more than $40,000. “You’re not going to make any money,” Kramer said. In fact you would lose money, and end up with a naked Capitol dome. And nobody wants that. We give the former governor a Pants On Fire for this one.

pomt-13852	Harris County, Texas has "some of the highest jailing and incarceration rates in the U.S. and the world."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jul/08/rodney-ellis/sen-rodney-ellis-says-harris-county-has-some-highe/	Editor’s note, July 8, 2016: We originally published this fact check on June 13 and rated the statement False. After that, experts pointed out we left out a step in our calculation of Harris County’s incarceration rate. We have updated our story and the rating has changed. You may read an archived version of the original article here. Equal Justice Under Law, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, filed a lawsuit against Harris County’s bail system alleging that hundreds of offenders are jailed for minor offenses every day because they cannot afford to make bail. The group says that since 2015, it has filed 10 class action challenges to money bail systems in eight states. The May 2016 suit led state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, to issue a press release on May 19, 2016, sharing his support of the legal action, saying, "Harris County’s overreliance on the inefficient and ineffective use of mass incarceration as a means of dealing with low-level and nonviolent offenses continues to result in some of the highest jailing and incarceration rates in the U.S. and the world." We’re familiar with incarceration rates. In August 2015, PolitiFact Virginia found Mostly True a claim the U.S. has the world’s highest incarceration rate -- meaning the greatest share of the population behind bars. In March 2016, we rated Mostly True a claim that Texas has a higher incarceration rate than Russia or Iran. So, does Harris County, the third most populous in the nation, also have one of the highest incarceration rates in the country and world? The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics defines an incarceration rate as the number of inmates per 100,000 residents held in state or federal prisons or local jails. To our request for the senator’s factual backup, Ellis aide David Edmonson emailed a spreadsheet listing incarceration rates for the five most populous counties in the state, based on data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Harris County had a rate of 234 inmates per 100,000, while the four less-populous counties had rates between 152 and 233 people per 100,000. Edmonson also included a link to a Washington Post fact-check stating the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, and a link to the website of The Sentencing Project listing Texas as having the seventh highest incarceration rate in the country. Harris County, he said, has the highest prison and state jail rate of the five largest counties in the state, as determined by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. "In other words," Edmonson wrote, "Harris County sends the most people to prison and state jail -- in the state with the seventh-highest incarceration -- in the country with the highest incarceration rate." Checking with TDCJ With Edmonson’s reply in our pocket, we looked to verify figures on our own. First, we checked with TDCJ to see how Harris County’s incarceration rate compares nationally and with other counties in Texas, focusing on the agency’s 2014 annual statistical report tallying newly incarcerated people (receives) and each facility’s on-hand population, which provides a closer look at the incarcerated population on Aug. 31, 2014, all by county of conviction. The data reflect populations in state prisons, state jails and substance abuse felony punishment facilities. By phone, we asked Jason Clark, the director of TDCJ, what the different charts represented in the agency’s report, and which would be most accurate for reflecting each county’s incarcerated population in state facilities. Clark described the on-hand population as the best overall measure, as "new receives," only show the newly admitted population. He added one caveat — the counties listed show where a person was convicted, not necessarily where that person lived before or where that person is being detained. So, according to TDCJ, Harris County’s incarceration rate in state facilities in 2014, the most recent year published, was 599 inmates per 100,000 residents, or 26,647 inmates. By rate alone, that ranked Harris County 134th out of Texas’ 254 counties. However, there are many other prisoners held in local jailhouses. So we turned to the Texas Commission on Jail Standards, which regulates county jails and municipal lockups. The commission’s monthly incarceration rate report reflects the average daily population of county jail inmates, based on a 12-month average of one-day snapshots, taken the first day of each month. According to the commission’s September 2014 report, Harris County in 2014 had a rate of 196.6 inmates per 100,000 residents, or 8,731 inmates in county and municipal lockups. Looking strictly at incarceration rates, regardless of the relative population of different counties, Harris County placed 169th in the state. By adding figures from both sources of data, we get a fuller picture of the number of people behind bars in Harris County, regardless of whether they are in a county jail or state prison. That gives Harris County a 2014 incarceration rate of 796 inmates per 100,000 residents, or 35,378 people who were in county jail, state jail, prison or substance abuse facilities. If we include federal prison inmates, the overall rate increases to 816 per 100,000 residents, or 36,234 people. U.S., world incarceration rates For the same year, the total United States’ incarceration rate was 716 per 100,000, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that advocates against what it calls mass criminalization policies. Worldwide, the Institute for Criminal Policy Research, a London-based nonprofit that conducts research on crime and criminal justice issues, calculated an incarceration rate of 144 per 100,000, based on United Nations data. That is, Harris County had a total incarceration rate exceeding both the world and U.S. rates. There are some Texas-centric wrinkles, however. Out of the five most populous Texas counties, Harris County’s rate came in second place for 2014. Dallas County had an overall incarceration rate of 913 inmates per 100,000, or 23,006 inmates. And far less populous counties had even higher rates. Notably, Kenedy County in South Texas ranked first in the state with an overall rate of 5,000 people per 100,000 residents, though the county accounted for a grand total of 20 inmates. At the time, Kenedy County was home to 400 residents; Harris County’s population was 4.4 million. Experts comment For guidance, we checked with two independent criminal justice experts. Peter Wagner directs the Prison Policy Initiative, which studies incarceration rates closely and often is called upon to explain such figures. Michele Dietch, a senior lecturer in the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, has worked on criminal justice issues since the late 1980s. Wagner said the initiative’s global report, which folds in U.S. states with other countries to make state-to-country incarceration rate comparisons, leaves out countries with populations of less than 500,000. Smaller countries could prove distracting in discussing how the United States differs from its peers, he said. According to the report, Texas had a 2014 incarceration rate of 1,063 per 100,000, which was the fifth highest in the world. Louisiana ranked No. 1 internationally; its rate was 1,341 inmates per 100,000 residents. Louisiana’s population of 4.6 million, according to 2015 Census figures, is comparable to Harris County’s population of 4.5 million for the same time period. The report includes federal prison populations in state incarceration rate calculations, since "state politics certainly influence whether and where federal prisons are built." Mississippi, Oklahoma and Georgia also topped Texas, with rates ranging from 1,074 to 1,155 inmates per 100,000 residents. Among countries, the U.S. had the highest rate, 716 prisoners per 100,000 residents. Since we began our research, the PPI came out with a new 2016 global incarceration rate report. While rates have changed (Texas went from a rate of 1,063 inmates per 100,000 to 890), rankings have more or less remained the same. Texas ranks eighth in the world, Louisiana is now second after Washington, D.C. and the United States is still the first country to appear on the list with a rate of 693 per 100,000. Dietch told us by phone that she sees value in both per capita rates and raw counts. Per capita rates, she said, are the best way to make comparisons because they adjust for what can be vast differences in population. "Per capita rates equalize comparisons across jurisdictions of different sizes," she wrote in a follow-up email. "Otherwise, big jurisdictions will always look worse in terms of absolute numbers." But, she said, there’s value in looking at absolute numbers, since jurisdictions contributing the largest numbers of inmates will have "by far the biggest impact on the system." That is, rural Kenedy County may have the state’s highest incarceration rate and may be sending a higher share of its residents into the criminal justice system, Dietch said, yet its share of all state prisoners remains negligible. "Those absolute numbers — not the rates — are one of the key drivers of the size of the incarcerated population," she said via email. "And none of this even begins to take into account issues such as the length of sentences, another key driver of incarceration trends in Texas." "You need to look at both to understand," she said. She explained one of the main reasons a smaller county may have a higher incarceration rate lies in the lack of local sentencing alternatives including support programs, substance abuse treatment or electronic monitoring. People end up in prison or jail, Dietch said, because there isn’t much else as an alternative. In contrast, she said, urban communities like Harris County have more options to keep people out of jail and prison, she said. Our ruling Ellis said Harris County has some of the highest jailing and incarceration rates in the U.S. and the world. Harris County's rate -- calculated as the number of inmates per 100,000 residents -- exceeds the rates for the United States and world though we found jurisdictions including Dallas County with higher rates. To be fair, though, Ellis didn’t say Harris County’s rate is the highest, only that it’s among the highest. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14206	Says professional football coach Rex Ryan "won championships in New York. The AFC, I think, twice."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-praises-rex-ryans-imaginary-afc-champ/	Sometimes politicians make our jobs too easy. This is one of those times. At a rally in New York ahead of that state’s primary, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump was introduced by Buffalo Bills football coach Rex Ryan. "There's so many things I admire about Mr. Trump, but one thing I really admire about him is, you know what, he'll say what's on his mind," Ryan told the crowd. "But so many times, you'll see people, a lot of people want to say the same thing. But there's a big difference. They don't have the courage to say it. They all think it, but they don't have the courage to say it." When it was Trump’s turn to talk, he repaid Ryan with a compliment. "You know, he won championships in New York," Trump said. "The AFC, I think, twice." Ryan has coached seven years in New York, six with the New York Jets (who technically play their games in New Jersey) and one with the Bills. He has a career coaching record of 58 wins and 61 losses. And, he has never won the AFC championship -- the winner of which goes on to the Super Bowl. Ryan’s teams lost in the AFC championship game both in 2009-10 (Indianapolis Colts 30, Jets 17) and in 2010-11 (Pittsburgh Steelers 24, Jets 19). Just to round this out, Ryan hasn’t won a division championship in New York, nor did he ever play on a New York team that won a championship. This claim rates False. Correction: The Colts made up an 11-point deficit to beat the Jets in the 2009-10 AFC Championship. We apologize for listing the wrong team in an earlier version of this fact-check, and for rubbing salt in the wounds of Jets fans. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3545a6ac-cb46-461f-a52e-3723ab604886	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-04-20T13:18:34	2016-04-18	['New_York_City', 'Rex_Ryan']
pomt-13670	Says Milwaukee County district attorney candidate Verona Swanigan "has worked as a prosecutor."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/04/milwaukeeans-self-governance/candidate-district-attorney-doesnt-say-she-worked-/	A third-party radio ad supporting Verona Swanigan, a lawyer who is trying to unseat 10-year Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm, claims Swanigan "has worked as a prosecutor." That would be a key credential, given that Swanigan is trying to become the county’s top prosecutor by winning the two-way Democratic primary on Aug. 9, 2016. No Republican is running. But although she worked with prosecutors in the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office in California, even Swanigan doesn’t say she worked as a prosecutor. Neither does the office. What the ad says The ad is sponsored by Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance, which the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has described as a secretive group led by longtime conservative political operative Craig Peterson. In the April 2016 City of Milwaukee elections, the group ran attack ads against Mayor Tom Barrett, who easily won re-election, and backed the opponents of at least two Milwaukee aldermen, both of whom were re-elected. Swanigan’s latest campaign finance report, filed in July 2016, says Peterson printed $476 worth of campaign brochures for her. Her previous report says Peterson contributed $250 to her campaign and provided $1,681 in printing and food and beverages for a Swanigan fundraiser. The ad makes several attacks on Chisholm before making the claim we’re checking. It was included in this section: "Verona Swanigan is licensed to practice law in five states, holds a master’s degree in forensic psychology, has worked as a prosecutor, and a probation and parole officer, and she is the daughter of a 32-year veteran of the Milwaukee Police Department. She has never lost a trial. The current DA has never even taken a bar exam." (The Journal Sentinel reported that in the only Wisconsin felony case Swanigan ever tried, a jury found her client not guilty of sexual assault of a child. As for the allusion to Chisholm, graduates of the University of Wisconsin Law School and Marquette University Law School do not have to take the bar exam to practice law in Wisconsin. Chisholm is a UW law graduate.) As for the claim we’re checking, Peterson told us that while employed by the Fresno DA, Swanigan "filed cases, extradition motions and documentation," and made court appearances, which sounds like some of the things prosecutors do. What they say Fresno County Assistant District Attorney Steve Wright told us Swanigan was classified as a legal assistant/paralegal when she worked in the office from March to December 2006. He said he did not know her job duties, but that she was not a sworn prosecutor. Swanigan had earned her law degree from Northern Illinois University in 2005, but hadn’t yet passed the California bar exam when she was hired in Fresno. She said that under the program she worked in, she filed criminal complaints, although they were done in the name of a sworn prosecutor; and made court appearances on her own, though under the supervision of a prosecutor. Unlike Peterson, Swanigan said she would not call herself a former prosecutor. "I personally would not describe it that way," Swanigan told us, referring to the ad. "He could make a legal argument for it to be described that way, but I would not." Indeed, the biographical section of Swanigan’s campaign website says she worked at the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office, but no position is listed. Our rating Milwaukeeans for Self-Governance says in a radio ad that Swanigan "has worked as a prosecutor." Swanigan made court appearances and assisted prosecutors in other ways when she worked in the the Fresno County District Attorney’s Office in California. But she was classified as a paralegal, not a sworn prosecutor, and does not describe herself as a former prosecutor. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07039	"Since I took office, we’ve created 76,800 jobs."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-touts-better-job-numbers-sign-succe/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott, who campaigned on a promise to create 700,000 jobs over seven years, routinely touts the state's progress. A classic Scott-ism: "This is a contest to make our state the No. 1 place to do business, and that's what I'm going to do." So on June 17, 2011, the day Florida released its jobs numbers for May, Scott released this statement: "Florida is leading the nation in job creation and our unemployment rate has dropped for the fifth straight month, a huge win for Floridians. It is unfortunate the federal government can’t say the same thing for the rest of the country. "Our efforts to make Florida the most business friendly state are clearly paying off and we are bucking the national trend. "Since I took office, we’ve created 76,800 jobs for parents, recent graduates, workforce veterans and all Floridians who have been struggling to get back on their feet. "Texas is still leading the country in job growth this year, but Florida is trailing right behind at number two. We are gunning to be the number one state for job growth and I will not rest until Florida surpasses Texas for the top spot." Whether Florida led the nation in job creation in May is the subject of a separate fact-check. Here, we'll take a look at another of Scott's claims, that since he took office Jan. 4, "we've created 76,800 jobs." (Scott repeated the claim on July 1 during a speech to the Florida Society of News Editors.) We checked in with Scott's press secretary, Lane Wright, and Florida's Agency for Workforce Innovation, which among other things prepares labor statistics for the state. The 76,800 job figure quickly checked out. Scott used a mainstream estimate from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics: "total nonfarm employment" that had been "seasonally adjusted." Farms are commonly excluded because that workforce swings so dramatically. And it's helpful to look at estimates that have been "seasonally adjusted" because formulas make up for differences between months such as the number of weeks, holidays and seasonal employment patterns. Now, in our fact-check of the May numbers, we point out that some economists caution about relying too heavily on seasonally adjusted numbers right now. The jobs world has been so turbulent, it's very difficult to adjust for "normal" seasonal swings. So they also take a look at estimates that haven't been seasonally adjusted — the ones based directly on a survey of about 140,000 U.S. employers each month. Remember that these estimates don't account for things like number of weeks or holidays in a particular month — or seasonal shifts such Florida's tourist season — and so aren't considered a good way to compare change between months or over time. But in pursuit of a fuller picture, we checked the non-seasonally adjusted numbers, as well, and found they work in Scott's favor: Instead of showing 76,800 more jobs than when he took office in January, it showed 119,700 more jobs. So not only does Scott accurately cite federal statistics, looking at the numbers a second way still supports his underlying message -- Florida is creating jobs. But we're not done. At PolitiFact, we look at statistical claims like this one in two parts: 1.) Have jobs increased by 76,800 under Gov. Rick Scott? (By one official measure, they have.) 2.) Is Scott responsible? As University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith put it, "The numbers are easily verifiable. ... What I guess is implied is who's responsible for the creation of those jobs." Scott also invited this question when he added, "Our efforts to make Florida the most business friendly state are clearly paying off." We wondered: Already? As you might have guessed, this is where things get trickier. (And there's some fun journalism out there about whether politicians can really take credit.) First, Scott has only just started to implement his agenda. Should he get credit for jobs in January? In February? A small decrease to the corporate income tax passed this legislative session, for example — less than 1/10th of what Scott sought — but has yet to add any money to employers' bottom line. Second, it's too soon to identify a trend. "It is far too early to tell whether Gov. Scott's policies are having any effect on jobs in Florida," said David Denslow, an economist at University of Florida. He pointed out that recent history shows huge swoops in job creation — way, way up since 1990, with some leveling off in the early 2000s, then another climb, then the familiar sickening dive marking the Great Recession. The few jobs added since January 2011 barely register as a change on that roller coaster ride. So it's impossible to see yet whether there's a positive trend since then, he said. Third, Florida was projected to start adding jobs no matter who took office. In the 2011-12 fiscal year, for example, state economists have estimated we'll add 130,500 jobs, then 175,000 the year after, with diminishing but hefty additions as years pass. (In other words, if the governor who campaigned on a promise to create 700,000 jobs over seven years takes credit for every job created, he'll meet the goal easily. But if they would have happened without him, can you give him credit for creating them? We'll weigh this issue as we decide how to measure his promise on our Scott-O-Meter.) "There's one thing you can't criticize about Gov. Scott, and that's his sense of timing," Snaith said. "He's coming into office at the perfect time on a platform of job creation. You couldn't time it better." Now, Scott does get some credit from economists for marketing the state for business, something he's done ever since he was elected in November 2010. Snaith of the University of Central Florida and Mark Vitner, an economist with Wells Fargo, noted that he's worked to get the word out that his policies will be pro-business. And taking a hard line on the state budget showed he'll act on his platform, Vitner said. "He's pretty much stuck to his word since he's been in office," Vitner said. "I think that gives businesses some confidence that they've got a partner." So where does that leave us? Scott got the number right, sticking to mainstream federal statistics. But he jumped the gun and overreached in claiming credit for those jobs. That's a pretty important clarification, and knocks him down a peg. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-01869	"We cut property taxes for seniors and our middle class."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/10/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-he-cut-property-taxes-seniors-a/	After months of campaign ads from Gov. Rick Scott, Charlie Crist began rolling out his own commercials in this year’s gubernatorial race. In the first, entitled "Sunshine," Crist hearkened back to his single term as governor, from 2007 to 2011. "We saved the jobs of 20,000 teachers," he said. "We cut property taxes for seniors and our middle class." We’ve dealt with Crist’s track record with teachers' jobs before, but what about his history on property taxes? PolitiFact Florida decided to send you a notice a few months before your bill is due in November. Break for seniors Crist’s campaign pointed us to two events that happened during his term to prove its point. One was the 2007 legislation HB 333, a bill the Legislature passed that increased the homestead exemption for low-income seniors. It was the law that implemented Amendment 6, which voters had approved in 2006. HB 333 increased the maximum homestead exemption from $25,000 to $50,000 for seniors whose income was less than $23,414, if local governments allowed it. Crist signed the bill during his first legislative session in April 2007. While running for governor, he had broadly campaigned on lowering the property tax burden on senior citizens, saying the state’s booming economy would make up the difference. The exemption applied to cities and counties, not to school districts or special districts. By the time Crist approved the law, 53 counties and 158 cities had already approved an increased exemption, but the law allowed them to increase it up to $50,000 for 2007. Break for middle class The second item was the 2008 passage of Amendment 1, a constitutional change aimed at giving longtime Florida residents a break on ever-escalating property taxes. We should note that Crist says the break was for "our middle class," but doesn’t define the term. Most homeowners saw some benefit, no matter what their income level. The amendment increased the homestead exemption, saving homeowners an average of $240 on property taxes annually. It also allowed homeowners to transfer their tax benefits to a new residence (including benefits from the 1992 Save Our Homes tax provisions). The amendment further created a new $25,000 exemption for some business properties and limited assessment increases for non-homesteaded properties to 10 percent annually. Crist was a very vocal supporter of the measure, campaigning on the plan during the 2006 election. He frequently said taxes would "drop like a rock" under Amendment 1. Opposition came from newer residents who wouldn’t enjoy the benefits in the same way as long-term owners. Florida TaxWatch said it was potentially unconstitutional, and even state Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink worried about state fire-fighting agencies, among other departments, losing funding. Despite this opposition, the amendment passed on Jan. 29, 2008, with 64 percent of the vote. The 2008 Legislature fully implemented it with SB 1588, which Crist signed on June 17. We should note critics had reason to be wary of the change, especially because of the timing. The amendment made beneficiaries happy but wreaked havoc on state tax revenues, combined with the Great Recession’s crashing real estate market, which wiped out billions in taxable home values. Drastic budget cuts resulted in reduced services statewide. The bill was originally projected to save homeowners $1.3 billion the first year, but it’s unlikely the tax benefits amounted to that much because of property values declining in 2008 and later years. Experts told us an analysis to find out how much less would have to go parcel by parcel, taking into account taxable values and changes in local millage rates. The Republican Party of Florida has been saying that Crist actually raised taxes on the middle class $2.2 billion while in office. That actually came a year later, when he and the Republican-led Legislature raised taxes and fees, like $1 a pack tax on cigarettes, to close a budget hole in 2009. Other fees were increased on auto tags and fishing licenses. Were the property tax cuts outweighed by the later tax increases of 2009? It’s nearly impossible to quantify the impact on an average taxpayer, because it would depend on if an individual owned property, smoked cigarettes, owned a car or fished. Our ruling Crist said, "we cut property taxes for seniors and our middle class." Crist supported increased homestead exemptions for seniors, although only those considered low income. He also supported tax cuts for property owning residents, but not just an undefined middle class. Voters decided on both issues with constitutional amendments, and the state Legislature did its part by passing bills that Crist signed. Crist’s claim doesn’t specify the nuances, but property tax cuts for groups falling under those umbrellas did happen during his term. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11319	New York has "among the highest tax burdens of any state in the nation"	true	/new-york/statements/2018/apr/12/marcus-molinaro/do-ny-residents-have-among-highest-tax-burdens-mol/	A Republican who wants to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo this year says New York state residents face one of the highest tax burdens in the country. Dutchess County Executive Marcus Molinaro said Cuomo hasn’t done enough to lower taxes during his first two terms as governor. "I can imagine he wants to talk about anything but his last seven years in office and certainly the fact that we have among the highest tax burdens of any state in the nation," Molinaro said to reporters in Albany. Molinaro wants to cut property taxes by reducing state mandated spending for counties, like Medicaid. The state would absorb that spending without raising taxes by cutting costs elsewhere. Cuomo has limited rising property taxes by capping how much local governments can raise them. PolitiFact New York rated as Mostly True the governor's claim that he's cut income taxes to the lowest rates in 70 years for middle-class New York state earners. So where New York state ranks in the nation for tax burden could change in coming years. But is Molinaro right? Do New York state residents still have among the highest tax burdens in the country now? Tax burden data To support the claim, a Molinaro spokesperson pointed to a New York Post article that relied on data and analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation. The group found the state's residents spent, on average, 12.7 percent of their income on state and local taxes, "the highest burden in the nation." But there's a caveat: The data's from 2012. More recent analysis from the Tax Foundation shows New York state ranked second in the nation for the amount of all state and local taxes collected per capita -- $8,722 -- in 2016. That includes property, income, sales and corporate taxes among others. Only North Dakota had a higher amount. For state and local income taxes alone, New York state ranked highest in the nation for the amount collected per capita -- $2,789 -- in 2015, according to the latest data from the Tax Foundation. For property taxes, New York state ranked fourth in the nation for the amount collected per capita -- $2,697 -- in 2015. The state has some of the highest local property taxes in the country. "Looking at all of the available metrics, some of this is of course driven by New York being a relatively high-income state," said John Buhl, a spokesperson for the Tax Foundation. "Nevertheless, by most measures, New York is one of the highest taxed states in the country." Other things to consider Per capita rates look at the total amount of tax revenue collected in a state divided by that state’s population. That doesn’t consider the number of wealthy earners and high-value homes in New York state, which inflate the revenue collected by state and local governments. New York state has the third-highest number of millionaires in the country, and those earners are taxed at a higher rate than in most states. The state also has the second-highest number of homes worth more than $2 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. New York state ranks 14th in property taxes as a share of the state’s average home value. New York state "does have a lot of very wealthy people, companies and buildings," said Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax research organization. "All that wealth contributes to New York’s high tax revenue, even before we discuss tax rates and the tax liability of residents." Auxier co-authored a report that showed New York state relied more on property and income tax revenue than an average state in 2012. New York state relied on property taxes more than most states in particular. But the state also provides generous tax credits to low- and middle-income families. Our ruling Molinaro said New York state has "among the highest tax burdens of any state in the nation." The Tax Foundation analysis shows New York state ranks among the highest for per capita collections of income and property taxes. Since Cuomo took office in January 2011, New York state has cut income tax rates and capped property tax increases. The changes could affect future rankings. But Molinaro’s claim is accurate. The tax burden for the state's residents remains among the highest in the nation. We rate it True.

pomt-08602	Children born today will carry a $30,000 share of the national debt.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/23/citizens-republic/mourning-america-ad-echoing-reagan-classic-gets-it/	On Sept. 21, 2010, a group called Citizens for the Republic unveiled a television ad called "Mourning in America," that mirrored, right down to its understated visuals and narration, a famous Ronald Reagan ad from his 1984 re-election campaign titled "Morning in America." Whereas the original ad exuded confidence and pride in the United States under Reagan's leadership, the new version -- aired by a group run by veterans of the Reagan administration -- presented a bleak look at the current state of the economy and a tone of sadness about the country's seemingly diminished prospects. "There's mourning in America," the ad begins. "Today, 15 million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work. Businesses shuttered. Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall. This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married, each of their children to be born with a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt." We won't judge whether these statistics support the idea that the country is "fading," that President Barack Obama's policy has "failed" or the ad's exhortation to vote for a "smaller, more caring government." But we will look at each of the statistics mentioned in the ad. (The ad was put together by Fred Davis, a leading Republican ad-man. We discuss some of the ads he made this year in a story posted today.) • "Fifteen million men and women won't have the opportunity to go to work." According to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, there were 14.9 million unemployed Americans in August. Close enough for us. • "Twenty-nine hundred families will have their homes foreclosed by nightfall." According to RealtyTrac, the leading authority on foreclosure statistics, "lenders foreclosed on 95,364 U.S. properties in August (2010), the highest monthly total in the history of the report." If you divide that total by 31 days, you get 3,076 foreclosures per day. That's actually a little more than the ad indicates. • "This afternoon, 6,000 men and women will be married." This statistic was presumably included so the current ad would mirror the script of the one from 1984, which cited the then-rate of 6,500 marriages per day as evidence that couples were heading optimistically into the future. Since then, marriage rates have dropped, though it's not clear how much of this is due to economic conditions, as opposed to broader social and demographic trends. The most recent figures from the National Center for Health Statistics, a federal agency, show that there were 2,077,000 marriages in 2009. Dividing this total by 365 days, you get 5,690 marriages per day. That's a little lower than what the ad says -- by about 5 percent. Also, those who are really picky may quibble that the number of marriages completed on weekdays is a lot lower than 6,000, and it's a lot higher on weekend days. Still, the ad is pretty close. • Each child born will have "a $30,000 share of the runaway national debt." At first, we were confused by this statistic because our reading of the ad's wording suggested that it should involve how many children were going to be born to couples who got married this year. But it turns out this statistic is much simpler than that. The ad writers divided the total estimate for the public debt at the end of 2010 ($9,297,653,000,000) by the total U.S. population (307,006,550) and came out with $30,286 for every man, woman and child. In a recent item, we discussed the relative merits of two different measures for the national debt. One is debt held by the public (which the makers of "Mourning in America" used, and the other is that amount plus debt held by the government, typically in trust funds for major government programs, including Social Security and Medicare. When we asked economists for their opinion of which measurement is more relevant, each of the two statistics had its fans, so we concluded that both are legitimate measurements. For completeness, we'll note here that using the larger figure, called gross federal debt, the per-person debt load would be just shy of $45,000, which would only make the ad's argument stronger. Put it all together and you have four statistics that are all very, very close to being accurate. So we rate the facts in the ad True.

pomt-08867	Jeff Greene on why he went Cuba.	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/aug/04/jeff-greene/jeff-greenes-cuba-trip-business-or-pleasure/	Jeff Greene says one of his political idols was the first U.S. senator he remembers while growing up in Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy. Well, like Kennedy, Greene's got a Cuba problem. The billionaire candidate running as a Democrat for U.S. Senate got into trouble on Aug. 1, 2010, when he was forced to answer questions about why his 145-foot-yacht Summerwind docked in a Havana marina in 2007. Knowing that Cuba travel is a delicate issue in South Florida Cuban American communities, we decided to review Greene's statements on the matter. Our tool for this analysis is the Flip-O-Meter, which measures how consistent a candidate has been. Aug. 1, 2010, debate In a televised debate with Bay News 9 in Tampa Bay and CFN 13 in Orlando taped on Aug. 1 and aired the next night, Greene said he stood firmly in support of the U.S. embargo of Cuba. The statement gave opponent U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek an opportunity to bring up a recent St. Petersburg Times story that said Greene went on his yacht to Cuba, and that crew members recalled extensive partying. Greene said he wasn't there. (Watch the entire exchange here). "I don't know if I need to slide my chair over, because a bolt of lightning may come in and hit Jeff,'' Meek said. "You're saying you weren't on your yacht, when it went to Cuba and eyewitnesses said you were on the yacht?" "No," Greene responded. "I went to Cuba years ago on a Jewish mission to Cuba, yes, for the Jewish community." "Were you on the yacht when it was reported …" Meek pressed. "No, not that time … I was not on the yacht on the trip you're talking about. I was on the yacht on another time when I had a visa to go there and visit the Jewish community," Greene stammered as Meek cross-examined him. To recap the exchange, Greene said that he wasn't on the boat during the trip mentioned in the story (the 2007 "party" trip) but that he did visit Cuba another time, had a visa and did humanitarian work in the Jewish community. We'll call that version No. 1. Hours later Immediately after the debate, Greene acknowledged he may have gone to Cuba in 2007. Greene said the Jewish Federation had obtained a visa for him to visit Cuba, the St. Petersburg Times reported, and that he and other members of the federation visited a synagogue. No partying though. "Who would you party with?" he quipped. Recapping Greene's revised recollection, the 2007 trip that Greene said he wasn't on, he now says he may have been on. But there was no partying, and Greene was there on a humanitarian mission to visit the country's Jewish synagogues. Let's call that version No. 2. Later in the week On Aug. 3, as more questions kept coming about the Cuba trip, the partying -- a deck hand reported the boat being "caked" in vomit from all the partying -- and Greene's humanitarian mission, spokesman Luis Vizcaino clarified that Greene's yacht stopped at a Havana marina in 2007 not for a party, and not for a humanitarian mission, but because the Summerwind was in need of repairs. "During the debate Jeff misspoke," Vizcaino said. "What he meant to say was that in 2007, he went on the boat from Honduras to the Bahamas, and en route the boat had a hydraulic problem. … The captain said we could wait for the part at Hemingway Marina." While docked in Havana, Greene went to visit a synagogue because he had heard about a Jewish humanitarian mission. "He didn't meet up with them," Vizcaino said. "He wanted to observe. … What he came away with was firsthand knowledge of the plight of the country." Vizcaino, when asked about the Jewish Federation visa, said of Greene, "again, he misspoke." The Greene campaign produced a letter from the Summerwind's chief engineer corroborating the campaign's latest thoughts -- the boat malfunctioned on the way to the Bahamas, went to see a Cuban synagogue while we waited -- which we're calling version No. 3. Another crew member disputes that version of events in comments to the St. Petersburg Times. We should also note that the Greene press release on Aug. 4 attempting to clarify the trip said that "Jeff and his then-fiancee, now wife, were en route to Honduras," which means headed to Honduras, which is the opposite of what Greene, Vizcaino and the chief engineer say happened. That's at least three significantly different versions of one story, crafted in three days. First Greene wasn't on the trip, then he said he was -- but that it was a humanitarian trip. Then the trip was a detour because of hydraulic issues. Our definition of a Full Flop is "A major reversal of position; a complete flip-flop." In this case, that sounds just right. We rate Greene's statements on whether and why he went to Cuba a Full Flop.	None	Jeff Greene	None	None	None	2010-08-04T18:02:35	2010-08-03	['Cuba']
pomt-08690	Says Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mark-neumann-nancy-pelosi/	Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker’s new statewide TV ad hits the trifecta, touching on three hot-buttons issues in this election cycle: transportation spending, earmarks and ties to a Democratic Party whose popularity has sagged. In a direct-mail piece, radio ad and TV spot, Walker mocks GOP rival Mark Neumann’s claim that he is a true conservative and Washington outsider crusading against wasteful spending. Following a national Republican strategy of tying Democratic candidates to U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Walker aims to do the same with Republican Neumann, who served two terms in Congress in the 1990s. Is the Neumann-Pelosi comparison accurate? Let’s focus on the TV ad, which echoes the approach on the radio and in direct mail. It features a crude hand puppet figure of Neumann, his eyes shifting. It ticks off a series of complaints, all focused on a single 1998 vote on a controversial transportation spending bill: "Mark Neumann says he’s against big government spending," the ad begins. "But in 1998, Congressman Neumann voted for one of the largest transportation bills in history. A bill that contained $9 billion in pork barrel spending. Including funding for the infamous bridge to nowhere. And a highway in Canada. You know who else voted for that $9 billion in pork barrel spending? Nancy Pelosi." As a Pelosi puppet pops out from behind Neumann, the narrator says: "Take a closer look at Mark Neumann. Remind you of anyone?" (Note: On Sept. 8, the Walker campaign changed the ending of the ad to say Neumann's excuse for the vote was that lots of others voted for it, too. The ad retained the Pelosi image. A new direct mail piece continued to use the "remind you of anyone?" line.) With the Sept. 14 primary approaching, Walker is also running a second radio ad, making a similar link based on a different bill. The point of the ads is more sweeping than comparing individual votes. Walker is likening Neumann to Pelosi. So in this item, we'll be examining whether he is correct to equate them. Neumann did join Pelosi and 295 other House members in backing the transportation bill. There were 86 votes against it. The exact tally: 143 Republicans in favor, 56 against. On the Democratic side, 153 supported and 30 voted no. One independent voted aye, according to congressional records. The bill was described by the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post as the largest transportation legislation in history. Media accounts also scored the bill as one of the most pork-laden of all time, funding $9 billion in "special projects." Critics and defenders argued over the need for many of them. The most famous, of course, was the "bridge to nowhere"in Alaska -- a familiar topic to political watchers. A big majority of both parties voted for the bill. In the Wisconsin delegation, three Republicans supported it, and one was opposed. Among state Democrats, three supported it and two voted no (including Tom Barrett, now running for governor). Their reasons were all over the map, creating a list of strange bedfellows. For instance, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Menomonee Falls) opposed the bill. But then-House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) -- a prominent conservative -- supported it, along with Neumann. Armey is now a leader of the tea party movement. How wide-ranging was the bill? Scott Walker himself, then a member of the state Assembly, applauded a piece of it -- sponsored by U.S. Rep. Tom Petri (R-Fond du Lac) -- that lifted a requirement that $241 million in federal money be used on either a light rail system or freeway bus and car-pool lanes in the East-West Corridor between Milwaukee and Waukesha. Walker spoke up in the week after the bill passed, as the leader of a bipartisan group of six Milwaukee County lawmakers. The ad is correct in stating Neumann voted for the measure. Neumann said he liked a provision in the bill that assured the federal share of the gas tax wouldn’t be used for other purposes. The legislation included a "minimum guarantee," according to a U.S. House committee report, to make sure states received more funding. Now let’s look at the Neumann and Pelosi comparison. Walker’s campaign says the ad does not try to tag Pelosi and Neumann as kindred voters, except for on this particular vote. But that is the implication of the ad. And it’s a reach. Pelosi, House speaker since January 2007, was not in a leadership position at the time. In fact, Republicans controlled the chamber. On most important votes involving spending and taxes, Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, and Neumann, who represented southern Wisconsin, were polar opposites. During his four years in Congress from 1995 to 1998, Neumann earned an "A" grade from the National Taxpayers Union, a group that believes taxpayers are overburdened and pushes for reforms in the federal tax system. During those same years, Pelosi earned an "F." The group says an "A" indicates the legislator is "one of the strongest supporters of responsible tax and spending policies." By contrast, an "F" means the lawmaker is a "big spender." We turned to the Washington Post’s database of votes to sample Neumann and Pelosi’s record in the 105th Congress, the one in which the 1998 vote occurred. Of the 17 pieces of legislation deemed most prominent, Neumann and Pelosi agreed on six. The bills included four appropriations measures, an IRS reform bill and the transportation bill. On the six, Congress was nearly unanimous in approving three. In all but one -- an appropriations bill -- Neumann voted with the GOP majority. All told, in the 105th Congress, Pelosi voted with her party 89.9 percent of the time, the Post data shows. Neumann voted with Republicans on 86.6 percent, the Post data shows. So, where does that leave us? Walker’s claims on Neumann’s support of the transportation bill are accurate. The vote involved a major spending bill that drew a lot of attention, and Neumann does not dispute he supported it. But the ad suggests something much larger, that Neumann and Pelosi are somehow ideologically matched. Based on the ratings from an outside group and the lawmakers’ voting record, the two rarely lined up. Indeed, by the standard of linking them on a single vote, Neumann could as easily have been paired with Armey as Pelosi. Using Walker’s logic, Walker could have linked himself to Pelosi. After all, he supported a provision in the bill at the time. Walker wouldn’t agree with that comparison. And we don’t agree with the Neumann-Pelosi one. We rate the connection False.

pomt-13804	"There are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/jeff-sessions/senator-jeff-sessions-says-about-350000-people-suc/	U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., spoke about jobs, wages and immigrant workers on the first night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Sessions said that when more workers come into the United States than there are jobs available, job prospects and wages fall. And when it comes to illegal immigration, "there are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year," Sessions said in his speech. We wondered if that number was right. We reached out to Sessions’ office for data supporting his statement but did not hear back. We found a Dec. 22, 2015, border security report by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security detailing apprehensions by fiscal year. The federal government’s fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. In fiscal year 2015, Border Patrol tallied 337,117 apprehensions nationwide, a decrease from 486,651 in fiscal year 2014 — and almost 80 percent below apprehension peaks in 2000, according to the federal report. "Illegal migration, as defined by total Border Patrol apprehensions, continues to reflect an overall decline compared to the peak in 2000," the report said. Other sources point to apprehension levels hovering around Sessions’ 350,000 estimates, though they also find such numbers to be in decline. A report issued in 2013 by the National Foundation for American Policy, a think tank focused on trade and immigration, analyzed U.S. Border Patrol data and found that in fiscal year 1999, Border Patrol had more than 1.5 million apprehensions along the Southwest border. That number dropped by fiscal year 2009, when border patrol counted 540,865 apprehensions, according to the think tank. It was even lower by fiscal year 2012, with 356,873 apprehensions, NFAP found. But Sessions said that 350,000 "succeed in crossing our border." The apprehension numbers represent people who did not succeed. At any rate, the falling apprehension statistics were part of NFAP study, which found that "the rise in immigrant deaths comes at a time when fewer people are attempting to enter illegally, as measured by the significant drop in apprehensions at the border over the past several years." Border apprehension data is what is frequently used as a measure of illegal entry, though it represents events, not individuals, the Department of Homeland Security notes. As a result, apprehension numbers during a specific period will be more than total number of unique individuals, because some immigrants may be apprehended more than once, the department points out. An analysis by Pew Research Center published in 2015 also shows that in recent years, more Mexican immigrants have gone back to Mexico from the United States than have actually come into the country. That means the number of immigrants illegally in the country is staying the same or getting smaller. Stephen R. Kelly, a visiting professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, considers Sessions' statistic too high, even though no one knows exactly how many people illegally enter the United States every year, he said. "Sen. Sessions' statistic is undoubtedly too high, and ignores the larger trend of sharply dropping illegal immigration to the U.S.," Kelly said via email. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, also says Session’s figure is probably too high, pointing to border patrol data that says apprehension figures are declining. "If the stock of illegals is constant and the percentage of them who are coming legally and overstaying is increasing, then the number coming across the border must have fallen," Nowrasteh said in an email. Our ruling Sessions said, "There are about 350,000 people who succeed in crossing our borders illegally each year." The most common way federal officials track illegal entry is border apprehensions. In fiscal year 2015, the border patrol had 337,117 apprehensions nationwide, a decline from previous fiscal year and a significant drop from peaks in 2000. But those numbers represent people who are unsuccessful in crossing the border. Sessions said the opposite. Also apprehension numbers do not necessarily represent number of people crossing borders, since they track events, not individuals, according to Department of Homeland Security. The number of immigrants illegally in the country is staying the same or getting smaller.

pomt-00218	Says Tony Evers will "raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/11/scott-walker/mixed-evidence-scott-walker-claim-rival-tony-evers/	When Scott Walker put out a TV ad reviving a skit from "The Electric Company," a 1970s children’s television show that co-starred Morgan Freeman, Mashable snarkily called it "one of the most bizarre campaign ads of 2018." The ad aims to win the Republican governor a third term in the Nov. 6, 2018 election. It features silhouettes of a woman and a man facing each other. They take turns claiming that Walker’s Democratic challenger, state schools superintendent Tony Evers, would raise taxes. But there is a more conventional ad -- where Walker makes a similar, but more specific claim on Evers and taxes -- that we want to fact check. In that spot, released Sept. 20, 2018, Walker begins by saying: "With all the attack ads, it’s easy to forget" things in Wisconsin he likes to highlight, such as low unemployment and high-performing schools. Then Walker himself attacks, saying: "Tony Evers? Well, he’ll raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon." Walker has made claims like that in three more TV ads. What’s more, similar claims are made in a TV ad from the Republican Governors Association/Right Direction Wisconsin PAC and in a TV ad from Americans for Prosperity. So, what evidence does Walker have to back his political future-telling? It’s a mix: Evers is at least opening the door to higher property taxes; he said he will raise income taxes in at least one way; and he might raise the gas tax, but he says not by $1 per gallon. But it’s also important to note that, while Evers has said he is open to tax increases, it’s not clear that he would raise all the taxes Walker says. And when it comes to property and income taxes, Evers has not expressed support for across-the-board increases. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. Raise Property taxes? Maybe Evers wants to raise limits on how much local school districts can levy in property taxes — in other words, giving school districts the ability to increase property taxes. He argues that because he also proposes increasing state aid to schools, among other factors, that will offset — at least in the aggregate — the need for any property tax increase. On the property tax side: Current law allows no per-pupil increase in local property taxes. Evers’ 2019-’21 budget request for his Department of Public Instruction calls for allowing school districts to increase local property taxes by $200 per-pupil in the first year of the budget and by $204 the second year. On the state aid side: But Evers has also called for, as part of his budget proposal, increasing state payments to schools by $1.4 billion, or 10 percent, over two years. Evers has said he could increase the aid by making cuts elsewhere in the state budget. The upshot, according to the Department of Public Instruction, is school districts with higher property wealth could their see property taxes go up, while less-wealthy districts could see property taxes go down. But the department says there would be no net increase in property taxes collected. The department provided us figures indicating that increased state aid and other factors would offset any property taxes in total during the 2019-’21 budget period. A spokesman for the department told us Evers is committed after that, when revenue limits would rise with inflation, to continue to provide enough state aid to keep property taxes flat overall. In any case, lifting the revenue limits at least opens the door to property tax increases. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Raise income taxes? Yes, in at least one way Before he secured the Democratic nomination, Evers said he wants to eliminate the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit, saying it favors the rich. His campaign has since repeated that Evers wants to eliminate the credit. Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobby, supports the credit, saying it leads to business investment and job creation. The credit, part of Walker’s first state budget in 2011, gradually reduced the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses to nearly nothing -- from 7.9 percent to 0.4 percent. (In 2017, we rated Mostly True a claim that 11 people who each make over $30 million got a total of $22 million in credits from the tax credit.) It’s also worth noting that Evers has said he is considering increasing income taxes on the wealthy and cutting income taxes for others — but adds: "There’s no definite plans at this time." So, by eliminating one tax credit, Evers would be increasing income taxes on manufacturers and agricultural businesses; and he is open to raising income taxes on the wealthy, but lowering them on others.

Maybe, but not up to $1 per gallon On Aug. 15, 2018, the day after Evers won the primary election, Walker said Evers might be willing to quadruple the state’s 32.9 cents-per-gallon state gas tax because Evers hasn't said how much he would be willing to increase it. Later that morning, a reporter asked Evers about Waker’s comment and whether he would raise the gas tax by $1. Evers responded more generally by saying: "I would support looking at anything, whether it’s removing tax credits, whether it’s slimming down state government, whether it’s gas taxes. Everything is on the table." But by the afternoon, Evers said Walker was lying about his views on the gas tax. "The only thing I ever said about that," Evers declared, "is that every possible revenue source is on the table." Evers has not said how much of an increase in the gas tax he could back. Evers has also said, in speaking about road funding, that he would consider increasing the gas tax or implementing tolls. He said he "has no range" in terms of how high of an increase in the gas tax he would consider. Evers also has said that while he is considering increasing the gas tax to pay for roads, a $1 increase was "ridiculous." So, saying Evers will raise gas taxes by up to $1 per gallon, when he has only said he would consider raising the tax some amount, goes too far. Our rating Walker says Evers will "raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon." Evers has pledged to eliminate a Walker-era manufacturing and agriculture tax credit. So, that will result in higher income taxes for those who have taken advantage of the credit. On property taxes, Evers acknowledges that his proposed budget for the state Department of Instruction could result in higher property taxes in some school districts and lower levies in others. By lifting revenue limits, however, Evers would be allowing school districts to increase property taxes. And while Evers has said he is open to raising the gas tax, he hasn’t said he would seek any particular increase and has flatly denied that it would be $1. Moreover, while Evers is open to raising taxes, it's not across-the-board, at least in the case of property and income taxes. For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Walker a Half True.

pomt-02853	The deficit this year could pay "all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/18/kelly-ayotte/ayotte-compares-size-federal-deficit-baseball-sala/	Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., talked debt and deficit with Granite Staters at a town hall meeting last month, trying to put the enormous numbers into context for the average person. The deficit could buy a large Dunkin’ Donuts coffee for every American every day for the next four years, she said. It also could pay for new iPhones for half of the people on Earth. And to really hit home the size of billions of dollars of deficit, Ayotte compared the figure with the salaries of Major League Baseball players. The deficit, she said, could pay "all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years." It was fitting timing for the comparison. Ayotte donned a Boston Red Sox hat during the town hall, held on the day of Game 2 of the 2013 World Series. It’s also an interesting statistic to cite. Could the deficit actually fund America’s favorite pastime for the next two-and-a-half centuries? We did the math. Tracking down the federal deficit was the easy part. At the time of the town hall event, the Congressional Budget Office’s most recent deficit estimate was $753 billion, from the monthly report published in September. The baseball numbers are a bit trickier to calculate. Each December, Major League Baseball calculates the total payroll of all baseball clubs to see which teams have to pay a luxury tax, incurred by those who have a payroll over the threshold set by MLB. The 2012 spending was $3.15 billion But what about 2013 figures? We struck out with both Major League Baseball and the players’ union, the Major League Baseball Players Association. The communications office said the official 2013 data is currently being calculated. So, we relied on Opening Day numbers reported by media organizations, which they attributed to a combination of the players association, club officials and Major League Baseball’s central office. According to ESPN, the sum of all the team payrolls on opening day was $3,059,073,869. USA Today and CBS Sports have similar but slightly different numbers -- $3,100,746,107 for USA Today and $3,098,746,107 for CBS Sports. The differences are generally explained by how signing bonuses and deferred money in contracts are counted, and whether injured players are included, said Jeff Euston, a baseball fan who runs a website called Cot’s Contracts at Baseball Prospectus. Ayotte’s math is accurate using the ESPN data -- the source her staff said she used. They said she used numbers reported by ESPN and divided that by the federal deficit estimated by the Office of Management and Budget in July. That’s $759 billion divided by $3,059,073,869, or 248 years. Using numbers from other media organizations, the deficit instead can pay baseball salaries for 238 years or 244 years. Meanwhile, using the CBO’s estimate from September brings the years to 236 or 242. Our Ruling: Ayotte said the deficit this year could pay "all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years." Given that she had a couple different options for data, the senator looked to ESPN for sports statistics, which seemed to us like a reasonable choice. The ESPN data produces a result of 248 years. Even if the answer is 236 years or 244 years -- the answer you get if you use different data sources -- it’s a long time. We rate her statement True.

pomt-15100	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker turned a $1 billion surplus into a $2.2 billion budget deficit.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/16/donald-trump/trump-walker-turned-1-billion-surplus-22-budget-sh/	The CNN moderators aimed to get the Republican presidential candidates to go head-to-head in the second GOP debate and the contenders complied. Frontrunner Donald Trump and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker got into verbal tussle over who had a worse fiscal track record. Walker charged that Trump had taken four projects into bankruptcy. Trump fired back that Walker had ruined his state’s budget. "You were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state," Trump said. "You lost 2.2 (billion). You have, right now, a huge budget deficit. That’s not a Democratic point. That's a point. That’s a fact." Trump is partly right on the money, but he’s mixing apples and oranges, and his use of the word deficit is problematic. PolitiFact Wisconsin covered much of the ground before. The rules By law, Wisconsin’s two-year budgets must be balanced -- revenue equalling expenditures. So, unlike the federal government, Wisconsin can never run an actual budget deficit by borrowing money that piles up as debt. That said, the state does various projections of what revenues and expenditures will be for the upcoming two-year budget cycle. Those projections can show a surplus or a deficit -- although "deficit" is more accurately termed a projected shortfall, since there is no actual red ink. But the two figures he cited were projections that received plenty of attention when they were made. The two figures In January 2014, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau projected Wisconsin would see a surplus of about $1 billion by June 30, 2015 -- the end of the 2013-15 budget cycle. At the time, revenues were coming in higher than expected. Walker and the GOP-run Legislature adopted a series of tax cuts later in 2014, making good on a Walker promise to return such surpluses to taxpayers, but drawing criticism for not using the money for other purposes, such as boosting the state’s rainy day fund. Along the way, however, tax collections grew at a slower pace than had been projected. By November 2014, there was a reversal of fortune: Walker’s own Department of Administration projected a $2.2 billion shortfall for 2015-17. Once again, that figure was not an actual deficit. Indeed, even as a projected shortfall it was overstated. That’s because the standard for projections made in the months leading up to the next budget cycle is to include all the funding requests made by state agencies -- even though, in reality, those requests always get trimmed. That serves to temporarily inflate the actual picture. In the end, the 2015-17 budget approved by the Legislature and signed by Walker in July 2015 was balanced -- just as every other Wisconsin state budget is. Our ruling Mixing apples and oranges, Trump said that under Walker, "You were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state. You lost 2.2 (billion). You have right now a huge budget deficit. That’s not a Democratic point. That's a point. That’s a fact." There was in early 2014 a projection of a $1 billion surplus heading into the 2015-17 budget period. Late in 2014, there was a projection of a $2.2 billion shortfall -- the difference between expected revenues and the amount of money being requested by state agencies. But the shortfall was never a deficit -- and some of the surplus was consciously spent by Republicans, as tax cuts. Trump’s statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12700	"If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are. … Sometimes we ask them to do stuff that they're not capable of doing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/12/mick-mulvaney/fact-checking-white-house-attack-nonpartisan-cbos-/	As the Congressional Budget Office prepares its assessment of the Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the White House is already casting doubt on the agency’s credibility. During a segment on ABC’s This Week, White House Office of Management and Budget director Mick Mulvaney pointed to the CBO’s track record on the ACA as evidence that the agency isn’t capable of assessing a large piece of legislation. "If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are," Mulvaney said March 12. "So, I love the folks at the CBO, they work really hard. They do. Sometimes we ask them to do stuff that they're not capable of doing." This talking point has been popping up a lot in the last week. Gary Cohn, the director of the White House National Economic Council, painted a less-than-rosy picture of the CBO’s track record on Fox News Sunday on March 12. In addition, at a March 8 press conference, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, said "If you’re looking at the CBO for accuracy, you’re looking in the wrong place." Mulvaney has a point that the CBO’s projections for how many people would gain coverage through the ACA was higher than reality, but that criticism isn’t enough to undermine its ability to analyze the Republican repeal-and-replace bill. CBO predictions versus reality The CBO — the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress — released enrollment projections for the health care law in March 2010. It estimated that 21 million people would purchase coverage through the new insurance exchanges by 2016. At the end of 2016, more than 11.5 million individuals actually signed up for 2017 coverage, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That’s a difference of 9.5 million enrollees, even more than the figure Mulvaney provided. It's also possible Mulvaney was referring to CBO's March 2010 estimate of the reduction in the number of uninsured people. The CBO predicted 30 million fewer people would be uninsured in 2016 because of the ACA. However, in March 2016, the CBO reduced its estimate of the same quantity to 22 million. That's a difference of 8 million people on the mark. Still, experts said CBO’s forecasts were reasonable at the time. "With respect to precise quantitative point estimates, the differences between CBO's estimates and actual experience are well within the range that I would expect given the scope of the change CBO was being asked to analyze," said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program. Fiedler also noted that CBO's "big picture" assessment of the impact of the ACA on insurance coverage was on point. Specifically, the agency estimated a significant decrease in the number of people without health insurance that would leave the uninsured rate at a historic low, which is what occurred, he said. In addition, the figure ignores the fact that the 2010 prediction couldn’t account the Supreme Court decision about Medicaid expansion that allowed each state to decide for itself. Nineteen states have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility. According to a 2015 report from the Commonwealth Fund, the CBO overestimated enrollee total, but still offered projections closer to reality than four other forecasters (the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the RAND Corporation, the Urban Institute; and the Lewin Group). Importantly, the CBO reduced its projection of how many people would get health insurance this year through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces, from 21 million to 13 million. Initially, CBO analysts believed exchange enrollment would be higher in part because employers would drop insurance plans in favor of the marketplaces. That has not occurred. ‘They’re not capable’ Just because the CBO overestimated one measure of the Affordable Care Act in the past is not a reason enough to believe that they will miss in the same direction in the future, Fielder said. In fact, the CBO continuously adjusts their projections to incorporate new data, research, and experience, so if anything they shouldn’t repeat the same mistakes. With respect to the House bill, the CBO has the advantage of having just seen how implementing the ACA impacted insurance coverage. "That experience will be particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of rolling back provisions of the ACA, meaning that, if anything, one should probably expect estimates of this legislation to be more accurate than CBO's estimates of the effects of enacting the ACA," Fielder said. No prediction will ever be perfect, but for the most part, experts who have studied the CBO have found their projections to be largely sound. For example, the National Tax Journal in 1988 concluded that short-run projections from the CBO do not contain bias. A 2000 report comparing the forecasting of the CBO and the Federal Reserve Board concluded that, "The most accurate forecasting is done by the CBO, with the Fed a close second." Even the CBO released its own report in November 2015 that looked at how accurate their predictions have been, as well as what factors have contributed to forecasting errors. On average, between 1982 and 2014, the CBO overestimated two-year revenue forecasts by 1.1 percent and six-year projections by about 5.3 percent. Our ruling Mulvaney said, "If the CBO was right about Obamacare to begin with, there'd be 8 million more people on Obamacare today than there actually are." Mulvaney went on to say that the CBO may not be capable of assessing the GOP’s replacement plan. The initial CBO analysis of the Affordable Care Act did forecast that more people would participate in health care exchanges than actually did, but the CBO has revised those estimates. Moreover, independent analyses, as well as experts agree that the CBO offers some of the best estimates given the information available at the time. Mulvaney’s statement is partially accurate, but misses context that would give readers a different picture of the CBO. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08664	"We will be the first party to elect a bald guy to governor."	false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/13/john-thrasher/would-rick-scott-be-floridas-first-bald-governor/	2010 is a historic election year in Florida. A gripping three-way U.S. Senate race that could decide the balance of power in Washington. Competitive races for the state Cabinet. A proposed constitutional amendment that could shape state growth for decades. Then there's the governor's race, where the Nov. 2 election will produce either Florida's first female chief executive or, a leading Republican says, its first bald one. (Cue screeching of brakes.) You read that right — bald. Republican Party of Florida Chairman John Thrasher made that claim about Rick Scott on Sept. 10 at a victory party in Scott's honor. "Rick, we will be the first party to elect a bald guy to governor," was the exact quote, according to the Associated Press' Brendan Farrington. Editors note: Being serious fact-checkers, PolitiFact Florida immediately abandoned analyses about the future of Social Security, the extension of the Bush tax cuts and federal hurricane policy. The staff thought it that critical to see if Scott can make hair history. Because hair, after all, is a nonpartisan political issue. The Economist, in a recent piece, raced hair in politics back to the Roman Republic, telling the story of how enemies of an up-and-coming young general Publius Cornelius Scipio tried to derail his rise by implying that he grew his hair un-Romanly long, in a Greek style that seemed soft and suspicious. Then there's the modern-day stories of John Edwards' $400 haircuts during the 2008 presidential campaign and Marco Rubio having to explain that his $135 barbershop bill in Miami wasn't for a back wax. Scott, himself, already has poked fun at his (lack of) hair. "Remember me, the handsome bald guy?" Scott said during his primary night victory speech. Let the record show, Scott does have speckled gray and white hair around the sides and back of his head, but he is bald on the top and describes himself as bald. The official definition, let the record also show, is "lacking a natural or usual covering," according to Merriam-Webster. Knowing all that, we turned to Museum of Florida History Senior Curator Lisa Barton to help our exclusive investigation. Barton, among other things, curates the exhibit of the official portraits of Florida's governors on display at Florida's Historic Capitol building in Tallahassee. She dutifully scoured the portraits, which you can see for yourself online. "Check out the portrait of the 15th governor, Harrison Reed," she said. "It looks like he was bald on top." Reed served as the state's governor from 1868-1873. He's the 15th person to hold the title of governor, and the ninth after statehood. He was a Republican who faced two serious impeachment attempts from members of his own party, according to his biography. After leaving office, Reed became editor of the Semi-Tropical, a monthly magazine devoted to southern agricultural and economic development. He died in Jacksonville, where a street is named in his honor, in 1899. But none of that's really germane to this investigation. His head is. The bald top of his head. Just look at his official portrait. "Reed was a little man, slightly built, with a big, bald head and a bushy beard -- almost goat-like -- the upper lip shaven clean," wrote William Watson Davis in the book The Civil War and Reconstruction in Florida, Volume 53. "A full fringe of hair on three sides of the bald spot, a high forehead, and heavy spectacles gave him an owl-like appearance, which accentuated his calm moderation and well-poised personal address." Richard Nelson Current in Those Terrible Carpetbaggers had the same opinion, describing Reed as "bushy-bearded, bald-headed, (and) bespectacled." During our thorough investigation, we uncovered several governors with receding hairlines but we're hesitant to declare any other governor bald. William Dunn Moseley, the first elected governor of Florida post-statehood, was perhaps closest (he has no hair from his forehead to the crown of his head in his official portrait) — but far from a Shaquille O'Neal. Other contenders included George Franklin Drew (12th state governor, very high hairline), William Dunnington Bloxham (13th governor, widow's peak), and C. Farris Bryant (34th governor, balding. But bald?) To confirm the results of our investigation, we turned to Mike Mercado, a stylist for 11 years who has spent the past three working as an educator at the Aveda Institute in St. Petersburg. We showed him pictures of Scott, as well as the previous governors. He reached a stunning conclusion: He doesn't think Scott is bald at all. "He definitely looks bald because he clips the hair on his side so short," Mercado said. But Scott calls himself bald, we said. Bald on top might be a more accurate description, Mercado said. And for the others? He singled out Reed and Moseley. If they clipped their remaining hair as short as Scott, they would look "just as bald," Mercado said. So Thrasher said Scott would be a trailblazer for bald Floridians, being the first bald person elected governor. Thrasher — sorry, bad-pun police — is a hair off. First, there is a debate if Scott is truly bald. And even putting that aside, Reed was "just as bald" as Scott way back in 1868, and is described by historians as bald. We rate Thrasher's statement False. Now back to digesting that report about the future of Social Security …	None	John Thrasher	None	None	None	2010-09-13T16:18:04	2010-09-10	['None']
pomt-04212	Says the state is required "pick up 70 percent of the cost" of K-12 education.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/nov/30/john-kitzhaber/does-state-pick-70-percent-k-12-tab/	A few weeks back, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber offered his thoughts on several subjects during an address to the Oregon School Boards Association -- everything from PERS and No Child Left Behind to third-grade reading levels and his upcoming budget. Before wrapping up his speech, he said he wanted to touch on one more item: The "disconnect" between "what is bargained for at the local level and the actual fiscal condition of the state." The state, he said, has 197 school districts but nearly 350 local bargaining units and contracts. "These one- to three-year contracts that are bargained at the local level in many cases are disconnected from the revenue that's available in the state's school fund -- yet the state is required to come in on the back end and pick up 70 percent of the cost." There’s a fair point to be made there -- the state picks up part of the tab for spending that it doesn't have any hand in negotiating. Yet, the assertion that the state picks up 70 percent of what school districts spend caught us off guard. We did a quick check of the math from 2009-10 (that’s the most recent year that we have data available from the federal government) and found that total spending by K-12 school districts and education service districts was about $5.5 billion. The total state contribution to K-12 education that year was $2.95 billion. With a little division, you find that the state really only covered 53.4 percent of the bill -- not the 70 percent Kitzhaber referenced. That’s a ways off, so we got in touch with Amy Wojcicki, the governor’s spokeswoman, to see what was up. The governor, she said in an e-mail, was referring to "funding for schools that comes through the State School Fund. This includes local revenues (primarily property taxes) and state funding. The state funding equals about two-thirds of the State School Fund." If you go back to the 2009-10 figures, you can tease apart three pots of money in the total $5.5 billion going to K-12 education. About $4.4 billion comes from Oregon -- $2.95 billion from the state and $1.5 billion from local property taxes and whatnot. Another $1 billion or so comes from the federal government in various forms. To get that 70 percent figure, the governor looked at just the money originating in Oregon: $2.95 billion is about 66 percent of $4.4 billion. (He then rounded up.) But looking at the numbers that way didn’t make much sense to us. Why pretend that $1 billion doesn’t exist? Ben Cannon, the governor’s education adviser, laid out their reasoning for us. Basically, he said, the federal funding doesn’t take into account any of the local bargaining -- so it makes sense to look at just the funding that’s coming in at the state or local level. Even that explanation felt a little thin to us, though, because here’s the thing: The state and local funding levels aren’t connected to local bargaining either. Let’s say, for instance, that Portland Public Schools suddenly decided all teachers should receive $1 million a year in pay and benefits. Well, that doesn’t mean the state has to adjust funding to meet that additional cost or, for that matter, that property taxes would go up. Portland Public might put up a fight for it -- but ultimately the state can say "no." While that’s true, Cannon said, when school budgets grow, most of the pressure gets put on the state to step up. The reason for that, he said, is that the local taxes and the federal contributions are fairly fixed, so when the budgets are built, there’s essentially a gap between what schools need and what they’re getting through those first two sources. "The state's budget is built to fill that extra gap," Cannon said. "Do we have to fill it? No. But the expectation is the state will. The governor has said, on at least two occasions, "the state is required to come in on the back end and pick up 70 percent of the cost" of K-12 schools in Oregon. That’s really only the case if you don’t include federal funds in the entire K-12 budget. Moreover, the state isn’t "required" to fund to any level. Historically, the state has stepped up to fill that "gap," as Cannon describes it, but there’s no commitment that it must. This statement contains an element of truth but ignores some critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.	None	John Kitzhaber	None	None	None	2012-11-30T15:54:53	2012-11-10	['None']
pomt-15134	"Jesus was an undocumented immigrant."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/03/ryan-eller/jesus-was-undocumented-immigrant-ordained-minister/	An ordained minister on a CNN panel said people should choose their words carefully when discussing immigration, because even Jesus was "an undocumented immigrant." The Rev. Ryan Eller, executive director of Define American, a nonprofit promoting awareness of immigration issues, told Carol Costello that word choice about the issue matters. "Jesus was an undocumented immigrant himself when he fled to Egypt seeking persecution in his day," Eller said on Aug. 31, 2015. (Eller told PunditFact he meant "escaping persecution.") "And so the question becomes, would we call Jesus himself illegal if he were, you know, in our modern times?" Jesus’ immigration status obviously isn’t the most important part of his personal story. But people were curious if this piece of trivia holds up. In short, it doesn’t. The world in which Jesus lived was all a part of the Roman Empire, not necessarily a collection of separate sovereign nations. That makes it hard to call baby Jesus an illegal anything. What did Jesus do? Eller told PunditFact his comment was more about putting the plight of Jesus in the perspective of the modern world, not the bureaucratic details of his time. "Jesus was clearly an immigrant, and fled violence in his day," Eller said. "Many undocumented American immigrants have fled the most violent and desperate situations on the planet in search of survival and a better life." In the context of modern boundaries, border crossings between Israel and Egypt these days are contentious, but mostly because Israel aims to stop migrants and terrorists from coming into the country. Israel in 2013 erected a fence on the Egyptian border to reduce illegal migration. Egypt also has been working to prevent smugglers from moving people into Gaza. These days, it would indeed be difficult to move back and forth between the two countries easily without approval. But back to Jesus: The biblical account of what happened right after his birth is described in the gospel of Matthew, with some details provided in the gospel of Luke. Luke 2:1-5 says Joseph lived in Nazareth with Mary, who was pregnant with Jesus, when the Roman emperor called for all the residents of the empire to be counted and taxed. Joseph left for Bethlehem, where King David had been born, because Joseph had roots there. Anyone who celebrates Christmas is pretty aware what happened in Bethlehem, but Eller is referring to what happened after that. Matthew 2:12-16 describes how the Magi visited Jesus, then were warned by God in a dream not to tell King Herod, who wanted to kill the child. Joseph then took Mary and Jesus to Egypt. According to Matthew, Herod then had every male child in Bethlehem younger than 2 killed. Verses 17-23 say Joseph moved the family back to Nazareth after Herod died. That’s what the Bible says, but the historical context matters. To be clear, the Herodian Kingdom did largely correspond to what we now know as modern-day Israel. It was a client state subservient to the Roman Empire, ruled by Herod the Great, who had been appointed king by the Roman Senate. Egypt, or Aegyptus, was a Roman province and run by a prefect appointed by the emperor. There were many administrative vagaries among the vast territory Rome controlled at the time, but experts told us one thing was clear: Anyone who lived in the empire could pretty much go wherever they wanted. Well, as long as they paid their taxes. Clifford Ando, professor of classics, history and law at the University of Chicago, said historical accounts of the period offer an incomplete picture. But for the most part, we can say the empire did not restrict movement in a way comparable to requiring paperwork to cross provinces. There were customs stations in ports and on roads to tax goods, but nothing like a border patrol. "Rome did think of itself as keeping loose track of the borders of the empire, and of course it took a periodic census, and so did loosely record where people resided and owned property once a cycle," Ando said. "That's not the same thing as saying you couldn't move." By the second century C.E., subjects moving to a new province were required to register with the government, he said, but only if they planned to settle there. That likely was not what Joseph had in mind after being warned by God to flee to Egypt. Even though many scholars don’t agree on the exact years Jesus was born or moved to Nazareth as a youth, we know the family left Egypt after Herod the Great died in 4 B.C.E. The region known as Judaea (where Bethlehem was) became a Roman province in 6 C.E., after Rome removed Herod’s son Archelaus, who had become king of that portion of Herod’s kingdom. Nazareth, meanwhile, was in Galilee, an area later ruled by Herod’s son Antipas, known as the king who eventually beheaded John the Baptist. Charles Cochran, senior pastor at First Christian Church in Charleroi, Pa., said the Bible is full of scripture that illustrates the idea of accepting others as they are and helping those in need. But Eller’s description of Jesus and his family as comparable to undocumented immigrants was too much of a stretch, he said. "Joseph had to be cautious, but the caution had nothing to do with immigration status," Cochran said. "It was much more like sneaking across the Georgia-Alabama line than across the Rio Grande." Our ruling Eller said, "Jesus was an undocumented immigrant." He was making the point that Jesus and his family had to escape to a new land to avoid danger, as immigrant families sometimes do. In a historical context, however, Herod’s kingdom and the province of Egypt were ultimately governed by the Roman Empire, and weren’t separate nations as we know them now. Experts said there were likely very few, if any, restrictions on movement between the two, making the situation more akin to fleeing a state than another country. We rate Eller’s statement False.

pomt-04044	"One out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/29/dianne-feinstein/dianne-feinstein-says-one-five-law-enforcement-off/	Almost six weeks after the gun rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., took the lead in proposing a new assault weapons ban. She later argued for its passage on the Jan. 28, 2013, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. Host Bob Schieffer asked Feinstein, "What about the idea -- which some gun rights supporters cite -- they say, ‘Look, all of this is just to make people feel good. It's just, kind of, feel-good legislation’ -- that, in the end, it's not going to stop these kinds of incidents?" Feinstein responded in part, "Well, that's absolutely not true. What we are trying to do is overall see that weapons ... are in the hands of responsible citizens, that they are used legally, not illegally, that they do not fall into the hands of gangs. Do you realize we have 150,000-plus gang members in this nation? When they go up against the police, it's generally an AK-47. You realize that police have had to break into gun stores to get weapons that would be stronger than the adversary they had? Do you realize that one out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon?" A reader asked us whether it was true that "one out of every five law enforcement officers that's killed is killed with an assault weapon." So we looked into it. Because Feinstein was talking about gun policy, we will only look at the police officers killed by guns, which in any case accounted for 92 percent of law-enforcement deaths as a result of criminal action between 2002 and 2011, according to FBI data. When we checked with Feinstein’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a data from the Violence Policy Center, a "national educational organization working to stop gun death and injury" and a group that generally favors tighter gun regulations. This data, obtained from FBI records, showed that eight of the 45 gun-related killings of law-enforcement officers in 2009 were committed with assault weapons. That works out to be almost 18 percent -- quite close to the one in five Feinstein cited. And this wasn’t a fluke. Calculations published in 2003 by the center showed that during the years 1998 through 2001, at least 41 of the 211 law enforcement officers killed by guns were killed by assault weapons -- 19.4 percent. We should make an important point, however: There is significant disagreement over what is, or should be, considered "an assault weapon." Not all rifles are assault weapons, and not all assault weapons are rifles. For instance, in California -- Feinstein’s home state -- the law includes some types of handguns and shotguns in its definition of "assault weapon." But different state laws have different definitions. For the data it analyzed, the Violence Policy Center went beyond the basic statistics collected by the FBI, which is published in an annual report called "Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted." The FBI breaks the felonious killings of officers into those committed by handguns, rifles and shotguns (as well as by weapons other than guns). The FBI does not include a specific category for "assault weapons." For the two periods studied, the Violence Policy Center obtained additional information from the FBI about every incident in which an officer was killed, including the gun’s make and model. The Violence Policy Center has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for more recent data, but has not yet received the information yet, the Feinstein spokesman said. We showed the data to Mark E. Safarik, executive director of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit, to get an independent perspective on whether the Violence Policy Center’s classifications of weapons was reasonable. Safarik told PolitiFact that it’s reasonable to call at least seven of the weapons in the 2009 data "assault weapons." In the case of the eighth weapon -- a semiautomatic, .223 caliber rifle of unknown make and model -- he said it’s unclear whether it would qualify as an assault weapon. Dropping the number of assault weapons from eight to seven would make the percentage about 16 percent -- still not too far off from one in five. Still, Safarik and others urged caution, emphasizing that "assault weapon" can be molded to the purposes of whoever is using the term. "Whatever any politician wants to define as an assault weapon, that is the way it goes," said Vance McLaughlin, a criminal justice professor at Jacksonville State University in Alabama. "If I define an assault weapon as any semi-auto that has 11 or more cartridges in its magazine, I can then poach some numbers from the handgun category. And on and on and on." Our ruling Because the definition of "assault weapon" is subject to debate, the categorization of any given weapon is open to some interpretation. Still, while the numbers were analyzed by a group with a stake in the fight, we find the data reasonable. The data has been consistent in the five years studied, and at worst, Feinstein's figure for the most recent year, 2009, is only a few percentage points high. On balance, we rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Dianne Feinstein	None	None	None	2013-01-29T15:12:23	2013-01-27	['None']
pomt-14733	ISIS is "going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/19/hillary-clinton/fact-checking-hillary-clintons-claim-isis-using-vi/	During a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton took a shot at Republican primary frontrunner Donald Trump, saying that his rhetoric is a gift to ISIS. "We also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears," Clinton said during the debate. "He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists." Not having heard that before, our eyebrows went up when we heard Clinton’s comment, and we weren’t alone. The Twittersphere, on both the right and the left, picked up on Clinton’s statement and questioned whether she had any evidence for it. Extensive Google searches did not turn up any evidence. And the response from the Clinton campaign did not point to any specific videos. The campaign pointed to an NBC News article that quoted Rita Katz of the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors the social media activities of Islamic terrorist groups. "They love him from the sense that he is supporting their rhetoric," she said. "They follow everything Donald Trump says. When he says, 'No Muslims should be allowed in America,' they tell people, 'We told you America hates Muslims and here is proof.' " The article also quoted David Phillips, director of the Program on Peace-Building and Rights at Columbia University's Institute for the Study of Human Rights, saying that "Trump's incendiary anti-Muslim comments will surely be used by ISIS social media to demonize the United States and attract recruits to fight in Iraq and Syria." But while such quotes support the notion that ISIS could be making recruiting videos, or will do so, they do not support Clinton’s contention -- offered in the present tense -- that they are currently doing so. Vox.com tweeted at J.M. Berger, author of the book ISIS: The State of Terror, and Berger tweeted back, "I would be surprised if they had and we didn't hear about it in a big way." For now, it seems that Clinton has turned speculative left-of-center rhetoric into fact. Others have wondered if ISIS will use Trump’s statements against the United States. On Dec. 14, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, told Alisyn Camerota on CNN’s New Day that "Donald Trump could be a recruitment poster for ISIS because he is fanning the flames of hate." A few days earlier, Robert Kuttner of the American Prospect, a liberal magazine, wrote a column titled, "How ISIS and Trump Enable Each Other." In it, he wrote, "Trump’s collected speeches are like an ISIS recruiting video." At PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. We’ll update our fact-check in the event solid evidence emerges. But for now, that evidence does not exist. Our ruling Clinton said that ISIS is "going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists." We were unable to find any evidence to support this. The Clinton campaign did not provide any evidence that this is already happening -- only that it could be happening, or that it may in the future. If ISIS was using Trump for recruitment videos, we would expect a frenzy of media coverage over it. We rate this claim False. UPDATE, Jan. 5, 2016: About two weeks after Clinton’s comment, various news outlets reported that the terrorist group Al Shabaab had released a recruitment video that featured clips of Trump speaking shortly after the Dec. 2 terrorist shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., about his proposal for a temporary but "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S." As we noted in greater depth here, we aren’t changing our rating, because we rate statements based on evidence that was public at the time the statement was made. Before she made her comment, Clinton had no way of knowing about the Al Shabaab video. SITE Intelligence Group, which found the video, said it was distributed on Twitter on Dec. 31. In addition, Al Shabbab is not affiliated with ISIS.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-12-19T22:55:00	2015-12-19	['Islam', 'Donald_Trump']
pomt-08515	"Newspapers say Florida made bad investments, lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost. Who was in charge of Florida's investments? Alex Sink."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/06/republican-party-florida/republican-party-florida-says-alex-sink-was-charge/	Update: This item has been corrected to distinguish between the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund and the Local Government Investment Pool. Both were controlled by the State Board of Administration, but they are separate funds. You should believe our attack ad, because we found a lot of newspaper stories that support our case! Okay, so campaign attack ads don't really say that. But it seems to be the unstated premise of several ads featuring newspaper headlines and quotes from stories rushing across the screen. Take the latest attack ad from the Republican Party of Florida, which is campaigning against Democrat Alex Sink for governor. Her opponent is Republican Rick Scott, a former health care executive. Newspapers say Florida made bad investments, lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost. Who was in charge of Florida's investments? Alex Sink." Meanwhile, the screen flashes quotes and dates from the St. Petersburg Times: "the state of Florida made bad investments that lost hundreds of millions" and "Florida pension fund plummets." The ad then cuts to video of Sink: "I'm the fiscal watchdog for the citizens of our state, I have to look over how our citizens money is invested." The narrator goes on: "The press says our government skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments. Auditors blamed Sink for a 'weak controls and a lack of oversight.' And now she wants a promotion?" The screen flashes more quotes from the Times: "Florida's State Board of Administration skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments," and "weak internal controls and a lack of external oversight by trustees." Three of the four quotes are from a Times story published Sept. 19, 2010: Florida's State Board of Administration skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments. The other quote is from a story published Nov. 17, 2008, Florida pension fund plummets. The Republican Party of Florida has released other ads against Sink and the state pension fund; we rated a previous ad Barely True. We wanted to see if this latest attack was more accurate. We're going to examine its claim in two parts. "Newspapers say Florida made bad investments, lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost." The Florida Retirement System Trust Fund is a massive investment account, today worth about $117 billion and holding the retirement assets of about 1 million current and retired state employees. It is one of the largest retirement funds in the nation. When Wall Street melted down in 2008, the value of Florida's retirement fund fell, too. In Sept. 2007, the fund was at its peak at about $138.4 billion and by June 30, 2010, the value had declined to $109.34 billion, a $29 billion drop in value. Still, according to the last actuarial report completed in 2009, the fund is 88.5 percent funded -- meaning if every employee retired today, they would get 88.5 percent of their retirement benefits. A funding level of 80 percent is considered healthy. The State Board of Administration oversees the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund, as well as 33 additional public funds, including the Local Government Investment Pool. Hundreds of governments and organizations use this short-term fund like a money market fund and count on it for investments that are safe and easily converted to cash. The St. Petersburg Times story from Sept. 19, 2010, detailed the local fund's risky investments over the past few years. The investigation found that state officials aggressively sought exceptions to rules intended to stop the local fund from buying high-risk securities. From the story: "Going back at least seven years, state money managers had been trying to find a way around rules that restricted them from buying certain risky securities. Time and again they asked, time and again lawyers told them no. "But so eager were Florida's money managers for higher yields, they bought them anyway. In two months at the brink of the housing market meltdown in 2007, the state invested at least $9.5 billion in securities it was not authorized to buy, a review of confidential memos shows." The ad mixes state pension fund and the Local Government Investment Pool together. Where the SBA "skirted legal advice, gambled on risky investments," according to the St. Petersburg Times was not with the pension fund, but with the Local Government Investment Pool, which had chafed under rules that prevented it from buying higher risk (and possibly higher return) investments. The losses in the pension fund are assets that have declined in value. Some previous ads have confused this issue, implying that the money lost was cash that disappeared out of bank accounts. But this ad makes pretty clear that it's talking about declines in value in investments made from pension funds, which are commonly referred to as losses. We find the claim that Florida "lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost" to be mostly accurate. "Who was in charge of Florida's investments? Alex Sink." The ad then targets Sink in her role as chief financial officer, an elected position in Florida that oversees several functions, including overseeing the state's auditing and accounting functions. But the specific claims of lost pension money and bad investments is related to Sink's role as one of three members of the Board of Trustees on the State Board of Administration, or SBA, the board charged with overseeing both the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund and the Local Government Investment Pool. The other members of the board are Gov. Charlie Crist and Attorney General Bill McCollum. (Crist recently left the Republican Party to run as an independent for U.S. Senate against Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Kendrick Meek. McCollum lost to Scott in the Republican Party primary for governor.) According to statute, the three-member board "may retain investment advisers or managers, or both, external to in-house staff, to assist the board in carrying out the power specified," and the board "shall create an audit committee to assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities." So the board doesn't directly invest and administer the money but delegates the responsibility to an executive director. Ash Williams is the current executive director, and the job of investing the state's assets is divided between in-house investment managers and external investment managers. So as a member of the board, Sink is "in charge," but she's in charge along with the two other trustees. And she's not responsible for day-to-day investment decisions. Still, in April 2008, the board commissioned an audit that found many questionable purchases of securities, purchases that were riskier than what state rules should have allowed. The auditors said they were not hired to do a criminal investigation, and it was ''outside the scope" to determine if the problems were the result of fraud or illegal acts. But the audit found weak internal controls and a lack of external oversight by the trustees -- Crist, Sink and McCollum. It's a fair question to ask whether Sink, as a member of the board, asked enough questions and demanded enough answers. It is not accurate to imply, as the ad, does that she alone was in charge. The Times investigation repeatedly mentions that Sink, Crist and McCollum were the three charged with oversight of the funds and does not single out Sink for blame. Our ruling In the context of making investments, the ad rightly claims that Florida "lost hundreds of millions of dollars, billions in pension funds lost," as the St. Petersburg Times stories reported. But the ad is misleading with its implication that Alex Sink was in charge of the funds as chief financial officer. She was one of three members of an oversight panel during a historic decline in investment values, and there are other people who bear responsibility for what happened to Florida's pensions funds, including internal and external financial managers. Still, Sink was one of three members who were in charge of defending the state's interest. The newspaper stories that the ad mentions don't single out Sink as being "in charge." So we rate this statement Half True.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2010-10-06T14:16:18	2010-09-27	['Alex_Sink']
pomt-13322	As a result of Chris Sununu’s vote against a Planned Parenthood contract, "nearly 3,000 fewer" women and families statewide accessed health care for birth control, cancer screenings and annual exams.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/oct/06/colin-van-ostern/colin-van-ostern-says-rejection-planned-parenthood/	Over the past few years, the issue of Planned Parenthood funding has turned New Hampshire’s little-known Executive Council into a lightning rod for controversy. Now that two executive councilors - Republican Chris Sununu and Democrat Colin Van Ostern - are running for governor, their votes on Planned Parenthood have become a significant issue on the campaign trail. Van Ostern has repeatedly claimed Sununu’s 2015 vote against $639,000 of state funding to Planned Parenthood of Northern New England denied health care to thousands of women and families in the state, saying nearly 3,000 fewer women and families accessed services statewide because of the defeated contract. Van Ostern has repeatedly said the lost funding has affected "thousands" of women and families. "Real damage can come from one vote on the executive council," he said during an August speech. As a result of Sununu’s vote, "nearly 1,000 fewer women and families accessed health care here for birth control and cancer screenings and annual exams in this city of Manchester and nearly 3,000 fewer did statewide," he said. Van Osten went back to the point again at a Concord Monitor/NECN debate on Oct. 5, saying as a result of Sununu’s vote, "fewer women got birth control, cancer screening and annual exams." PolitiFact decided to take a look at the numbers. There’s little question Sununu was the swing vote on Planned Parenthood funding. He had voted for similar contracts in the past, and when the funding came up in August 2015, he cited concerns about videos that purportedly showed Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue. In June, 2016, he changed course, and the funding was ultimately restored by a 3-2 vote. To get a scope of the numbers of women that were affected, we reached out to Van Ostern’s camp, which cited a 2015 WMUR article that quoted Planned Parenthood of Northern New England Senior Policy Advisor Jennifer Frizzell. "According to details provided by Frizzell, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England served 14,191 patients at the end of 2014, but that number dropped by 21 percent, to 11,119, by the end of 2015 as a result of the ‘lost funding,’" the article said. But numbers from Planned Parenthood show something different. The five Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire saw 11,078 patients in 2014; the following year, they saw about 1,000 fewer patients statewide, according to numbers provided by the organization. It turns out that the 21 percent drop the WMUR article references included patients that were lost when a West Lebanon Planned Parenthood clinic relocated to neighboring White River Junction, Vt. in 2014. Before the relocation, Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire saw about 14,000 patients. That number dropped to about 11,000 after the West Lebanon clinic moved. The drop of 1,000 patients between 2014 and 2015 also takes into account a 5-week closure of the Claremont Planned Parenthood clinic after it was vandalized and heavily damaged. That clinic served 948 patients in 2014, which fell 20 percent to 755 the following year, the steepest drop out of all the clinics. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England spokeswoman Victoria Bonney said the lost funding from Sununu’s 2015 Executive Council vote affected access to services including family planning, birth control, well-woman visits, cancer screenings and STI testing and treatment, but patients were never turned away. Bonney said the lost funding did not result in staff layoffs or denying patients care. Rather, it impacted scheduling and meant fewer patients were seen each day. Some health centers normally staffed with three practitioners a day had to scale back to two, according to Bonney. "During the defund, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England never turned patients away and tried to meet demand with fewer resources," Bonney said. "But when patients hear Planned Parenthood has been defunded, they put off health care. With so much media attention on Chris Sununu’s 2015 vote to defund Planned Parenthood, patients may have been uncertain if they could still access necessary services." Our ruling Democratic candidate for governor Colin Van Ostern said as a result of Chris Sununu’s vote against a Planned Parenthood contract, "nearly 3,000 fewer" women and families statewide accessed health care for birth control, cancer screenings and annual exams Sununu, a Republican, did vote against a $639,000 Planned Parenthood contract in 2015. It led to fewer shifts at clinics, but no patients were ever turned away or denied care, the organization said. The numbers cited by Van Ostern weren’t accurate. About 1,000 fewer women accessed Planned Parenthood from one year to the next. His numbers, however, failed to account for one clinic moving out of state, and another one being closed for 5 weeks following an incident of vandalism. Still, some patients may have stayed away following the publicity surrounding the vote. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06699	A new college tuition reciprocity agreement with Minnesota "makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/04/scott-walker/wisconsin-governor-scott-walker-says-tuition-recip/	The start of September means the start of college classes in Wisconsin and Minnesota -- two states that for more than 45 years have used tuition reciprocity agreements to make it easier for students in each state to attend school across the border. Reciprocity means a Wisconsin resident who attends a public university or technical college in Minnesota is treated as a Minnesota resident and can pay in-state tuition, rather than the higher out-of-state tuition rate. The same goes for Minnesota residents attending college in Wisconsin. The difference is significant. At the University of Minnesota, for example, in-state tuition in 2011-2012 is $13,062 and out-of-state tuition is $5,000 more, figures from the Minnesota Office of Higher Education show. When the annual renewal of the reciprocity agreement was announced on Aug. 15, 2011, an article on JSOnline.com, the website of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, carried this headline: "Wisconsin students to pay more under new tuition pact with Minnesota." The additional cost would be about $1,400 more each year for Wisconsin residents attending the University of Minnesota and about $2,200 for those attending the University of Minnesota-Duluth, the article said. The amounts vary at other campuses. But in a news release issued the same day, Gov. Scott Walker said: "This new tuition reciprocity agreement with the State of Minnesota makes college education more affordable for Wisconsin residents. Smaller tuition bills widen access to higher education, and that’s a win-win situation for students and Wisconsin." Wait. More affordable even as you pay more? Sounds like the new math. Let’s hit the books. Since 1965, Wisconsin has had a tuition reciprocity agreement with Minnesota in one form or another, according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It’s the only reciprocity agreement that allows Wisconsin residents to attend public universities outside of Wisconsin and pay the lower in-state tuition rate. Other reciprocity agreements relate to community and technical colleges in Michigan, Illinois and Iowa, according to the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board. Because tuition in Minnesota is generally higher, the reciprocity agreement was amended in 2007 so that Wisconsin would make supplementary payments to Minnesota schools, according to the state fiscal bureau. Here’s an example of how the supplementary payment worked in the 2010-2011 school year: Two schools considered comparable under the reciprocity agreement are the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Minnesota, where nearly half of the Wisconsin reciprocity students studying in Minnesota attend school. In 2010-2011, tuition was $9,794 at the Twin Cities campus and $8,398 at UW-Madison, a difference of $1,396. A Wisconsin resident attending the University of Minnesota had to pay only the $8,398; that meant the University of Minnesota was receiving $1,396 less than it received from a Minnesota resident. Through the supplementary payment, the State of Wisconsin paid the difference of $1,396 to the University of Minnesota. Under the new reciprocity agreement, the supplementary payments to Minnesota schools are eliminated. That means Wisconsin residents, starting with freshmen entering college in 2012-2013, will have to pay the full in-state tuition to attend school in Minnesota. Had the supplements been eliminated in 2010-2011, a Wisconsin resident attending the University of Minnesota would have had to pay $1,396 more in tuition. The move is expected to save Wisconsin $2.6 million in 2012-2013 and more in subsequent years, according to the fiscal bureau. In announcing the new reciprocity agreement, Walker said more than 10,000 Wisconsin students participate in the program every year. But his news release didn’t explain his quote about how the new deal makes college more affordable for Wisconsin residents, so we asked his spokesman, Cullen Werwie, for evidence. Werwie didn’t have any. He simply pointed out that, if there were no reciprocity agreement, Wisconsin residents would have to pay the higher out-of-state tuition rate to attend school in Minnesota. But that goes without saying. What’s more, the idea of tuition reciprocity is not new. An agreement has been in place since before Walker was born. Let’s go to the Truth-O-Meter. Walker said the new tuition reciprocity agreement between Wisconsin and Minnesota makes college "more affordable for Wisconsin residents." But the new agreement doesn’t make attending school in Minnesota any more affordable. In fact, it’s just the opposite. By eliminating supplementary payments from the state, the typical reciprocity student from Wisconsin will have to pay $1,400 more in tuition each year, based on 2010-2011 figures. Walker’s statement grades out as Pants on Fire.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-09-04T09:00:00	2011-08-15	['Minnesota', 'Wisconsin']
pomt-12433	"The minute the president speaks about it to someone, he has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/16/james-risch/does-president-have-ability-declassify-anything-an/	The blockbuster article in the Washington Post saying President Donald Trump had "revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting" didn’t just put the White House on the defensive. It also put Republican lawmakers in a tight spot. One of the members of Congress who commented after the newspaper’s revelations was Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho. According to CNN, he told reporters, "The minute the president speaks about it to someone, he has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process." Is that accurate? Independent experts said Risch is on target concerning the legal powers of the president. Some experts added, however, that the senator’s formulation left out some context that is relevant for assessing Trump’s alleged actions. The president’s classification and declassification powers are broad Experts agreed that the president, as commander-in-chief, is ultimately responsible for classification and declassification. When someone lower in the chain of command handles classification and declassification duties -- which is usually how it’s done -- it’s because they have been delegated to do so by the president directly, or by an appointee chosen by the president. The majority ruling in the 1988 Supreme Court case Department of Navy vs. Egan -- which addressed the legal recourse of a Navy employee who had been denied a security clearance -- addresses this line of authority. "The President, after all, is the ‘Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States’" according to Article II of the Constitution, the court’s majority wrote. "His authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security ... flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the President, and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant." Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, said that such authority gives the president the authority to "classify and declassify at will." In fact, Robert F. Turner, associate director of the University of Virginia's Center for National Security Law, said that "if Congress were to enact a statute seeking to limit the president’s authority to classify or declassify national security information, or to prohibit him from sharing certain kinds of information with Russia, it would raise serious separation of powers constitutional issues." The official documents governing classification and declassification stem from executive orders. But even these executive orders aren’t necessarily binding on the president. The president is not "obliged to follow any procedures other than those that he himself has prescribed," Aftergood said. "And he can change those." Indeed, the controlling executive order has been rewritten by multiple presidents. The current version of the order was issued by President Barack Obama in 2009. The national-security experts at the blog Lawfare wrote in the wake of the Post’s revelation that the "infamous comment" by President Richard Nixon -- that "when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal" -- "is actually true about some things. Classified information is one of them. The nature of the system is that the president gets to disclose what he wants." Two caveats So Risch’s comment holds water when it comes to the extent of the president’s powers. But some experts said that Risch’s formulation leaves out some notable aspects of the particular case involving Trump. The first caveat: While Trump has the power to declassify information, he doesn’t appear to have done that in this case, at least at the time the story broke. "There’s no question that the president has broad authority to declassify almost anything at any time without any process, but that’s not what happened here," said Stephen I. Vladeck, professor at the University of Texas School of Law. "He did not, in fact, declassify the information he shared with the Russians, which is why the Washington Post did not publish that information." Instead, Vladeck said, Trump "took it upon himself to authorize officials from a foreign government to receive classified national security information that was itself derived from a different foreign government’s intelligence gathering. That’s just not the same thing as what Sen. Risch described, and the law on this topic is far murkier." Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at NYU’s Brennan Center, agreed that Risch’s point speaks to general presidential authority but not what happened in this particular case. "Trump surely would not concede that the information in question is now ‘unclassified’ and available to anyone who files a FOIA request," she said. "The relevant question, therefore, is not whether the president can spontaneously declassify information, but whether the president is permitted to disclose sensitive national security information to anyone he wishes." Turner noted, however, that this isn’t necessarily a big distinction, since the president is ultimately the decider of what is classified and not. If his appointees disagree with his actions, "he can overrule their decisions," Turner said. "Within the Executive Branch the president is the boss." The second caveat: Just because something is legal doesn’t mean that it’s a smart idea. "The important caveat is that ‘legal’ and ‘sensible’ may be different things," said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org. "It may be legal, but it may fail to avoid the appearance of impropriety." Setting aside ethics, doing what Trump is alleged to have done could have negative practical consequences for the United States. "It could wreck the underlying intelligence-sharing agreement and place the U.S. at a disadvantage," Aftergood said. That said, the line between wise and unwise is a judgment call. On the one hand, Turner agreed that alienating an ally by not following their orders "could have very serious consequences." On the other hand, he said, it’s not outlandish to argue that sharing closely held information with Russia could advance, rather than hurt, national interests. Turner said it may be "in America’s interest to cooperate with Russia in the struggle against ISIS, including sharing intelligence information that may help save Russian lives and seeking information that may save American lives and those of other potential victims of ISIS attacks. Obviously, in the process we will want to safeguard sources and methods that might weaken our ability to keep track of what President Putin is up to--as he is potentially a greater threat to our security than is ISIS. But the struggle against ISIS is an area where the United States and Russia have a shared interest." In a statement to PolitiFact, Risch’s office said that criticism of the wisdom of President Trump's action would be a personal opinion, but such sentiments would not speak to "the letter of the law." "Sen. Risch can tell you that all former presidents of the United States spoke regularly with heads of states and discussed classified matter, if they determined it to be in the best interest of the American people," the statement said. Our ruling Risch said, "The minute the president speaks about it to someone, he has the ability to declassify anything at any time without any process." We found broad agreement that a president, using powers granted by the Constitution, is able to declassify essentially anything. However, experts added that Risch’s comment was not entirely on point for the particular situation involving Trump. In this case, it appears Trump didn’t actually use his declassification power before talking to the Russian officials, and just because Trump’s actions were legal doesn’t necessarily mean they were wise. These caveats add nuance to analyses of what Trump did. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-10438	"More people without health care since George Bush took office; more children in poverty since George Bush took office."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/08/barack-obama/more-uninsured-but-blame-skewed/	In a recent speech, Sen. Barack Obama took a swipe at presumptive Republican nominee Sen. John McCain, chastising McCain's characterization of economic gains during President George W. Bush's tenure. Obama talked about things that have gone amiss in the past 7 years, beginning with the rising population of uninsured Americans. "More people without health care since George Bush took office; more children in poverty since George Bush took office," Obama said during an April 18, 2008, speech in Williamsport, Pa. Obama is promoting a health plan that he contends will offer universal coverage and address the needs of individuals who do not currently have health insurance. We've already ruled that Obama's plan does not guarantee universal coverage. Obama is correct that the uninsured population has grown during this decade. An analysis of Census data by representatives of the Commonwealth Fund, a health care think tank, finds the uninsured population has risen by 8.6-million people since 2000, reaching a total 47-million in 2006, the last year for which figures are available. The primary culprit is the rapid growth in health care costs and premiums, which is leading employers — especially small companies — to pass more costs to workers or eliminate coverage altogether. Candidates have largely focused on three strategies to address the problem: offer tax incentives to buy private insurance policies (McCain's favored option), insure everyone through a government-run program like Medicare or create a hybrid group insurance market that would provide people with a choice of public or private health plans (the preferred route of Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton, though we've examined the differences between their plans ). Obama's statement highlights a major social policy concern, but it's not entirely accurate to pin all the blame on President Bush. Health costs are driven in large part by increased use of sophisticated medical tests and procedures, as well as rising drug costs and falling personal incomes. The second half of Obama's statement, "more children in poverty since George Bush took office," can be interpreted in different ways. We take him to mean that more children are below the poverty level now than in 2000. Census statistics support that point, showing the population of families below the poverty level with children under the age of 18 increased from 4.9-million in 2000 to 5.8-million in 2006. Obama correctly cites the growing number of uninsured Americans, as well as children in poverty, since President Bush took office. But by making Bush's tenure the benchmark for measuring those statistics, Obama is implying a level of direct responsibility for the numbers that can't quite be established with complicated social matters. That brings us to Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-05-08T00:00:00	2008-04-18	['George_W._Bush']
pomt-04872	"One of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns. Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/09/upendra-chivukula/upendra-chivukula-claims-leonard-lance-was-not-gun/	U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance was elected to Congress, then took a hard right turn on his position on gun control, according to Upendra Chivukula, a Democratic state Assemblyman who hopes to unseat Lance in November. "One of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns," Chivukula said in an Aug. 5 interview with the liberal blog Blue Jersey. "Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks, which is mostly dangerous for the people who are visiting the national park." Lance, a former state senator, has faced criticism for shedding more moderate views since he was sworn in to the House of Representatives in 2009. So here, PolitiFact New Jersey wondered if Lance (R-7th Dist.) was "not for guns" in 2008 but then said, "you can carry concealed weapons in national parks." The congressman’s position on the latter half of that claim is clear: he supports it. In May 2009, Lance voted to repeal the ban on visitors possessing firearms on federal public land, as long as gun owners comply with the laws of the state where the park is located. Lance touts that vote on his campaign website in a section on Second Amendment rights. But was Lance "not for guns" just a year prior to that vote, in 2008? That’s a broad, unsupported claim that suggests Lance opposed firearms and then reversed his position. We found no evidence that Lance advocated against guns. Joey Novick, Chivukula’s campaign manager, pointed us to a survey from Project Vote Smart, a nonpartisan group that tracks where candidates stand on key issues, to support Chivukula’s claim. In 2007 -- as Lance was vying for another term in the New Jersey Senate -- he filled out the survey, which asks candidates to note which positions they would support in a number of areas if elected. In a section labeled "gun issues," Lance indicated he would "maintain and strengthen the enforcement of existing state restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns." He also noted his support to "require a license for gun possession." But that doesn’t prove Lance was "not for guns," only that he supported enforcing New Jersey’s current laws. Todd Mitchell, Lance’s chief of staff, said that Lance has always been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, pointing to a number of "pro-gun" votes during his time as a state legislator. Also, Mitchell noted that in 2007 the state chapter of the NRA endorsed Lance’s re-election bid. "This is a feeble attempt by the Chivukula campaign to distract voters from Upendra's dismal fiscal record as a member of the Democratic leadership in Trenton," Mitchell said. Novick said Chivukula’s overall point was that in "many issues––including guns and Second Amendment issues, Leonard Lance has moved to extreme positions that are more right wing." Our ruling Chivukula said "one of the key things about Leonard Lance is that in 2008, when you look at [the] Project Vote Smart website, he was not for guns. Now he has gone too far to the right, saying that you can carry concealed weapons in national parks." There’s an element of truth to this claim: Lance voted to repeal a ban on carrying weapons in national parks in 2009, as long as the gun owner complies with the laws of the state where the park is located. But to suggest Lance flip-flopped in taking that position is misleading. The survey Chivukula’s campaign cited shows Lance, as a state legislator, favored enforcing New Jersey’s current laws. To say Lance was "not for guns" is wrong. We rate this statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Upendra Chivukula	None	None	None	2012-08-09T07:30:00	2012-08-05	['None']
pomt-02008	"Last year," Obama "administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions. The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping and thousands of drug-related crimes."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/10/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-claim-about-obamas-prison-break-illega/	U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, recently charged President Barack Obama with freeing thousands of convicted murderers, kidnappers, rapists and other criminals before deportation. Obama's "lax immigration policies continue to put the lives of Americans at risk," Smith said in his letter in the May 31, 2014, San Antonio Express-News. "Last year, administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions," Smith wrote. "The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping, and thousands of drug-related crimes. This would be considered the worst prison break in American history, except it was approved by the president and enabled by immigration officials." Did Obama deliver the equivalent of a giant prison break? By email, Smith spokeswoman Kim Smith Hicks told us Rep. Smith relied on a May 2014 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that focuses on lessening immigration. The report said that from October 2012 through September 2013, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement "freed 36,007 convicted criminal aliens from detention who were awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings," according to an ICE document obtained by the center. By phone, the report’s author, Jessica Vaughan, told us the document came to the center from someone she declined to identify who fielded it in connection with congressional inquiries to the agency. The center included a chart in its report showing more than 88,000 convictions including 116 homicide convictions and more than 300 sexual assault offenses. But the biggest cluster of convictions (17,000-plus) were for traffic offenses, followed by more than 15,000 drunk-driving violations. The released individuals accumulated about 9,200 "dangerous drugs" convictions, according to the chart, and 5,000 larceny offenses. The document didn’t itemize reasons for the releases. But the center’s report said individuals were subsequently subject to little to no government supervision, though an unknown number were required to check in by telephone or to wear tracking devices. The center said less than 3,000 were released due to a 2001 Supreme Court decision preventing ICE from indefinitely detaining certain individuals whose countries will not take them back. Vaughan told us all the convicts were let go from ICE-run facilities or other jails where housing had been federally paid for. Separately, a May 16, 2014, Associated Press news story pointed out the released individuals had all completed their criminal jail sentences, according to ICE. Also, the story said, nearly all the released individuals still faced deportation along with required check-ins with authorities while their cases were pending. And why were the detainees let go? The story quoted an ICE spokeswoman, Barbara Gonzalez, as saying that in many of the tallied cases, the agency was required by law to release the immigrants while their deportation cases were pending. "The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report," Gonzalez said. For example, she said, mandatory releases accounted for over 72 percent of the immigrants convicted of homicide, the AP reported. We reached out to Gonzalez, hearing back from Carl Rusnok, a Dallas-based ICE spokesman, who emailed us similar information. "Convicted criminals come into the agency’s custody to undergo removal proceedings after they have already satisfied the terms of their criminal sentence," Rusnok said. "In many of the releases in 2013, ICE was required by law to release the individuals from custody, pursuant to decisions by the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Once in ICE custody, many of the individuals described in the report were released under restrictions such as GPS monitoring, telephone monitoring, supervision, or bond." Rusnok continued: "The releases required by court decisions account for a disproportionate number of the serious crimes listed in the report. For example, mandatory releases account for over 72% of the homicides listed." He added: "Others, typically those with less serious offenses, were released as a discretionary matter after career law enforcement officers made a judgment regarding the priority of holding the individual, given ICE’s resources, and prioritizing the detention and removal of individuals who pose a risk to public safety or national security." The Obama administration has asked Congress to fund fewer so-called detention beds in ICE facilities than before, we noted in a June 2013 fact check. An April 12, 2013, Washington Times news article summed up: "Congress fought hard during the past decade to boost the number of detentions, arguing that those who were allowed back into the general population rarely returned to be deported." That story quoted then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as saying the department believed it could keep all high-priority individuals detained with the lower number of beds, while making use of alternatives to track the other people in deportation proceedings. By email, the center’s Vaughan ultimately called Smith’s recent statement "completely factual and correct." Earlier, Vaughan told us she saw little import to the released individuals reportedly fulfilling prison sentences due to their criminal convictions before their immigration cases were taken up. No information has been released, she said, about how many of the individuals were released under personal recognizance or on bonds, both of which she described as tantamount to no post-release supervision. Reminded of ICE saying 72 percent of the individuals convicted of murder were let go under a court’s direction, Vaughan said that means 28 percent were released at the government’s discretion. Released individuals might still face deportation, Vaughan said, but she’s doubtful many will show up for final decisions. She said the center has separately calculated that some three in four ICE detainees released while their immigration cases are pending fail to show up to finish the cases. Our ruling Smith wrote: "Last year, administration officials released into our neighborhoods more than 36,000 criminal immigrants who had nearly 88,000 convictions. The crimes included hundreds of convictions for murder, rape and kidnapping, and thousands of drug-related crime This statement has accurate figures, but fails to acknowledge that an unknown number of the releases--including nearly three in four of the individuals convicted of murder--were not at the administration’s discretion. Also missing: Most of the tallied convictions weren’t for violent offenses; each released individual didn’t skip out on prison time connected to criminal convictions; and most released individuals still faced deportation.

pomt-11594	Says one year later, "the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and Syria."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/trump-isis-territory-losses-near-100/	President Donald Trump spoke proudly of gains made in the fight against the Islamic State. He looked back to his pledge in 2017 to "extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth." "One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and Syria," Trump said. According to data from IHS Markit, a private defense and security research firm, the area controlled by the Islamic State went from 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015 to 6,759 square kilometers in January 2018. That’s a 93 percent reduction in territory, which is pretty close to 100 percent. But Trump’s emphasis on the one-year time frame and territory "just recently held" by the Islamic State pushes his claim a bit. If that means since he took office, then the Islamic State’s losses are closer to 89 percent. The success Trump described built upon strategy and attacks launched under President Barack Obama. The campaign to defeat ISIS took shape in September 2014 under the name of Operation Inherent Resolve. According to U.S. Air Force Central Command data, coalition forces engaged the enemy over 33,000 times between the launch of the operation and November 2017. (The Air Force includes strikes taking place in August 2014.) Counting only sorties in which at least one weapon was released, about three fourths of the action took place during the Obama years. The Air Force reports over 104,000 missiles, bombs and other explosives dropped in the course of the campaign. About two-thirds of that came before Trump took office. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact in January that Trump devolved more authority to the tactical level on the battlefield, which sped up U.S. operations and produced "a real shift … that contributed to ISIS's precipitous collapse in mid 2017." Our ruling Trump said that after one year, coalition forces had freed almost 100 percent of the territory just recently held by the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. According to data from a private defense and security group, the Islamic State controls 93 percent less terrority today than it did at the start of 2015, and 89 percent less since Trump took office. The fight against the Islamic State began two years before Trump became commander in chief, and the radical militant group saw significant territorial losses by the end of 2016. His words link the most recent gains too closely to actions taken during his time in office. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-09241	"Ms. Kagan has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway."	true	/texas/statements/2010/may/10/john-cornyn/republicans-say-supreme-court-nominee-elena-kagan-/	Shortly after President Barack Obama nominated Solicitor General Elena Kagan to replace Justice John Paul Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court, a number of Republicans lined up to raise questions about her qualifications. Among the most common themes from Republicans was that Kagan has the resume of a legal elitist, tied primarily to academia and inside-the-Capital-Beltway jobs. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, the junior senator from Texas, urged the Senate to thoroughly review Kagan's record — and aired his trepidations about it. "There is no doubt that Ms. Kagan possesses a first-rate intellect, but she is a surprising choice from a president who has emphasized the importance of understanding 'how the world works and how ordinary people live,' " Cornyn said in a May 10, 2010, press release. "Ms. Kagan has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway. These are not places where one learns 'how ordinary people live.' " For the record, Harvard Square refers to Kagan's work at Harvard Law School and Hyde Park is the neighborhood occupied by the University of Chicago, where Kagan once taught. We should note that Obama himself attended law school at Harvard, and his private home is in Chicago's Hyde Park. And his current employment is about as inside the D.C. Beltway as one can get. Putting aside the political argument that working in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway is not a good way to learn how ordinary people live, we decided to check Kagan's resume to find out if Cornyn is correct that the entirety of Kagan's career was spent in these three places. A judiciary committee questionnaire Kagan filled out after Obama nominated her for the solicitor general position in 2009 provides an accounting of her professional career. Working our way back from the present, here's Kagan's employment history (and, in parentheses, where they fit into Cornyn's definition): March 2009-present: U.S. solicitor general (D.C. Beltway) 1999 -2009: professor and dean, Harvard Law School; 2003-2009 as dean; 2001-2009 as professor focusing on constitutional and administrative law; and 1999-2001 as visiting professor (Harvard Square) 1997-1999: deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton for domestic policy (D.C. Beltway) 1995-1996: associate counsel to President Clinton (D.C. Beltway) 1991-1994: assistant professor at University of Chicago Law School, primarily teaching constitutional law (Hyde Park) Summer 1993: special counsel, Senate Judiciary Committee, working on the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court (D.C. Beltway) 1989-1991: associate at Williams & Connolly in Washington, D.C., doing mix of commercial, First Amendment and white-collar criminal law (D.C. Beltway) 1988: staff member, Dukakis for President campaign, Boston, mostly preparing responses to attacks on Gov. Dukakis' record. 1987-1988: judicial clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall (D.C. Beltway) 1986-1987: judicial clerk for Judge Abner Mikva, U.S. Court of Appeals for D.C. (D.C. Beltway) Summer 1986: research assistant for Professor Laurence Tribe at Harvard Law School (Harvard Square) Summer 1985: summer associate for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York City Summer 1984: summer associate at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson in New York City Summer 1983: paralegal at Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy in New York City Some may quibble that when Kagan worked as a staff member on the Dukakis campaign in 1988, the campaign headquarters was in Boston, not nearby Harvard Square (though one could argue that working on a presidential campaign is by definition D.C. Beltway-related) or that she worked for three summers during graduate school at New York City law firms. And White House officials argue Kagan's roots as the granddaughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants, the daughter of a public school teacher and a tenant lawyer, and her career as an accomplished lawyer and well-regarded teacher solidify her "ordinary people" cred. Asked about this issue, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs cited Kagan's "diversity of experience" and noted that as solicitor general, Kagan "represents the American people before the Supreme Court." But it's fair to say that Kagan has spent the bulk of her professional career in academia at the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School, and at various positions inside the Beltway. Again, whether that puts Kagan out of touch with "how ordinary people live," is a political discussion. But Cornyn's claim that Kagan "has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park and the D.C. Beltway" is True.

pomt-13547	On job creation numbers in the latest Start-Up NY report: "This is a significant number of overcounts in the compilation that I’ve looked at."	false	/new-york/statements/2016/aug/26/robin-schimminger/explaining-startup-ny-report/	Assemblyman Robin Schimminger, D-Kenmore, said state officials reported an incorrect number of jobs created by companies participating in Start-Up NY, one of the state’s economic development programs. A report released in July says the program created 408 jobs in its first two years, 2014 and 2015. Schimminger, who chairs the Assembly’s Economic Development Committee, said at a hearing earlier this month that Empire State Development Corp. inflated its claim of 319 jobs in 2015 by as many as 80 positions. The report puzzled Schimminger and other lawmakers because it showed more net new jobs for the companies than the number of jobs the companies said they created. "I could not figure out how that could be, until I came to the conclusion that very possibly the companies were reporting a two-year amount, the 2014 and 2015 net new jobs created and including them in their submission to the agency," Schimminger said at the hearing. "The agency then simply took that number, tallied it and reached what should be the correct tally number to include in the report. However, they were the wrong numbers from the companies. So I would submit this is not the difference of a dozen or so, this is a significant number of overcounts in the compilation that I’ve looked at." Howard Zemsky, head of the Empire State Development Corp., defended Start-Up NY before the Assembly panel. "I don’t acknowledge that there are any inaccurate numbers," Zemsky replied. Who’s right? We took a closer look. Did the Start-Up NY report inflate job claims by double counting many of the jobs? What’s a net new job? Start-Up NY offers businesses tax relief for 10 years when they locate or expand on or near a participating college campus. The state must publish an annual report on the program’s progress. This year’s report was tucked inside an omnibus report of other state incentive programs called the Business Incentives Report. The section on Start-Up NY takes less than three pages. Last year’s report was a 14-page document. This year’s report offers little guidance on how to interpret the information in the report other than a few footnotes and a set of unidentified appendices. Understanding the report requires knowing the state’s definition of a ‘net new job.’ It’s not just any job created during the year. It must be a job that did not exist before the company joined the program. It has to be full time. It has to be filled for more than six months. Empire State Development counted 319 net new jobs in the report. A separate part of the report shows jobs created at any point during the calendar year. No six-month requirement applies to this count. That means any job filled in the second half of 2015 was counted in this number - but not included in the net new job count because it did not reach the six month mark by the end of the year. By that way of counting, the state reported 332 jobs created in 2015. Counting the jobs So the 319 net new jobs in the report are jobs filled at any point during the 2014 calendar year or in the first half of 2015. The 332 jobs created are new, full-time positions companies reported creating during the entire 2015 calendar year. We reached out to Liazon Corp., which expanded in Buffalo under Start-Up NY. Liazon confirmed this is its explanation for why it reported more net new jobs than jobs created in 2015. Our ruling Schimminger said at an economic development hearing in Albany that Empire State Development reported "wrong numbers from the companies" in Start-Up NY. So the report included "a significant number of overcounts in the compilation," he said. Empire State Development did not provide guidance on how to read the report, so anyone not privy to state definitions of certain terms may have come to the same conclusion as the assembly member. Schimminger, of course, is not just anyone.

pomt-11884	What Republicans call the "death tax" is the estate tax "on the ultra wealthy" which, in 2016, was paid by only "two out of every 1,000 people."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/oct/27/mark-pocan/death-tax-republicans-want-repeal-paid-only-2-1000/	Ripping the sweeping tax reforms pushed by President Donald Trump and other leading Republicans, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, singled out the provision to eliminate the "death tax." In an Oct. 18, 2017, appearance on a talk show on Janesville’s WCLO radio, Pocan said: They (Republicans) go about getting rid of the estate tax -- which, to me, is the one that I wish more people would really understand. They’ve done a good of marketing it as a "death tax" -- you die and you get taxed. But the reality is, it’s a tax on the ultra-wealthy that the vast majority of people will never, ever, ever see in their life. Last year, two out of every 1,000 people paid an estate tax. So it’s not like a common tax that’s out there. With the overall reform gaining momentum from a Senate vote the day after Pocan’s claim, and a House vote a week later, let’s see if his statistic is correct. Aimed at the rich? There is debate about how the rich are treated by the reform proposal, which at this stage is considered only a framework, since it lacks details. We’ve rated as Mostly False a claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Janesville Republican who represents the congressional district that borders Pocan’s. Ryan said the framework, which he supports, is focused on tax breaks for the middle class "and not about people who are really high-income earners getting a tax break." The framework does offer some benefits for the middle class, but what’s more clear is there are specific provisions benefiting the wealthy. As for what is conventionally known as the estate tax, the Trump administration uses the term "death tax" (as do Ryan and other Republicans) in promoting how the framework would repeal the tax. Trump himself claimed ending the tax would "protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer." But PolitiFact National’s rating was Pants on Fire: Only 5,460 estates even pay the tax each year, with only 80 being small businesses or farms. Pocan’s figure The Internal Revenue Service tells us the estate tax "is a tax on your right to transfer property at your death. It consists of an accounting of everything you own or have certain interests in at the date of death" -- including cash and securities, real estate, insurance, trusts, business interests and other assets. In 2016, the year cited in Pocan’s claim, an unmarried individual’s estate was potentially taxable only if the estate’s value exceeded $5.45 million. (The value had to exceed $10.9 million to be taxable, if there was a surviving spouse.) After deductions, such estates generally are taxed at 40 percent. IRS figures show there were 12,411 estate tax returns filed in 2016 -- but a tax was owed on only 5,219 of them. That smaller figure aligns with what PolitiFact National found. And the non-profit Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center makes a similar estimate for 2017: 5,460 estates owing a tax.) In 2016, those 5,219 estates paid a total estate tax of $18.3 billion. Since annual estate tax filings include deaths that occur in previous years, the Tax Policy Center says that each year, there are roughly 5,000 estates that pay the federal estate tax out of roughly 2.6 million deaths each year. That comes to 2 of every 1,000. Point of view on the tax While he doesn’t dispute the statistics, Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, told us there are other points to consider regarding the estate tax, saying: The estate tax affects far more people than the relatively small number who pay. Many people who own businesses and/or investments have to spend a lot of time and money on lawyers/accountants planning to avoid it. A substantial portion of the life insurance industry exists only to avoid the estate tax. And, indeed, that is an important criticism: it is one of the most inefficient taxes in the sense that the ratio of paperwork/avoidance to tax collections is very high …. The estate tax is anti-saving and anti-investment. It encourages wealthy folks to consume their wealth before death because, if the rate is high, they don’t want the government to grab it. For the rest of us, it would be better if wealthy people kept their money invested in the economy, because that spurs growth. It’s better for us if the wealthy hold large pools of savings rather than going out and buying expensive cars and yachts. A high estate tax rate encourages them to go out and buy expensive cars and yachts, which does nothing for long term economic growth. Our rating Pocan says that what Republicans call the "death tax" is the estate tax "on the ultra wealthy" which, in 2016, was paid by only "two out of every 1,000 people." Republicans who are proposing to eliminate the estate tax do use the "death tax" term. In 2016, the tax, generally 40 percent, applied only to estates worth $5.45 million or more. After deductions, the tax was paid by only about two out of every 1,000 people who died.

pomt-08587	"One of the other inaccuracies ... is that we have raised taxes multiple times and run up the budget. Absolutely not true. One tax increase since I’ve been in office. It was a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area only."	false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/24/susan-latvala/pinellas-county-commissioner-susan-latvala-says-sh/	Pinellas County Commissioner Susan Latvala has been forced to defend her record on taxes as she tries to fend off attacks from challenger Bob Hackworth, who is looking to unseat her in the Nov. 2 election. At a Dunedin candidates forum on Sept. 14, Latvala contradicted Hackworth directly on her votes for property tax rate increases. "One of the other inaccuracies, and there were many and I’m not going to address all of them, is that we have raised taxes multiple times and run up the budget. Absolutely not true," Latvala told the crowd. "One tax increase since I’ve been in office. It was a quarter mill tax in the unincorporated area only." Hackworth has criticized Latvala for voting for tax rate increases when he didn’t as a city commissioner in Dunedin. The county took advantage of rising property values that already were increasing revenue to Pinellas, he said. We wondered: Who is right? Latvala referred to a vote for the 2002-03 budget involving the municipal services taxing unit, which is a property tax paid only by residents who live in unincorporated areas of Pinellas. In August 2002, she was part of 6-1 vote to raise the property tax rate, meeting records show. Discussion at the time focused on increasing revenue to pay for recreation and other services. Latvala misstated the size of the hike. The rate increased a half-mill, not a quarter-mill, from $1.856 per $1,000 of taxable property value to $2.356. At the same meeting in which the County Commission raised the unincorporated property tax rate, it also raised a different tax, a 5.1 percent increase of the telecommunications services tax. And a year earlier, meeting records show that Latvala voted with the majority to increase the property tax rate countywide. It was a small increase, from $6.75 per $1,000 of property to $6.801, but an increase nonetheless. She did vote to raise taxes more than once during her nearly 10 years on the commission. "I goofed," Latvala said, when confronted with the records. So we rate Latvala’s claim as False.	None	Susan Latvala	None	None	None	2010-09-24T20:03:18	2010-09-14	['None']
pomt-03562	A referendum "gives the people the chance to decide" on cutting the Milwaukee County Board budget by two-thirds	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/22/leah-vukmir/state-senator-says-referendum-county-board-broad/	After state Senate approval of a bill to greatly curtail the Milwaukee County Board, Republican backers scoffed at Democratic Party critics who said the legislation trampled on local control. One Milwaukee-area Republican, state Senator Leah Vukmir of Wauwatosa, said the accusation "couldn’t be further from the truth." "This measure is ultimately about local control and gives Milwaukee County taxpayers a choice," a Vukmir news release said May 15, 2013, a day after the 19-14 Senate vote. "We are giving the citizens of the county the voice to say exactly how the county board will operate." Specifically, Vukmir said the bill mandates an April 2014 referendum in which Milwaukee County voters will determine if the County Board’s budget is cut by two-thirds and board supervisors’ pay is cut in half. "If the referendum passes, supervisor pay would be reduced to around $24,000, health insurance and pension benefits would no longer exist and the county board budget would be reduced from $6 million to $2 million," her release said. "The referendum gives the people the chance to decide..." The referendum question on supervisors’ pay was familiar to us, but would voters also get the chance to decide whether the County Board’s budget falls by two thirds? The bill authored by Republican state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo changed as it worked its way from drafting through passage to the desk of Gov. Scott Walker, a former Milwaukee County executive who is expected to sign it. But the fundamentals haven’t changed since Sanfelippo unveiled his first draft in January 2013. From the get-go, the West Allis representative wanted voters to decide on trimming Milwaukee County supervisors' pay. The initial proposal was a cut from $50,679 to $15,000 a year. In the bill’s final version, the April 2014 referendum still deals with supervisors’ pay, but the pay cut is smaller -- about 50%, reducing the salary to about $24,000. The precise pay is tied to per-capita income in Milwaukee County. If voters approve the pay cut, supervisors would lose health and pension benefits. But a reading of the final bill shows that county voters will not be asked whether the County Board’s budget should be cut by two-thirds under a budget-capping formula outlined in the bill. There is no referendum on the budget cap, contrary to what Vukmir’s May 15 release stated. That’s been true since Sanfelippo first went public with a draft in mid-January. A Journal Sentinel story on his announcement was headlined: "A $5 million cut to County Board budget won’t go before voters." (The cut initially was larger than in the final bill; it’s now about $4 million). Bottom line: The bulk of the hoped-for $4 million savings annually in the County Board budget would be accomplished if Walker signs the legislation -- without voters weighing in. Similarly, without requiring voters to sign off, the bill requires supervisors to stand for election every two years instead of every four, and scales back the board’s role in contracts, land sales and labor negotiations, as the Journal Sentinel reported. Vukmir aide Jason Booth blamed confusion about the contents of the bill for the error on the scope of the referendum. Proponents of the bill, including current Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele and top Milwaukee business leaders, say it would restore authority to the county executive’s office and streamline county decision-making. Sanfelippo has claimed his bill puts Milwaukee County Board spending in line with other major counties. We rated that statement Mostly True. Sanfelippo, himself a former Milwaukee County Board member, thinks supervisors should be part-time citizen legislators starting in 2016. But others see the legislation as an anti-democratic power grab that will put too much power in the executive branch. "With the long history of Milwaukee County Executives abusing their power, this bill is a dangerous step in the wrong direction, Senate Democratic Leader Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, said upon passage. "Unfortunately, this bill flies in the face of the trust in the people of Milwaukee County and our Democratic system." Our rating Vukmir contended that Milwaukee County voters would decide whether the County Board budget takes a big cut. That’s wrong. A referendum would determine County Board supervisors’ pay, but most of the changes in the bill -- including the County Board’s budget level -- would take effect directly through the legislation, without voter approval in 2014. We rate her claim False.	None	Leah Vukmir	None	None	None	2013-05-22T09:00:00	2013-05-15	['None']
pomt-07740	Says signs posted at projects funded by the federal stimulus act has cost "20 or 40 million" dollars.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/28/jim-renacci/rep-jim-renacci-says-signs-stimulus-projects-cost-/	Signs of economic recovery can be elusive. The Federal Highway Administration tried to help, in its own way, by encouraging road signs at stimulus-funded highway projects that state: "Putting America to Work. Project Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act." As far back as July 2009, Republican legislators and some Democrats criticized the signs as wasteful. Sarah Palin, speaking at a Tea Party convention a year ago, claimed that one state alone -- Ohio -- spent $1 million on stimulus signs. PolitiFact rated that claim as Half True, finding that the figure was a suspect and almost certainly exaggerated estimate. But the issue did not go away. When Rep. Jim Renacci was asked during a recent radio interview where the federal budget could be cut, he said: "I'll give you a small item that I see on the highway every day. It's the signs that say 'This is the recovery act.' I think it was $20 or $40 million in signage." PolitiFact Ohio couldn't help being interested in an estimate with a range of 100 percent. We asked where the 16th District Republican got his figures, and did some looking of our own. The congressman's press secretary, Karin Davenport, cited a figure from Rep. Aaron Schock, an Illinois Republican. He introduced a bill last July requiring agencies to report what they already had spent on signs and prohibiting funding for more. "Reports have stated these signs can cost taxpayers up to $10,000," Schock said, "and my home state of Illinois has spent over $650,000 on these signs. That’s roughly $20 million spent nationwide, without creating one single job." Where did Schock get the number? His communications director, Steve Dutton, told us, "The number comes from several sources of information, including information reported by individual states, independent reporters (some amounts included up to $200 million) and several ranges from the White House. "The White House initially said the cost was around $5 million and then they came back with $10 million, but the accounting for the actual cost is somewhat difficult as the way the stimulus bill was written it didn't require states to have to account for the costs of the signs. Several states did account for the cost, but not all of them did. There was a CNN story on the costs of the signs in Ohio." That put us back where we started. The CNN story, from a year ago, used the $1 million Ohio figure that PolitiFact found suspect and likely exaggerated. The story also said that CNN "found most states are spending stimulus money on signs and that could cost taxpayers nationwide about $3.8 million." House Republican Whip Eric Cantor, supporting Schock's bill, said "no information exists as to how much all of these signs cost taxpayers, but reports indicate that potentially tens of millions of dollars have been spent." Schock sits on the House Subcommittee on Oversight. The full committee's ranking Republican and chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, last year called the stimulus signs "propaganda" and made them a particular target. Last June, he asked the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to investigate the total cost of recovery act signs in six agencies: the Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency and General Services Administration. The six agencies reported spending about $9 million total on signs, though they relied on only a sampling of projects for their estimates. The Department of Transportation spent the most, $8,154,000. The reported per-sign cost ranged from "negligible" (adding a recovery act logo to a sign that would have been posted anyway) to $1,950. "I can't remember this issue coming up since then," the communications director for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, Edward Pound, told us. "I think that's the extent of it." But Issa complained that the reporting was inadequate. He and Republicans on the oversight committee asked the public to "track down" and photograph "propaganda signs" (which they said cost as much as $20 million), posting them online under the banner "Signs of a failed stimulus." The website says the signs cost "potentially" and "up to" $192 million. No basis is provided for that figure. Calling it a "potential" cost makes it a theoretical high end, not an estimate. Sam Rosen-Amy, a budget and fiscal transparency policy analyst with OMB Watch, said making any estimate would be difficult because signs are not mandated on projects, some signs are used on multiple projects and the per-sign cost varies widely. The recovery board doesn't track the cost of signage. So we end where we started: Whether the signs are useful or wasteful is something for legislators and the public to decide. The $1 million figure for signs in Ohio was suspect a year ago, and it remains a big part of the foundation for later estimates. There’s an element of accuracy in Renacci’s statement. The cost of the signs nationally has run into the millions. But although some huge numbers have been cited, no one was able to document an exact figure. And when agencies putting the signs up were asked to investigate the costs, their estimates tallied up to less than half of Renacci’s figures. That’s an important detail the listener needs to put things in proper context, and on the Truth-O-Meter that means we rate the congressman’s claim as Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-04547	Says "you cannot implement Paul Ryan’s plan without allowing for any increases in revenue."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/28/kasim-reed/kasim-reed-says-numbers-dont-work-paul-ryans-budge/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been racking up the frequent-flier miles lately to travel to Washington to advocate for President Barack Obama on the long-running television program "Meet the Press." During Reed’s most recent appearance, the mayor frequently criticized Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The mayor also attempted to carve up GOP running mate Paul Ryan’s proposal to cut the federal budget deficit. "[T]o get a budget deal, we have to have revenue-raising measures. You cannot implement Paul Ryan's plan while not allowing for any increases in revenue," Reed, a Democrat, said on the program Sunday. We wondered whether Reed is right. Can cuts be made to levels that Ryan has proposed without raising taxes or finding other ways to increase revenue? Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has made several proposals to curb federal spending and maintain the viability of entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. Ryan has said his budget could cut the deficit by as much as $5 trillion over 10 years. The mayor’s office said Reed disagrees with Ryan’s plan from a policy perspective and he doesn’t believe it will pass in Congress. Reed and nearly 150 mayors across America signed a letter dated Sept. 21 that was written to congressional leaders in both parties urging them to pass legislation as soon as possible with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases to address the nation’s budget deficit. Romney campaign officials responded to our request for comment about the Ryan plan. Romney has said he agrees with much of what Ryan has proposed, with a few tweaks. The campaign forwarded us several studies that support Romney’s argument that his plan can be done with no tax increases. "The Romney-Ryan plan would lower rates for all taxpayers while eliminating loopholes and carve-outs in the tax code," Romney spokesman Brendan Buck said. "This will bring in additional revenue through economic growth, rather than tax hikes as the president has proposed." The Romney camp pointed us to an article by Martin Feldstein, former head of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Ronald Reagan, to bolster its argument. Feldstein wrote in The Wall Street Journal in August that "it is feasible to combine tax cuts and base broadening as Gov. Romney suggests without raising the budget deficit or imposing any middle-class tax increase." David Stockman, who was a director of the Office of Management and Budget under Reagan, said the Ryan plan does not go deep enough on the spending side and does not offer enough detail about how it would broaden the tax base. "In short, Mr. Ryan’s plan is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices," Stockman wrote in The New York Times. The latest version of the Ryan plan, written March 20, would repeal the federal health care law, cut the federal workforce by 10 percent by 2015, convert the federal share of Medicaid spending into block grants, allow more private-sector competition for Medicare coverage in an effort to lower costs and employ other cost-cutting measures. To grow the economy, Ryan has proposed cutting tax rates (to 10 percent and 25 percent) and reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent to encourage investment and discretionary spending. Ryan says his plan, titled Path to Prosperity, would cut the deficit by $5 trillion over the next 10 years and balance the budget by 2050. The national debt is currently $16 trillion. Ryan says federal revenue would nearly double in 10 years, from $2.44 trillion to $4.6 trillion. Obama’s plan calls for a mix of less-intensive spending cuts and a tax increase on the wealthiest earners. Ryan mentions closing tax loopholes in his plan, but there are few specifics. Ryan has said in interviews that a Romney administration would have an open debate with Congress about loopholes. "Now the question is not necessarily what loopholes go, but who gets them?" Ryan said during an ABC News interview. "High-income earners use most of the loopholes. That means they can shelter their income from taxation." The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which reviews fiscal plans for Congress, has examined the Ryan plan. The federal government would collect less revenue under the plan than under its baseline projections. The government, though, would spend less under the plan. The deficit would be slightly less under the plan, the CBO concluded. Still, the CBO said in a March 2012 report that projections for revenue are "highly uncertain" for many reasons. The federal Congressional Research Service published a study in September that examined whether there has been a cause and effect between lowering tax rates and economic growth. The study began by looking at tax rates since 1945 because most American families did not file a tax return before World War II. It concluded "that changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal tax rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear correlated with economic growth." Reed’s office says Ryan’s plan is not feasible, citing CBO research and criticism by New York Times columnists David Brooks, a conservative, and Paul Krugman, a liberal and Nobel Prize-winning economics professor who called it "absurd" because of how it would reduce discretionary spending. "Ryan’s plan envisions cutting $6 trillion from federal spending over the next 10 years, but it would eliminate or slash so many programs that the federal government would be unrecognizable," the mayor’s office told us via email. Diane Lim Rogers, chief economist of the Virginia-based Concord Coalition, a bipartisan organization created in the 1990s to alert the public about the federal deficit, said the Ryan plan lacks specifics. She cited the CRS report, saying "tax cuts are not a reliable way to raise revenue." To sum up, the mayor said, "You cannot implement Paul Ryan’s plan without allowing for any increases in revenue." Reed’s argument is strengthened by some of the nonpartisan historical research on tax cuts and its impact on the economy, as well as Ryan’s statements that he would propose ending some loopholes, which is another form of increasing revenue. But even critics of Ryan’s plan say there is a path to the deficit reduction the congressman has proposed, though Reed and others may not like cuts that would be required to line up with the revenue projections. PolitiFact Georgia thought long and hard about this one. In the end, we rate the mayor’s statement Half True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2012-09-28T06:00:00	2012-09-23	['None']

"Bill Gates Outlines 2018 Plan To Depopulate The Planet," said an April 30 post on mysterious-times.com, filed under its "Conspiracy" category. The post’s supposed evidence includes efforts by Gates and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to research, develop and deliver vaccines to help reduce child mortality. It claimed Gates "has doubled down on his goal to depopulate the planet, using deceitful Orwellian doublespeak in a new video to bamboozle his naive followers into believing that ‘by making people healthier, we can reduce the world’s population.’" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. "Make no mistake, when Gates talks about ‘making people healthier,’ what he is really talking about is enforcing the mandatory rollout of his range of experimental vaccinations. The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents," the post said. It also claimed that vaccinations promoted in India by the Gates Foundation "were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls" and that it conducted experimental vaccine trials. But PunditFact in December 2016 debunked a post on an anti-vaccine blog claiming Gates used "30,000 Indian girls as guinea pigs to test cancer" and that vaccination efforts led to deaths. That Pants on Fire post was a mash-up of outdated, disproven rumors. Mysterious Times doesn’t offer many details about its website, but the About section of its Facebook page says: "Aliens UFOs, Conspiracy and Weird Stuff." Gates does not seek to "depopulate" the planet, but believes saving children’s lives can help reduce population growth. When children survive, families decide to have fewer children and that "can lead to a burst of economic growth that economists call ‘the demographic dividend,’ " Gates said in the 2018 edition of the annual letter he co-writes with his wife, Melinda. "When more children live, you get one generation that’s relatively big. Then, when families decide to have fewer children, the next generation is much smaller. Eventually, a country ends up with relatively more people in the labor force producing economically—and relatively fewer dependents (very old or very young people)," Bill Gates said in the 2018 letter. "That’s a recipe for rapid economic development, especially if countries take advantage of it by investing in health and education." We rate Mysterious Times’ post Pants on Fire!

pomt-04968	The state of Georgia has lost 200,000 total jobs and 50,000 construction jobs since May 2007.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/25/kasim-reed/The-mayor-gets-the-numbers-right-on-jobs-lost/	For the past two years, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has been one of the most vocal advocates in support of a regional sales tax to pay for more than 150 transportation projects he and proponents say will ease congestion in the region. Supporters also say the 1 percent tax would jolt the region’s economy by creating jobs for people working on those transportation projects. An earlier claim by tax proponents said that the plan will "create or support an additional 200,000 new jobs." PolitiFact found that number gave an inflated impression of the plan's impact, and the jobs-creation claim earned a Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter. Critics say the tax will benefit construction companies and the well-connected, but do little to untangle the region’s transportation gridlock. Reed’s statement concerned only the number of jobs lost in the economic downturn. The mayor was very vocal about the need for more jobs during a news conference at City Hall to announce the Atlanta Business League’s support for the July 31 referendum. The sales tax could raise $8.5 billion over 10 years, after inflation. "The city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia, we’ve lost 200,000 jobs since the year 2007," Reed began. "We’ve lost 50,000 construction jobs since the year 2007." We wanted to know if hizzoner has potential as a labor economist. Or are the mayor’s numbers incorrect? PolitiFact Georgia went to the most commonly used and dependable source of labor data, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For our purposes, we focused on state employment figures. First, the overall employment numbers. In May 2012, the most recent monthly BLS data available, an estimated 3,930,000 Georgians were employed. In May 2007, the number of Georgians employed 4,139,000, the federal data shows. The difference is 209,000 people. So far, so good for the mayor. Now, what about the construction data? In May 2007, the BLS said about 222,700 Georgians were employed in the construction industry. In May 2012, the number dropped to an estimated 141,300 Georgians. The difference: 81,400. That’s actually more people who’ve lost their jobs in construction than Reed said at the City Hall event. Real estate has long been a bedrock industry in metro Atlanta with the region’s rapid population growth in recent decades. The Great Recession hurt the real estate industry tremendously. Construction levels dropped nearly 80 percent between 2006 -- its peak year -- and 2010, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2011. The federal data shows construction employment declined each month between August 2007 and September 2010. Employment rose for a few months in early 2011, but has largely declined since. As for the overall employment numbers, the decline since 2007 also has been largely blamed on the recession. The number of Georgians employed has increased by about 92,000 since May 2010, the BLS numbers show. Reed’s overall point is that the region could use the jobs that might be created by these transportation projects. And it is uncertain how many jobs the projects would create. But the jobs-loss numbers Reed used to back up his argument were correct for the number of total jobs lost since 2007. Reed actually underestimated the total of jobs lost since 2007 in the construction industry. Overall, we rate his statement as True.

Michele Bachmann made a claim that jolted us out of our seats. "After the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true," she said. It came during an exchange between Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Bachmann was attacking Gingrich’s work after he left Congress. He has said he was a paid consultant, but critics such as Bachmann contend he was really a lobbyist. Gingrich defended his work on behalf of the government-sponsored mortgage-bundling giant Freddie Mac, arguing that government does not necessarily taint whatever enterprise it touches. He added, "I did no lobbying of any kind for any organization. That was a key part of every agreement we had." Challenged by moderator Chris Wallace for hard evidence, Bachmann said that "we know that (Gingrich) cashed paychecks from Freddie Mac. That’s the best evidence that you can have. Over $1.6 million. … The speaker had his hand out and he was taking $1.6 million to influence senior Republicans to keep the scam going in Washington, D.C. That’s absolutely wrong. We can’t have as our nominee for the Republican party someone who continues to stand for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. They need to be shut down, not built up." Gingrich responded, "Well, the easiest answer is, that's just not true. What she just said is factually not true. I never lobbied under any circumstance. I never went in and suggested in any way that we do this. In fact, I tried to help defeat the housing act when the Democrats were in charge of the House. And if you go back and talk to former Congressman Rick Lazio, he'll tell you, when we were passing housing reform while I was speaker, I never at any time tried to slow down the reform effort. In fact, I helped him pass the reform bill. And I think some of those people ought to have facts before they make wild allegations." At that point, Bachmann jumped back in. "Well, after the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true. And the evidence is that Speaker Gingrich took $1.6 million. You don't need to be within the technical definition of being a lobbyist to still be influence-peddling with senior Republicans in Washington, D.C., to get them to do your bidding." Wait... what? We said that "everything" Bachmann had said was true? Actually, that's not what we said. At the Dec. 10 debate she was referring to, PolitiFact checked two claims from Bachmann and rated them Mostly True and Pants on Fire. The fact-check she may have been referencing was, "In 1993, Newt Gingrich ‘first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating’ for it." We rated that one a Mostly True. But we also rated her claim that Mitt Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, "put into place socialized medicine." We found that was ridiculously false and rated it Pants on Fire. Her comment about our ratings was also a bit of a non-sequitur. Neither of the two items we checked addressed the subject at hand -- Gingrich’s work for Freddie Mac, what he thinks of Freddie Mac today, or whether Gingrich was ever a lobbyist. Maybe Bachmann was simply trying to burnish her image as a truth teller. However, using PolitiFact to back up that assertion is a bit unusual. Her PolitiFact report card shows 59 percent of her statements rated have earned either a False or Pants on Fire. She has earned five Trues, three Mostly Trues, six Half Trues, seven Mostly Falses, 19 Falses and 11 Pants on Fires. Our ruling During the Sioux City debate, Bachmann said that "after the debate that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything I said was true." That’s simply not the case. We rated two statements by Bachmann from that debate and ruled one of them Mostly True and the other one Pants on Fire. So for claiming she had a perfect record, she earns another Pants on Fire.

pomt-02170	Welcome to Wisconsin road signs have "always been made in Wisconsin," but Scott Walker "is outsourcing them" to an out-of-state company and "paying more money for them."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/30/mike-tate/scott-walker-outsourced-making-welcome-wisconsin-r/	Two weeks after taking office in January 2011, Gov. Scott Walker augmented the familiar Wisconsin-shaped signs at the state’s borders that say: "Wisconsin Welcomes You." Employing his campaign theme, Walker attached small horizontal signs that read, "Open for Business." The state paid a suburban Milwaukee company $1,495 to make the attachments to the 10-feet-tall and 11-feet-wide brown signs. Three years later, on April 18, 2014, the signs were raised by Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate, who appeared on a Madison-area radio station to comment on Walker's re-election announcement. Tate criticized the Republican's record on creating jobs, then ridiculed him. "The signs on our border that say 'Welcome to Wisconsin' -- they've always been made in Wisconsin," Tate told liberal talk show host John "Sly" Sylvester. "But now Scott Walker's DOA (Department of Administration) is outsourcing them -- I think to a company in Illinois, of all places -- and they're paying more money for them." Really? A governor who is almost certain to break his promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term decides to have an out-of-state company make "Welcome to Wisconsin" signs -- at a higher price to the state? As we’ll see, Tate's statement from the beginning goes down the wrong road. Which signs? When we asked Democratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff for evidence to back Tate's claim, she said Tate "may have erred" on the type of highway sign he singled out. Indeed, Tate is simply wrong in referring to the "Wisconsin Welcomes You" signs -- those 23 signs are not being replaced. Rather, Baldauff provided a few news articles about the state Department of Transportation deciding to change vendors on a contract for maintenance of a different type of sign -- the ubiquitous and much smaller blue signs near highway and freeway exits throughout the state that alert motorists to gas stations, restaurants and other businesses. Those signs typically carry the businesses’ logos. According to the DOT, the Legislature created the so-called specific information signs program in 1990 to promote certain types of businesses within five miles of a highway. The program is designed to be self-funded -- in other words, the businesses, not taxpayers, pay the cost of building and maintaining the blue signs. That's an important point. Not only was Tate wrong in saying Walker was "outsourcing" the construction of the brown "Wisconsin Welcomes You" signs, he was wrong in suggesting that the outsourcing -- which actually refers to the maintenance of the blue roadway signs that promote businesses -- is being done at a higher cost to taxpayers. Here’s what led up to Tate’s claim: The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in February 2014 that after 28 years of Milwaukee-based Derse-Wisconsin Highway Business Signs holding the blue signs contract, DOT had decided to give its next contract to Georgia-based Interstate Logos. DOT said Interstate Logos, which is subcontracting with a Portage, Wis., firm for part of the work, scored higher in the bid process that had been set up and would provide better signs and better service. As for the costs to businesses, Derse had proposed to charge $21 a month for signs along the interstate -- a reduction from the $30 it had charged for years -- and the same $10 a month it had been charging for signs along exit ramps. Meanwhile, Interstate Logos proposed charging $46 per month for signs on the interstate, but no additional charge for signs on ramps. After DOT decided to give the contract to Interstate Logos, however, the company agreed to use $30 and $10 fees that Derse had been using. A 10-year contract was put in place to start May 1, 2014. So, businesses aren’t facing a higher price under the new contract. And none of that is paid by taxpayers. Our rating Criticizing Walker’s record on job creation, Tate said Welcome to Wisconsin road signs have "always been made in Wisconsin," but Walker "is outsourcing them" to an out-of-state company and "paying more money for them." No changes are being made to the large "Wisconsin Welcomes You" signs near the state’s borders. The state did give a sign maintenance contract to a Georgia firm, but businesses -- not state taxpayers -- pay for those small roadway signs and the prices in the contract are not increasing. We rate Tate’s statement False. Comment on this item at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.	None	Mike Tate	None	None	None	2014-04-30T05:00:00	2014-04-18	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']
pomt-03311	The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is "collecting financial information, monitoring financial information of millions of Americans" without their knowledge and "storing it for up to 10 years."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/29/sean-duffy/us-agency-monitoring-millions-americans-financial-/	Seizing on revelations that the National Security Agency has been scooping up the phone and Internet communications of ordinary Americans, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., is sounding new alarms about citizen surveillance by another, relatively new government agency. In a July 17, 2013 interview on "Opinion Journal," a Wall Street Journal online show, he invoked the National Security Agency in making his attack on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. "The CFPB is collecting financial information, monitoring financial information, of millions of Americans, and they have no clue that it’s going on. It’s again this NSA push of having more information on more Americans," Duffy said. He added: "We know in politics, oftentimes people will sample data, to see what the president’s approval rating is or disapproval rating is. The CFPB could do the same thing to find out information about financial transactions. But instead of sampling data, they’re actually collecting it and storing it for up to 10 years. This is absolutely crazy." So, Duffy’s claim is that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau collects and monitors financial information of millions of Americans, without their knowledge, and stores it for up to 10 years -- the implication being that bureau is keeping data on individuals’ personal accounts. Let's do some information gathering of our own. What CFPB does The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which launched in July 2011, is charged with protecting consumers from abusive practices in financial services and regulating the terms of mortgages, student loans, credit cards and other transactions. "We gather and analyze available information to better understand consumers, financial services providers and consumer financial markets," the bureau says. For example, a bureau report in June 2013 found that overdraft penalties represent well over half of banks' fees from consumer checking accounts, The law creating the bureau prohibits it from collecting data "for purposes of gathering or analyzing the personally identifiable financial information of consumers." But that doesn’t personally identifiable information isn’t being collected. A disclosure Suspicion about the bureau’s work ratcheted up in April 2013 when Bloomberg News reported it was demanding records from banks and was buying anonymous information about at least 10 million consumers from various companies. The article said the bureau was paying the Experian credit-monitoring company up to $8.4 million to provide data on 5 million to 10 million consumers. The bureau was also buying auto loan information from the company and payday loan data from another credit-reporting company, the article said. Duffy spokeswoman Cassie Smedile also pointed out that the bureau’s April 2013 strategic plan says the bureau will "acquire and maintain a credit card database at the summary and loan levels covering approximately 80 percent of the credit card marketplace." So, the first part of Duffy’s claim is accurate. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is obtaining from third parties financial data involving millions of Americans without any direct notification from the bureau to consumers. But what about the rest of Duffy’s message, which suggests the bureau keeps financial data on actual individuals, monitors it and stores it for up to 10 years? Bureau makes its case A week before Duffy made his claim, the House Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit held a hearing specifically to examine how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau collects and uses consumer data. Duffy is a member of the committee. The bureau’s acting deputy director, Stephen Antonakes, testified that the bureau’s data collection on individuals is very limited. The bureau collects personally identifiable information only when consumers are seeking help with a complaint against a business, he said, or when "we're using our supervisory tool, conducting examinations of the banks, the credit unions and the nonbanks under our jurisdiction." When Duffy asked about news indicating the bureau was buying information about at least 10 million consumers, Antonakes replied: "Congressman, we're not monitoring any individual American. We're collecting broad data on markets to understand how varied markets work." At the same time, Antonakes said he didn’t know how many millions of Americans were involved in the data the bureau has collected. And he said the bureau needs years’ worth of complete data, not a sampling of data like pollsters might use, to do its work. Duffy’s evidence We asked Duffy’s spokeswoman for evidence that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was monitoring data on individual Americans and storing it for up to 10 years. She cited a July 2013 lawsuit filed against the bureau by a firm that says it is fighting the bureau’s demand for "thousands of personally identifiable" financial documents of individuals considering bankruptcy. The documents contain data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, amount of debt owed and creditor information, the firm alleges in a news release in which Duffy is quoted. Duffy’s spokeswoman also cited a contract -- revealed by the Judicial Watch conservative group, which litigates on public corruption and other issues -- that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has with a firm to store and analyze credit card information. The firm can get access to "non-public confidential information and personally identifiable information," the contract says, although the firm is barred from disclosing any of the data to any third party without permission from the bureau. The contract also states that "most if not all" of the data the firm will handle will be "confidential supervisory information," but that some records will contain sensitive, personally identifiable information. Judicial Watch has published documents from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau showing the bureau wants to track the financial records of 5 million Americans. The bureau acknowledged the program and said all data collected is "anonymized," according to a U.S. News & World Report article. Other evidence We put Duffy’s claim to Bradley Jansen, director of the Center for Financial Privacy and Human Rights in Washington, D.C., which says it defends privacy, civil liberties and market economics, and Florida attorney Justin Angelo, who represents banks and other businesses that are regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They agreed the bureau has collected and is monitoring financial data involving millions of Americans, but that’s not the same as monitoring the financial activity of individuals. They also agreed it’s likely the bureau cannot collect all of the data it does without obtaining personally identifiable information in the process, even if the data is not being collected for that reason. How the bureau is collecting data and safeguarding it will be the focus of a government audit. On July 12, 2013, three days after the House subcommittee hearing on the bureau’s data collection practices, the U.S. Government Accountability Office agreed to review the bureau’s collection and analysis of credit records. U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who requested the review, says some of the bureau’s contracts with third-party data collectors would enable the bureau to monitor an individual consumer’s financial activity on a monthly basis. But Crapo has also said the GAO review is needed because it’s unclear what personally identifiable information is being kept by the bureau. He said: "While CFPB officials have stated the CFPB is not collecting personally identifiable information, we do not know what information it collects, on how many accounts, or how this information is being used. We also need to know whether the CFPB is truly not collecting personally identifiable information from the data it is collecting or purchasing." It’s worth noting that when Crapo raised similar concerns two months earlier, bureau director Richard Cordray responded in part by saying that while the bureau is creating a national mortgage database with "loan-level" data, and had bought 10 years of credit data representing 4 percent of Americans, none of that data contains personally identifiable information. Our rating Invoking the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency, Duffy said the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is "collecting financial information, monitoring financial information of millions of Americans" without their knowledge and "storing it for up to 10 years." The implication was that bureau is keeping data on millions of individuals’ personal accounts. The bureau is collecting information, even 10 years’ worth of some data, involving millions of Americans. That’s being done through third parties without consumers’ knowledge But even a critic who has made claims similar to Duffy’s, in asking for a review of the bureau, says he doesn’t know what information the bureau collects and whether it contains personally identifiable information. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Duffy a Half True.	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2013-07-29T05:00:00	2013-07-17	['United_States']
pomt-07195	"For every $1 spent on mitigation, $4 in post-storm cleanup and rebuilding is saved."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/08/tom-rooney/rooney-claims-1-spent-disaster-mitigation-saves-4-/	A day after the June 1 start of hurricane season, U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican whose Florida district includes parts of both the east and west coasts, introduced three bills related to insurance premiums or mitigation from hurricanes and other disasters. In a June 2 press release, he summarized the bills. One of them, the National Disaster Mitigation Act, would provide a tax credit up to $5,000 for homeowners who prepare their homes to reduce the risk of damage from hurricanes and other disasters. That mitigation could include roof repairs or adding shutters, for example. "Mitigation must be a priority," Rooney wrote. "Too many families and homes remain unnecessarily vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes. While mitigation will never eliminate the risk to homeowners, it could reduce loss and, in many cases, save a family’s home. For every $1 spent on mitigation, $4 in post-storm cleanup and rebuilding is saved. These tax credits would provide an important incentive for families to proactively protect their homes from natural disasters." For this Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to check if Rooney's figure was correct: For every $1 spent on mitigation, is $4 in post-storm cleanup and rebuilding saved? We contacted Rooney spokesman Michael Mahaffey to ask for Rooney's source. He told us the claim came from a 2005 study by the National Institute of Building Sciences commissioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The study was conducted by the Multihazard Mitigation Council of NIBS, which aims to improve communication among entities involved in disaster mitigation and provide credible information for public policy. The goal of the study, based on the work of more than 50 national experts, was to "assess the future savings from hazard mitigation activities." The preface of the report gets to the heart of Rooney's claim: "This study shows that money spent on reducing the risk of natural hazards is a sound investment. On average a dollar spent by FEMA on hazard mitigation (actions to reduce disaster losses) provides the nation with about $4 in future benefits." But let's look a little deeper at the study. The purpose of the study was to quantify future savings from mitigation related to losses from earthquake, wind and flood through three major FEMA mitigation programs: Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, Project Impact and the Flood Assistance Mitigation Program -- federally-funded programs that help mitigate future disasters after they happen or ahead of time. (The hazard mitigation and flood assistance programs still exist while Project Impact has since ended -- although FEMA now has other similar programs. For more about these programs, look at FEMA's website.) Two types of mitigations were addressed: "project" mitigations such as relocating homes and improving drainage, and "process" mitigations such as policies that reduce risk by developing strong building codes, for example. From page 115 of the full report: "The total benefits of FEMA hazard mitigation benefits between mid-1993 and mid-2003 are $14.0 billion compared with $3.5 billion in costs. This yields an average cost-benefit ratio of 4.0." The study looked at a statistically representative sample of FEMA-funded mitigation grants between 1993 and 2003 and assessed future savings from such mitigation. Benefits were defined as losses avoided, including property damage, business interruption and reduced cost of emergency services. We interviewed three experts involved in the 2005 study: chair Brent Woodworth, who at the time headed up IBM's crisis response team and is current CEO of the L.A. Emergency Preparedness Foundation; Dennis Mileti, senior research scientist at the National Hazard Center in Boulder, Colo.; and Timothy Reinhold, senior vice president of research and chief engineer at the Institute for Business and Home Safety in Tampa. All three said they believe the statistic would still hold true in 2011 -- though it's an average that could vary depending on the type of mitigation project and location. The study focuses on FEMA-funded mitigation. "The study's conclusions are for the nation as a whole and not for individual homeowners," Mileti wrote in an e-mail. "Taking all disaster events into account and all mitigation projects studied into account (some mitigation projects will not experience a disaster and others will), the benefit is 4 to 1 when extrapolated out into the future. Some individuals will reap the benefits (at a greater level than 4 to 1), others will not because they may not have a disaster and the general outcome for the nation as a whole is 4 to 1." In a telephone interview, Mileti explained: "You can't tell a person -- one homeowner in one town who spends thousands on shutters -- that they will end up saving $4 for every $1 they may spend." For starters, after the shutters are added, the house may not get hit with a hurricane. To study all mitigation projects -- including those funded by private companies, individual homeowners, states, counties and cities -- would be "very, very expensive and unrealistic," Mileti said. We ran the 1:4 ratio by hurricane or mitigation experts in Florida, and all of them said they either cite it, agree with it or thought it might even be higher. We checked with Miles Anderson, Florida's chief of mitigation; Chuck Lanza, director of the Broward County Emergency Management Division; Ricardo Alvarez, mitigation consultant based in Miami; and Sheridan "Butch" Truesdale, Senior Mitigation Planner for Palm Beach County. "I think it's that or greater, depending on the type of project or where it is," Anderson said. We also found the statistic cited in an August 2007 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. And when we asked FEMA, we received an unsigned e-mail from the agency's News Desk that the agency still "accepts this statistic." Rooney claimed that "for every $1 spent on mitigation, $4 spent on post-storm cleanup and rebuilding is saved." Rooney took that claim from a valid national study worked on by dozens of experts. But the ratio referred to FEMA-funded mitigation projects -- not necessarily home upgrades paid for by individual homeowners targeted in Rooney's bill. However, the ratio is widely considered to be an industry standard. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Tom Rooney	None	None	None	2011-06-08T11:23:23	2011-06-02	['None']
pomt-02388	Using a surcharge on the cigarette tax to help pay for a new downtown sports arena "is not feasible under state law."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/13/tom-barrett/mayor-tom-barrett-says-using-cigarette-tax-new-are/	The wheels are turning among Milwaukee’s civic leaders as they try to address the future of the aging BMO Harris Bradley Center. The 25-year-old facility has been described as a "senior citizen" among NBA arenas. There’s a growing sense of urgency. The lease for the Milwaukee Bucks expires in 2017, the NBA is applying pressure, and the team’s owner, former U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, is seeking additional investors in the team. Two panels of civic leaders are exploring options for the arena. So we took notice when Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett seemed to rule out one funding option -- an expansion of the cigarette tax -- that has been used in other cities to help pay for new facilities. "I don’t think that’s feasible under state law," the mayor said in a March 3, 2014 interview with Wisconsin Eye. He added: "No one has talked about that at all. I’ve never heard anybody mention that." The two panels -- a large group led by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce that's studying the region's cultural funding needs and a smaller one focused on the Bradley Center -- have just begun their work. In theory, at least, all funding options are still on the table, although some surrounding counties are on record opposing any public funding for a downtown Milwaukee arena. So is Barrett right? Does state law block an expansion of the cigarette tax? When we asked Barrett’s office for backup for his statement, spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said: "Mayor Barrett’s answer was referring to the fact that we can’t have a local cigarette tax because of state law." How it works now The state now levies a tax of $2.52 per pack of cigarettes. The tax has been around since 1939, and has been increased by the Legislature 17 times, most recently in 2009. The tax raised about $587 million in fiscal year 2011-’12, and raised as much as $644 million in fiscal year 2009-’10. (Increasing the tax, as was the case in 2009, often convinces some smokers to smoke less.) Money raised from the tax goes into general state coffers. As it stands now, Wisconsin’s cigarette tax is levied uniformly statewide. There are no local surcharges, and no means for the money to be directed to local projects. That could change, but it would take the approval of the Legislature and governor, said Sean Moran, of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Moran wrote an issue paper about the state’s alcohol and tobacco taxes last year. "There’s really no reason it couldn’t be done," he said. What has been discussed The Public Policy Forum was commissioned to study a variety of funding tools, including the cigarette tax, as part of a report that will be issued March 14, 2014. Forum president Rob Henken said in an interview that the tool was being considered because of the experience in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland. Voters there approved a 30-cent county tax on cigarettes that started in 2006 and gave it a 10-year lifespan. The tax generated about $15.6 million for local arts and culture groups. (Another 4.5 cent tax on cigarettes, part of a "sin tax" enacted in 1990 that also includes taxes on alcohol, is dedicated to funding sports facilities. Voters will decide in May whether or not to extend that tax for 20 years.) A local cigarette tax is also in place in other areas, including Cook County, Ill. Smokers there pay $2 a pack in a county tax; the city of Chicago tacks on another 68 cents. In New York state, the tax is a whopping $4.35, tops in the country. Henken said there were pluses and minuses behind using a cigarette tax for a Bradley Center replacement. On the plus side, of course, are the dollars. The report will say that if a 30-cent cigarette tax -- the same size as Cuyahoga County -- were levied in Milwaukee County, it would generate about $11.7 million a year. Obviously, that’s not enough to pay for a new stadium on its own, but it could factor into a package of revenue tools. The downside includes the argument that such a tax would penalize lower income people, because studies show they tend to smoke in greater numbers than higher income people. Also, the state’s cigarette tax is already high -- we’re No. 8 -- compared with the other 49 states, according to the Fiscal Bureau. The list is topped by New York at $4.35 a pack. Then there’s the "island" issue. Some Milwaukee County smokers would simply go elsewhere to buy their cigarettes and avoid the higher tax. In a meeting in February 2014, members of the task force looking at cultural funding needs -- not just the arena issue -- discussed the various tax options. A Journal Sentinel report on the meeting noted that panel members meeting in small groups "seemed to agree that a property-tax model or a sin tax to generate revenue would not be workable in Milwaukee County." Our rating Barrett said that using a surcharge on the cigarette tax to help pay for a new downtown sports arena "is not feasible under state law." A spokeswoman said meant that the tax wasn’t allowed under state law as it presently exists. But that doesn’t mean that state law can’t be changed. Indeed, state approval is likely going to be needed for any mix of higher taxes that could be used to fund an arena expansion or renovation. In that respect, there is nothing different about the approval required for a cigarette tax increase, a funding option that’s used in other parts of the country. Our definition for Half True is a statement that's partially accurate but leaves out important details. That fits here. Note: An earlier version of this item incorrectly stated that the Public Policy Forum was leading a task force studying the area's cultural needs. The organization is only conducting research into the matter.	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2014-03-13T05:00:00	2014-03-03	['None']
pomt-05321	Says Gov. Scott Walker said "no to equal pay for equal work for women."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/17/tom-barrett/wisconsin-recall-challenger-tom-barrett-says-gov-s/	We’ve rated statements by three Wisconsin politicians about a law that eliminated the right of discriminated workers to sue in state court -- and none of the three earned better than a Mostly False. Will Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett be added to the list? Barrett, the Democratic challenger to Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the June 5, 2012 recall election, made his claim in a TV ad released May 10, 2012. In the ad, which makes several attacks on Walker, the narrator claims that Walker says "no to equal pay for equal work for women." On the screen are male and female stick figures; an equals sign with a slash through it sits between them. The words "Associated Press, 4/7/2012" also appear, indicating the ad’s source is a news article. The phrasing and the imagery in the ad suggest Walker opposes equal pay for women who are doing the same jobs as men. Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told us the ad refers to an AP article in the Wisconsin State Journal about several bills signed two days earlier by Walker that Democrats say amounts to a Walker "war on women." The new law repealed a change -- passed in June 2009 when Democrats controlled state government -- that allowed workers to pursue discrimination claims against their employers in state court. Walzak argued that Walker was saying no to equal pay for women because the new law affects women who suffer workplace discrimination, and that Walker did so "at the highest level" that a governor can, by signing a law. He also argued that the old law, by allowing state court suits, deterred employers from discriminating and penalized those that did. The state’s anti-discrimination workplace law, he said, "is only as good as its enforcement." Some employee attorneys contend the new law is a blow to equal pay because it takes away the option of a state lawsuit, which they say is easier and less expensive than one filed in federal court. Moreover, most but not all workplace discrimination claims can be filed in federal court. In the nearly three years the old law was in effect, however, no state lawsuits were filed. We cited that when we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that the law was a "gravy train" for lawyers. We also pointed out -- in rating False a claim by former Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk that women "can’t do something" about pay discrimination -- that a federal suit for damages is an option for most discriminated workers; and that all workers claiming discrimination can seek "make whole" remedies, such as back pay, through a state or federal agency. And we rated Mostly False a statement by state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, that the old law ensured women would not be paid less than men. Now it’s Barrett’s turn. Our rating Barrett said Walker says "no to equal pay for equal work for women," suggesting Walker doesn’t want women to be paid the same as men for doing the same job, or that he has taken steps to ensure unequal pay. Walker signed a law that removes one of the legal avenues women had to fight discrimination in pay. But such discrimination remains illegal and women who believe they are paid less because of their gender still have three options for pursuing their claims. We rate Barrett’s claim False.

pomt-00844	State lawmakers are spending taxpayer money for parking that billionaire Arthur Blank could build while paying some state employees so little they are on food stamps.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/23/tyrone-brooks/brooks-lacks-data-back-food-stamp-claim/	Georgia taxpayers are already on the hook for $17 million for parking improvements for the new Atlanta Falcons stadium, and that cost is expected to grow to $30 million with passage of this year’s state budget. But not everyone agrees that parking for Falcons fans should be a state budget priority when Arthur Blank, the billionaire owner of the Falcons, could pay for the improvements himself. "Our priorities are so mixed up," veteran state Rep. Tyrone Brooks, D-Atlanta, said in an interview Jan. 20. "We have state employees on food stamps who have to work two or three jobs to make ends meet." Could Brooks be right? Is the state paying millions for parking while some employees earn so little that they qualify for food stamps? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. But first a little background about the parking. Officials had long promised that the state wouldn’t have to chip in for the $1.4 billion stadium, which will be adjacent to the Georgia World Congress Center. Then suddenly last year there was a push for $17 million for the first phase of a plan to add 1,000 parking spaces, helping to offset 1,300 lost in the football stadium’s construction. World Congress Center officials didn’t formally ask for the money until the final days of the legislative session, so it saw virtually no debate among lawmakers. Most didn’t find out about it until after the final budget deal had already been struck. Gov. Nathan Deal said he was only swayed to support the project by a broader argument that it also could be used for conventions, the College Football Hall of Fame and a hotel that is envisioned for the site. This year, World Congress Center officials were more open about a request for an additional $23 million to complete the parking deck, which they aggressively cast as an economic development tool and the first phase of a broader vision for the complex. The House and Senate have signed off on budget proposals that include the $23 million, although a conference committee report settling differences in their two versions of the budget still has to be negotiated, approved and signed by the governor. But what about Brooks’ claim? As we do with all fact checks, we contacted Brooks and asked for his evidence. When we first reached out to him, he was traveling. But Brooks told us there was a report that backed up his statement. He gave us the name of one legislative colleague and two private organizations, one or more of which he said could provide us with the report. We reached out to all three, but we found no such report. We circled back to Brooks, but he did not offer any information to support his claim. The state doesn’t keep data that we could find on how many of its workers are on food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. SNAP is available to people in Georgia with a gross household income that does not exceed 130 percent of the federal poverty level, $1,265 a month ($15,180 a year) for one person and $2,584 a month ($31,008 a year) for a family of four. Given those thresholds, it’s more than plausible that there are state workers who are teetering near that line and could obtain food stamps. The left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute identified one of the cleanest examples last year in a report headlined "Teaching pre-k children shouldn’t require a vow of poverty." The report pointed out that a pre-k assistant teacher makes $13,300 a year. We found other examples, including at the state Department of Corrections and even in the food stamp program itself, where an entry-level case worker makes $24,322. "Given many of our employees are single parents earning entry-level salaries, there's no question we have a percentage of staff who turn to SNAP benefits to support their family" said Susan Boatwright, spokeswoman for the state Division of Family and Children Services. Last year, a state audit showed the starting pay for a state corrections officer was $24,322, lower than in any bordering state except South Carolina. Based on SNAP criteria, an assistant pre-k teacher who is single could qualify for food stamps and so could a starting corrections officer who is married and the sole support for a wife and two children. With more than 100,000 people in the state government’s employment, there’s likely no doubt at least some would be part of the 840,815 households -- including about 92,000 in Fulton County and 72,000 in DeKalb County -- that received food stamps in the fiscal year that ended June 30. Our conclusion: It’s legitimate to question the use of taxpayer money for a project driven largely by a push for a new football stadium. And that debate will likely continue. But Brooks questioned whether a parking deck should be a state priority when there are state employees on food stamps and working two jobs. We found anecdotal evidence to suggest he could be right. But he did not produce evidence to back up his claim. Therefore, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Tyrone Brooks	None	None	None	2015-03-23T00:00:00	2015-01-20	['Arthur_Blank']
pomt-14267	"Because of (the 1994 crime bill), we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this, because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/08/bill-clinton/fact-checking-bill-clintons-philly-defense-his-con/	Bill Clinton’s now-controversial 1994 crime bill was at the center of a clash Thursday between the former president and protesters in Philadelphia in which Clinton defended the bill, saying it was the reason behind huge drops in crime rates by the end of his presidency. "Because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this," Clinton responded Thursday, "because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence. And how do you think those lives were, that mattered? Whose lives were saved, that mattered?" But can the decreases in crime since the late 1980s really be attributed to Clinton’s signature legislation? Here’s what we found. During Bill Clinton’s campaign stop for his wife in Philadelphia on April 7, a protester with the Philadelphia Coalition for Real Justice yelled questions at the former president while another held a sign that read "Clinton crime bill destroyed our community." The protester, later identified as Erica Mines, criticized the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act that provided for higher federal funding for prison facilities that some say ushered in mass incarceration in America. The former president continued defending the bill, asking the protesters whether they were really defending criminals. "I don’t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out into the street to murder other African American children," he told the protesters. "Maybe you thought they were good citizens — [Hillary Clinton] didn’t." At a campaign stop the next day in Erie, Pa., Bill Clinton issued an apology of sorts, saying he "rather vigorously defended" his wife. "I did something yesterday in Philadelphia," he said, according to MSNBC. "I almost want to apologize for it, but I want to use it as an example of the danger threatening our country." In addition to prison funding, the crime bill also expanded the use of the death penalty, provided states with incentives to implement harsher sentences on criminals and established the Community Oriented Policing Services program, which provided grants to fund up to 75 percent of new police hires for three years. As Bill Clinton said, the crime rate at the end of his presidency was the lowest in two decades and statistics published in a 2000 report on homicide trends from the Bureau of Justice Statistics show the murder rate had "declined to levels last seen in the late 1960s." But experts say the decline in crime during Clinton’s time in the White House can’t all be attributed to the 1994 crime bill. Crime rates nationally began to drop just before the passage of the crime bill, in 1992. Multiple academic reports on the topic begin with 1991 to trace when recorded incidents began to slip. There are several factors, researchers find, that could have caused this fall in crime. In fact, researchers don’t entirely agree on which factors had the greatest impact. Our analysis can find this consensus: the drop cannot be solely attributed to the crime bill, and the size of the crime bill’s contribution, while arguable, may not be higher than a third, according to more favorable analyses, if not marginal overall, per more conservative accounts. For starters, here are some other debated but commonly acknowledged factors. Through 1991 to 1993, the ‘90s boom began, creating more job opportunities in the low-wage sector. The impact of the the crack epidemic entering its death knell has also been cited. The crime bill created 100,000 new jobs for cops, but the number of police officers in the U.S. rose by 50,000 to 60,000 per capita over the decade, a 14 percent increase. By the end of Clinton’s time in the White House, the number of incarcerated Americans rose by nearly 60 percent, according to figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. A 2015 study by NYU’s Brennan Center for Justice found that "increased incarceration at today’s levels has a negligible crime control benefit." According to the researchers, increased incarceration accounted for about 6 percent of the drop in property crime in the 1990s and had little impact on nationwide decreases in violent crime. Inimai Chettiar, the director of the Brennan Center’s Justice Program, said the crime bill’s investment in local police forces did contribute to a decrease in crime rates, but mass incarceration played a smaller role in driving decreases in crime. She suggested the the drops could also be attributed to improved technology in policing techniques and changes in social and economic factors like an aging population and a decrease in alcohol consumption. Other studies also suggest mass incarceration leads to "diminishing returns," meaning the practice may have had a larger impact on decreasing crime rates when it was first implemented, but those results slowly decrease over time. A 2014 study from the Hamilton Project, an offshoot of the Brookings Institution, called mass incarceration and crime control "a classic case of diminishing marginal returns." Marc Lamont Hill, a political commentator and professor of African American studies at Morehouse College, told CNN Thursday "there's absolutely no empirical evidence to suggest that crime bill was the causal factor that made crime go down." "You can cherry pick anecdotes, a bunch of anecdotes together and it doesn't make it data," Hill said. "The data does not bear out." Hillary Clinton has somewhat separated herself from her husband’s legislation. "It's time to change our approach," she said during a talk on criminal justice last year. "It's time to end the era of mass incarceration. We need a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe." Bill Clinton’s defense of the crime bill comes less than a year after he appeared at a national convention for the NAACP when he issued a mea culpa of sorts over his own bill. "I signed a bill that made the problem worse," he said in July 2015 in Philadelphia. "And I want to admit that." Our ruling In a heated exchange with protesters in Philadelphia, Bill Clinton defended his 1994 crime bill saying "because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and listen to this, because of that and the background check law, a 46-year low in the deaths of people of gun violence." Experts and studies haven’t reached consensus on what caused the historic drops in crime. But they do roundly agree that it can’t all be attributed to Clinton’s 1994 crime bill. In fact, most suggest the crime bill’s role in the drop was negligible. We rule the claim Mostly False.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-08T14:38:19	2016-04-07	['None']
pomt-13310	"Kelly Ayotte voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/oct/07/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/ad-claims-kelly-ayotte-voted-billion-dollar-tax-br/	As the U.S. Senate race heats up, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee took out an ad bashing Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte’s record on climate. The 30-second spot takes aim at Ayotte’s ties to "big oil." "Kelly Ayotte voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks, and they gave her campaign contributions," the narrator says. PolitiFact decided to see if there was any truth to the claim. Let’s look at Ayotte’s votes first. Politifact has looked at similar claims, like when the Senate Majority PAC said former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown "voted to give oil companies big tax breaks." PolitiFact found that claim Mostly True. In this fact-check, we’ll focus on Ayotte’s votes. We’ll tackle campaign contributions separately. The DSCC pointed us to Ayotte’s votes in 2011 and 2012 against measures that would have stripped existing tax breaks from the "big five" oil companies: Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips. The 2011 Democratic-backed proposal would have eliminated five tax breaks for the companies and generated an estimated $21 billion over a decade, according to the New York Times. The bill that came a year later would have eliminated $24 billion in tax subsidies from the five oil companies, according to the Boston Globe. Specifically, the measures would have kept those five multinational oil companies from using these existing tax breaks: • Deductions on taxes paid to foreign governments • Deductions on domestic manufacturing costs • Deductions for intangible drilling costs • Percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells • Deductions for qualified tertiary injectant expenses Three of these breaks applied specifically to the oil industry. The other two -- the ones about manufacturing costs and taxes paid to foreign governments -- can be claimed by businesses other than oil companies. If passed, these five provisions would still have applied to companies beyond the "big five" oil firms. In each of the two years, the proposal failed to advance in the U.S. Senate by margins of 52-48 in 2011 and 51-47 in 2012. The bills needed 60 votes in order to cut off debate and take a final vote. Ayotte joined most Republicans and a handful of Democrats from oil states to oppose the measure both times it hit the Senate floor. The bill’s opponents sometimes cited a March 2012 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that concluded withholding subsidies from companies could increase prices at the pump. In general the ad is correct that Ayotte sided with the position of "big oil" when she voted against advancing the bills. But the ad’s wording is misleading. It states Ayotte "voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks." Ayotte really voted against stripping the companies of tax breaks they already enjoyed. Meanwhile, Ayotte’s campaign pointed to several votes she has taken opposing tax credits for the oil and gas industry. One amendment, to a highway bill, would have repealed more than a dozen various tax credits including those for alternative fuel mixtures, certain plug-in vehicles, biodiesel and renewable diesel used as fuel and electricity produced from certain renewable resources. The amendment did not propose to repeal any of the tax breaks for the "big five" oil companies mentioned above, but it did target two credits dealing with oil -- one for producing oil and gas from marginal wells, and another for enhanced oil recovery. Neither was in effect when the amendment was offered and the marginal well credit hasn’t been used since its creation in 2004, according to a 2013 article from lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Ayotte was one of 26 senators who voted for the amendment. It was opposed by a bipartisan group of 76 senators, including Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. Ayotte’s campaign also pointed to a February amendment that would have phased out tax credits for fossil fuels on the same schedule as those for wind farms. The proposal, offered by Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, targeted many of the same existing tax breaks for "big oil" as the bills from 2011 and 2012. For example, it would have phased out deductions for intangible drilling costs and deductions on domestic manufacturing costs, among others. Ayotte joined most Democrats to vote for the amendment, which was defeated 50 to 45. Our Ruling The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Kelly Ayotte "voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks." In 2011 and 2012, Ayotte did indeed vote against measures that would have barred the biggest five oil companies from taking advantage of tax breaks they already enjoyed, which added up to more than $20 billion. But that’s slightly different than what the ad says. Rather than vote to give the companies a new break, as the ad implies, Ayotte voted to support the status quo. Ayotte’s record is more complex, however, and she cast more recent votes that would have repealed some tax breaks for big oil. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.	None	Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2016-10-07T11:45:49	2016-09-06	['None']
pomt-10209	Obama's one education accomplishment was "legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/11/john-mccain/an-absurd-claim-about-a-bill-that-never-passed/	(Published Sept. 11, 2008) John McCain released an ad this week making the accusation that Barack Obama supports sex education for five-year-olds. Here's what the ad says: " Education Week says Obama 'hasn't made a significant mark on education,' that he's 'elusive' on accountability, a 'staunch defender of the existing public school monopoly.' "Obama's one accomplishment? Legislation to teach 'comprehensive sex education' to kindergartners. "Learning about sex before learning to read? Barack Obama. Wrong on education. Wrong for your family." Here, we'll check the claim that Obama wants five-year-olds to learn about sex. We've checked what Education Week said in a separate item and found it Barely True . The origins of this claim go back to Obama's days as a state senator in the Illinois General Assembly. In 2003, the Assembly considered a bill to expand sex education directives from grades 6 through 12 to grades K through 12. The legislation required the curriculum to be medically accurate and include information on the prevention of HIV and contraceptives. It also said abstinence must be taught and that students "shall be encouraged to base their actions on reasoning, self-discipline, sense of responsibility, self-control, and ethical considerations, such as respect for oneself and others." Most pertinent to the kindergarten allegation, the legislation states that "course material and instruction shall be age and developmentally appropriate." Carol Ronen, the now-retired state senator who sponsored the bill, said its main intent was to make sure that teenagers got information that was "medically accurate," a requirement that wasn't then part of the school code. A secondary effect was to expand age-appropriate sex education down to lower grades, to allow things like teaching school children to avoid sex predators, Ronen said. "Barack never had anything to do with it," she said. "This is a lot of hoopla." Obama voted for the legislation in committee on a party-line vote. He was not a sponsor nor a co-sponsor, and the legislation never made it to a full Senate vote. So calling it one of his accomplishments is wrong, since it never became law and it wasn't his bill anyway. This isn't the first time Obama has faced the "sex ed for kindergartners" charge. When Obama ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004, his opponent Alan Keyes used it. "Nobody's suggesting that kindergartners are going to be getting information about sex in the way that we think about it," Obama said at a campaign event in 2004. "If they ask a teacher 'where do babies come from,' that providing information that the fact is that it's not a stork is probably not an unhealthy thing. Although again, that's going to be determined on a case-by-case basis by local communities and local school boards." Obama said that he did not support telling youngsters about explicit information about sex. The bill specifically mentions that instructional material must be age appropriate. It specifically mentions teaching children how to "say no to unwanted sexual advances" and "nonconsensual physical sexual contact." The legislation was not sponsored by Obama and it didn't pass, so calling it one of his "accomplishments" is absurd. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-10210	Says Obama called Sarah Palin a pig.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/10/john-mccain/if-theres-lipstick-on-a-pig-its-this-mccain-ad/	(Published Sept. 10, 2008) The story begins, like so many these days, with Gov. Sarah Palin’s speech at the Republican National Convention last week. Having stirred the crowd to its feet more than once, Palin delivered a knockout line when she deadpanned: “I love those hockey moms. You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.” The line drew cheerful applause and has echoed ever since, which seems to explain how Sen. Barack Obama found himself in the middle of an uproar when he uttered a time-worn phrase to denigrate Sen. John McCain’s proclaimed agenda for “change” in Washington. "John McCain says he's about change, too," Obama said. "And so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out, George Bush! Except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy, and Karl Rove-style politics, we're really going to shake things up in Washington.'" "That's not change," Obama said. "That's just calling something the same thing something different. But you know, you can put lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. You can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it’s still going to stink after eight years. We’ve had enough of the same old thing." Gasp! He just said lipstick! Did he just call Sarah Palin a pig??!!! That’s the charge. Later that day, the McCain campaign arranged a conference call for reporters with Jane Swift, the former governor of Massachusetts. She said that when you add up Obama’s comments and Palin’s comments, you get Obama calling Palin a pig. Swift said Obama should apologize. “Calling a very prominent female governor of one of our states a ‘pig’ is not exactly what we want to see,” Swift said. The issue has dominated the presidential campaign for two days, with the McCain campaign stirring a controversy by having local lawmakers call for Obama to apologize, and the Obama campaign responding with examples of how often he and others have used the phrase. The next day, Obama called the McCain’s campaign tactics “lies and phony outrage and Swift-boat politics.” On Wednesday, the McCain campaign released a Web ad called “Lipstick.” It begins with a clip of Palin delivering her lipstick line, then text flashes on the screen saying “Barack Obama on: Sarah Palin.” A moment later, the ad plays a small portion of Obama’s “lipstick on a pig” remark, but not enough of his quotation to make clear what he was talking about. The ad concludes with a clip of CBS anchor Katie Couric soberly remarking on sexism on the campaign trail. The ad has two big problems, as does the complaint of former Gov. Swift. First, in the full text of the remarks it’s clear that Obama isn’t talking about Sarah Palin. He’s talking about McCain’s argument that he represents change. Second, “putting lipstick on a pig” is a popular put-down, especially among politicians. It generally means taking a bad or unattractive idea and trying to dress it up. We weren’t able to pin down the origins of this folksy expression, but we found tons of instances of people using it. The political newspaper The Hill labeled the phrase “Congress Speak” back in June, and gave it an official definition: “an expression used to illustrate that something unattractive cannot be beautified or otherwise positively changed by any amount of makeup or other exterior alterations.” In 1986, Texas Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower used the phrase to criticize Ronald Reagan’s farm policy. During the 2004 presidential campaign, both Dick Cheney and John Edwards used it to attack the other guy’s running mate. Earlier this year, Democratic Congresswoman Linda Sanchez of California gave a speech on trade policy. “You know the old saying about putting lipstick on a pig? Well, I smell bacon,” she groused. Obama and McCain both have used the expression. In September 2007, Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson quoted Obama using the phrase to discuss Iraq policy: “I think that both Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,” Obama said. “George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.” In Iowa on Oct. 11, 2007, McCain panned Sen. Hillary Clinton’s health care plan, calling it “eerily reminiscent” of the plan that failed during Bill Clinton’s administration, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune. “I think they put some lipstick on a pig,” McCain said, “but it’s still a pig.” On Feb. 1, 2007, McCain blasted a Senate resolution that would have criticized President Bush’s strategy in Iraq. Some had praised the resolution as a compromise measure, but McCain disagreed. “It gets down to whether you support what is being done in this new strategy or you don’t,” McCain said. “You can put lipstick on a pig, [but] it’s still a pig, in my view.” It is simply impossible to view the complete remarks by Obama and conclude that he’s making a veiled and unsavory reference to Palin. Her name never is used in the preceding sentence. In fact, it’s hard to see how one could interpret Obama’s lipstick-on-a-pig remark as referring directly to McCain, either. We think it’s very clear that Obama was saying McCain’s effort to call himself the “candidate of change” is like putting lipstick on a pig, trying to dress up a bad idea to look better. Agree or disagree with Obama’s point, but his remark wasn’t the smear that McCain’s people have tried to make it. If anyone’s doing any smearing, it’s the McCain campaign and its outrageous attempt to distort the facts. Did Obama call Palin a pig? No, and saying so is Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-11358	"It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process."	false	/florida/statements/2018/apr/04/free-thought-project/did-florida-police-seize-mans-gun-out-due-process-/	After the Parkland school shooting, Florida lawmakers passed a so-called "red flag" law that aims to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed to be a threat to others or themselves. The new law went into effect March 9, quickly stoking concern among people about lost freedom. A March 18 headline posted on the Free Thought Project said, "It begins: Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process." The post went on to say a man in Lighthouse Point — in Broward County, like Parkland — had his guns taken away before he was determined to be mentally unfit and before he was accused of a crime, making him the first person in the state to "have his due process removed." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The post makes it seem like a man’s guns were taken without reason or cause, but that leaves out important nuance about the situation. Authorities said the man voluntarily surrendered his weapons and never contested the temporary risk protection order barring him from his guns for up to a year. Florida’s "risk protection law" Florida legislators moved quickly to pass SB 7026, allowing law enforcement to seek a risk protection order from a judge that would temporarily remove a person’s firearm(s) for up to a year. It also bars those individuals from buying guns during that time. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri took issue with the way the law has been portrayed in headlines. He said if a person doesn’t comply with a risk protection order, then police have to file a warrant and establish probable cause to obtain the weapon. "There is no seizure authority," Gualtieri said. "You can ask them to comply with the risk protection order, but you can’t seize a person’s guns." The law slightly amended the Baker Act, under which law enforcement officials can take someone against their will to a facility for a mental health evaluation if the person is a danger to themselves or others. Authorities can confiscate a person’s guns if they pose a potential danger to themselves or have made a credible threat of violence against another person. Before this change, the Baker Act didn’t state whether guns should be taken or returned, except to ban guns from hospitals providing mental health services. In practice, officers would often — but not always — temporarily confiscate guns if the firearms were on the person or in plain sight during the Baker Act "episode," said Martha Lenderman, an expert on the Baker Act. More states added similar "red flag" laws this year including Washington. Matt Agorist, who wrote the Free Thought Project article, argued that Florida’s new law allows law enforcement officers to retain guns without due process. "When a person is stripped of their constitutional rights, albeit temporarily, without being given the chance to make their own case based on what can be entirely arbitrary accusations, this is the removal of due process," Agorist said in an email to PolitiFact Florida. However, this neglects the fact that the person in question allowed police to retain his guns at the time he was taken into custody under the Baker Act. After this, Lighthouse Point police took the necessary steps to obtain a temporary risk protection order, which a judge reviewed and signed. Details about the Florida police seizing a man’s handgun PolitiFact Florida interviewed Lighthouse Point Police Chief Ross Licata and Broward County’s chief judge to get an understanding of the incident that led to a 56-year-old man losing his weapons. Licata said officers have had interactions with the man for years, but it wasn’t until early March that his actions warranted action. (PolitiFact Florida is not naming the man because of his condition.) On March 7, Lighthouse Point Police checked on the man at his condo after an anonymous person filed a complaint that he was acting strangely. According to court records, the person said the man had been seen around the community "clutching his face and hair while arguing with himself." The complainant also said the man had admitted to turning off the main electrical breakers to the condo building "to prevent them from sending electrical impulses through his body and controlling him." Licata said that this was causing a safety issue for other residents who depend on oxygen. During the police welfare check, the man said he was being targeted by one of his neighbors, who he said shape-shifts and looks like Osama bin Laden. The man was carrying a firearm in the outer pocket of his cargo pants, according to court records. The man voluntarily surrendered his weapons during the welfare check, said Broward’s chief administrative judge, Circuit Judge Jack Tuter. After that, police determined the man was a risk to himself and others and took him into custody under the Baker Act. Licata said the subject was not released from the medical center until March 21. Before he was released, police petitioned the court to get a temporary ex parte order and a permanent risk protection order March 14 to retain the man’s guns. (An ex parte orders allows the court to proceed temporarily without both parties present for a hearing. In this case, the man was still being held at a medical facility.) Law enforcement met with the man at his condo March 21 to remove additional ammunition. One week after his release, there was a final hearing to determine if the guns and ammunition should be removed for one year. The man was there. He did not contest the one-year risk protection order requested by police. Tuter signed the order preventing him from owning or purchasing guns. Our ruling A headline on the Free Thought Project said, "Florida police now confiscating guns from people with no due process." The headline and the story make it appear that Florida police arbitrarily took away a man’s guns, and that’s not the case. The man in question voluntarily gave his weapons to police before he was taken into custody under the Baker Act, a judge said. While the man was being treated, Lighthouse Point police followed the protocol for obtaining a temporary risk protection order, and the man did not contest the order at any point during the court proceedings.

pomt-12503	Treasury Department's inspector general found "there's $4 billion a year in excess payments" going to people that shouldn’t get them. "These are mostly Mexicans."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/27/jeff-sessions/sessions-says-4-billion-tax-credits-go-mostly-mexi/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions is optimistic that funds for President Donald Trump’s border wall will come through. One way could be with savings from money that’s inappropriately going to immigrants, he said. Sessions talked about paying for the wall on ABC’s This Week after host George Stephanopoulos asked if Mexico would pay for the wall, as Trump has promised. "Well, we're going to get paid for it one way or the other. I know there's $4 billion a year in excess payments, according to the Department of the Treasury's own inspector general several years ago, that are going to payments to people -- tax credits that they shouldn't get," Sessions said April 23. "These are mostly Mexicans. And those kind of things add up -- $4 billion a year for 10 years is $40 billion. There are a lot of ways we can find money to help pay for this." Sessions left us wondering if $4 billion a year in tax credits are going to people who are not supposed to get them, and if they are mostly Mexicans. There’s some truth to Sessions’ claim, but it also leaves out some critical details. Treasury Department report Anyone who earns an income in the United States is required to pay taxes, whether they live here legally or illegally. Generally, people who are authorized to work in the United States use a Social Security Number to report income and pay taxes on them. Individuals who don’t have employment authorization can file their taxes using a nine-digit Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). Experts say the majority of ITIN filers likely are individuals who are living in the country illegally, but an ITIN can also be issued to people here legally, such as foreign workers. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration issued an audit in 2011 that said $4.2 billion in refundable credits were paid to individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States. These funds were claimed in the 2010 tax processing year by a total 2.3 million ITIN filers. $4.2 billion tax credits The Treasury audit focused on refunds through the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), available to individuals who owed less in taxes than deductions for the Child Tax Credit (up to $1,000 per child). A child must be a U.S. citizen or resident in order for a parent to claim the credit. A law passed in 1996 denied another credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), to individuals who file taxes without a Social Security Number that authorizes employment. ITIN filers are also not eligible for Social Security benefits. But as we’ve reported in a similar claim, Congress has not written a provision barring ITIN filers from claiming the ACTC. The audit cited by Sessions said "clarification to the law is needed to address whether or not refundable tax credits such as the ACTC may be paid to those who are not authorized to work in the United States." In response to a draft of the audit, the Internal Revenue Service said: "The law does not require the taxpayer or eligible child to have a Social Security number in order to receive the (Child Tax Credit) or the ACTC. The IRS is administering the law accordingly. Legislative changes would be required to deny many of the claims discussed in the report." Regarding the $4.2 billion for processing year 2010, a Congressional Research Service report in 2016 noted that the figure did not necessarily represent the annual revenue losses, since about 11 percent of claimants in 2010 filed tax returns for multiple years. The audit said the returns filed for multiple years resulted in claims of more than $1 billion, but not all claims were refunded due to statute of limitations. Point being, the report doesn't show the availability of $4 billion a year, as Sessions said. And while parents may not be working legally in the United States, in some cases their children are U.S. citizens. "Under what Mr. Sessions is suggesting, it wouldn’t be Mexico that pays for the border wall, but rather low-income children — most of them U.S. citizens and part of the future U.S. workforce — and their families," said Bob Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ‘Mostly Mexicans’? The 2011 audit did not list nationalities of ITIN filers claiming the credit. Sessions’ office referred us to a Department of Homeland Security report on the estimates of the unauthorized population as of January 2012, around the time of the audit’s analysis. The DHS report said that of the estimated 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants, 6.7 million were from Mexico. While the majority of ITIN filers are likely illegally in the country, Greenstein told us there is no data to precisely determine how many Mexican ITIN filers are claiming the ACTC. Though a report from the IRS’ Taxpayer Advocate office found that about half of people applying for ITINs in 2014 were Mexican. That report also found that in 2015, 4.4 million ITIN filers paid more than $5.5 billion in payroll and Medicare taxes and $23.6 billion in total taxes. Our ruling Sessions said, the Treasury Department's inspector general found "there's $4 billion a year in excess payments" going to people that shouldn’t get them. "These are mostly Mexicans." An audit did find $4.2 billion in refundable credits for child care were paid to individuals who are not authorized to work in the United States. Those $4.2 billion were claimed in tax processing year 2010, but about 11 percent of claimants in 2010 filed tax returns for multiple years, meaning that amount wouldn't necessarily be available annually. Sessions says these people "shouldn’t" get the tax credit. That may be his opinion, but there’s nothing in the law now saying they can’t claim the credits. The audit didn’t have anything to say about the nationality of those who claimed the credits, though other evidence suggests it’s likely that about half could be Mexican. Sessions’ statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-00909	"I never said I was on the Falkland Islands."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/03/bill-oreilly/oreilly-i-never-said-i-was-falkland-islands/	Bill O’Reilly’s accounts of his early years as a reporter have garnered a lot of attention lately, especially his experiences in the 1980s during the Falklands War. For those who might not remember, a full-blown battle broke out in 1982 when Argentina sought to claim the islands that had long been held by the United Kingdom. The scrutiny of the iconic Fox News host began with a Mother Jones article by David Corn and Daniel Schulman. It asserted, "For years, O'Reilly has recounted dramatic stories about his own war reporting that don't withstand scrutiny — even claiming he acted heroically in a war zone that he apparently never set foot in." O’Reilly has aggressively defended his reputation. "David Corn, a liar, says that I exaggerated situations in the Falklands War and Salvadoran War," O’Reilly said on his Feb. 20, 2015, show. "I never said I was on the Falkland Islands, as Corn purports. I said I covered the Falklands War, which I did." The full scope of the dispute over O’Reilly’s past actions is larger than a single fact-check, but here we will attempt to address O’Reilly’s statement that "I never said I was on the Falklands Islands." The Falklands War -- a primer The Falkland Islands lie about 400 miles off the southern coast of Argentina. There are two main islands and hundreds of smaller ones. Today, there about 3,000 residents and around half a million sheep. Britain claimed the islands in 1765. By the 1960s, Argentina was pushing hard to assert its own rights to the territory, which it called the Malvinas. The argument simmered until April 1982 when Argentine troops landed on the islands. Britain sent 100 war ships, fighter jets and infantry to repulse them. Britain sank an Argentine cruiser. Argentina bombed British landing craft. The fighting lasted about two and a half months until Argentina surrendered. By that point, it had lost about 650 men; about 250 British soldiers had died. During all this time, no American journalists were on the ground on the islands themselves. Most of the coverage originated from Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, over 1,000 miles from the fighting. When the British forces won, huge riots broke out around the presidential palace. Thousands took to the streets in frustration over the lost war. There was violence, tear gas, rock-throwing and rubber bullets fired. There were injuries and property damage, but to the best of anyone’s knowledge, no one died. Bill O’Reilly -- a primer Everyone knows O’Reilly as the brash, "no-spin zone" Fox News host, but before taking up with Fox in 1996, O’Reilly had spent many years working his way up through network television. He had reporting jobs in cities including Dallas, Denver and Portland, Ore. His big break came in 1982 when he became a correspondent for CBS News. While at CBS, he was sent to Buenos Aires to cover the Falklands War. It was there that he saw the riots that he has referred to as a war zone. In fact, O’Reilly felt CBS never gave him the credit he deserved for the reporting he did when the rioting was most intense. O’Reilly moved to ABC News in 1986, and then left to become the host of a news and entertainment show called Inside Edition. He stayed in that slot until 1995 when he went to Harvard’s Kennedy School to get a degree in public policy. The Fox News network was just getting started when O’Reilly graduated and he became host of the show that soon became known as The O’Reilly Factor. O’Reilly and the Falklands O’Reilly’s accounts of his time in Argentina go into most detail when he describes helping a cameraman who was knocked down and cut his ear, and about soldiers firing on protesters. The rest of the time, his references to the war have been more in passing. The Mother Jones article included several instances when O’Reilly talked or wrote about the Falklands. For example, it cited a line from O’Reilly’s book The No Spin Zone: Confrontations With the Powerful and Famous in America, that said, "I've reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands." There are also two video clips of O’Reilly referring to his Falklands experiences. In one, O’Reilly chides journalist Bill Moyers, saying, "I missed Moyers in the war zones of the Falkland conflict in Argentina, the Middle East and Northern Ireland. I looked for Bill, but I didn't see him." Our search of the Nexis database unearthed an instance on Feb. 13, 2007, when O’Reilly talked on his show about the Falklands. He was interviewing two reporters who had covered the Iraq War. One of them, Mark Kukis with Time magazine, described what it was like to interview soldiers. Kukis: "The soldiers that I was in combat with in those moments, they get really psyched up and they're excited, particularly the Marines in Ramadi. It's not a bad time to talk to them about what they're doing. It's probably the best time if you want to get a positive response from them." O'Reilly: "Okay. See, my experience in El Salvador, in the Falklands War was let them calm down. Because ... when all hell breaks loose, you know, you're not thinking clearly. You're reacting." While there’s some wiggle room for interpretation, a reasonable person would think that O’Reilly had been with soldiers in combat in the Falklands. In another video clip used by Mother Jones, O’Reilly was a little more ambiguous. "I was in a situation one time, in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands, where my photographer got run down and then hit his head and was bleeding from the ear on the concrete." Interpreting O’Reilly’s statements Ultimately, this fact-check is an exercise in the art of language. Namely, did O’Reilly never say he was on the Falklands islands? Two media critics, one from Fox News and one from Politico said this is a dispute over semantics. Fox News said in a statement that "This is nothing more than an orchestrated campaign by far left advocates Mother Jones and Media Matters." Lawyers and logicians remind us that it’s impossible to prove the negative, but the evidence we’ve seen shows that O’Reilly used the preposition "in" to describe his Falklands experience. He said "in the war zones of the Falkland conflict in Argentina." And he said "in a war zone in Argentina, in the Falklands." Under some circumstances, "in" can mean "during," as in "What did you do in the war, Daddy?" Daddy might have slogged through the swamps of Vietnam or he might have worked a desk in a Pentagon office. On the other hand, it’s not much of a stretch for a listener to conclude that O’Reilly’s statements meant that he had been on the same ground where the actual fighting took place. Certainly during his interview with war reporters, O’Reilly strongly implied that he had been with soldiers in combat "in the Falklands War." Even experienced listeners have stumbled over his meaning. Our ruling O’Reilly said, "I never said I was on the Falkland Islands." The central word here is "on." O’Reilly has a point that — at least so far as we can tell — he’s always said he was "in" the Falklands conflict rather than "on" the islands. At the very least, we can say that when O’Reilly talked about the Falklands in the past, his phrasing was ambiguous — to the extent that reasonable people could understand him to mean he’d set foot in a place where military combat was taking place, not reporting from 1,000 miles away. Also, O’Reilly offered his statement as proof that he never had falsely claimed that he was in the thick of the fighting. But you can suggest you were there without specifying that you were on the islands. The English language is plenty flexible enough to convey the same meaning using a different word, such as "in." O’Reilly’s statement is accurate but omits important context, so we rate this claim Half True. Correction: British forces sank an Argentine cruiser. An earlier version of this fact-check misidentified the type of vessel.	None	Bill O'Reilly	None	None	None	2015-03-03T11:15:51	2015-02-20	['None']
pomt-00684	"A sitting sheriff cannot be charged except by a warrant issued by a Superior Court judge."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/06/danny-porter/gwinnett-da-over-reaches-sheriff-hill-shooting-sta/	Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill made national headlines running for a second term while facing multiple felony charges such as racketeering and giving false statements. He said the charges were politically motivated, and he kept a relatively low profile after being acquitted on a whittled-down list of charges in 2013. But he was thrust back into the spotlight Sunday. Police said he telephoned 911 to report that he had shot a female acquaintance in a model home near Lawrenceville. Gwenevere McCord, 43, was rushed to the hospital in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. McCord’s family said she and Hill are longtime acquaintances. There was some confusion Sunday about whether police could arrest Hill if they felt charges were warranted. Georgia law says "a sitting sheriff cannot be charged except by a warrant issued by a Superior Court judge," Gwinnett District Attorney Danny Porter told AM750 and 95.5 FM News/Talk WSB, a news partner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, during an interview Monday morning. Porter later said that, after further research, he determined the state law only applies in cases where a sheriff is on official duty when he or she allegedly commits a crime. Hill was in Gwinnett on Sunday for what "appears to be a completely personal errand," Porter said. PolitiFact Georgia was intrigued. Does Georgia give special or different treatment to sheriffs who are suspected of a crime? We’ll look deeper at the law, which Terry Norris, the executive director of the Georgia Sheriffs’ Association, was quick to tell us applies to far more people than just sheriffs. It covers all peace officers, including sheriff’s deputies and police chiefs, as well as teachers and school administrators, Norris said. It states: "Any warrant for the arrest of a peace officer, law enforcement officer, teacher, or school administrator for any offense alleged to have been committed while in the performance of his or her duties may be issued only by a judge of a superior court, a judge of a state court, or a judge of a probate court." Norris said he believes the law, which we found dates to the 1860s, was designed to prevent private citizens from obtaining criminal warrants against sheriffs and teachers just because they were mad at them for doing their jobs. Magistrates and municipal judges can issue most warrants. But under these circumstances, the law requires requests for warrants be handled by higher-level probate, state or Superior Court judges, he said. Porter said Tuesday that he purposely proceeded cautiously. "I was not sure enough of the procedure that was required to arrest the sheriff. I was afraid I would make a procedural error in the case," he said. Porter said Gwinnett County has six state court judges and one probate judge, but he would have only considered going to one of the 10 Superior Court judges on Sunday night had he decided then to pursue a warrant against Hill. "I don’t have a relationship with them (the other judges)," Porter said, ‘that I could call them on a Sunday night and bring a police officer to their house." He said he also wasn’t certain whether Hill might claim to be on duty Sunday. "Police officers make the argument they’re always on duty,’ Porter said. "The sheriff is elected. I didn’t know if it made a difference. If he is arrested, he’ll probably make the argument that he was in performance of his duties." The Camaro that Hill was in had police lights and other equipment, Porter said. Professor Ronald Carlson at the University of Georgia School of Law said Porter’s actions made sense, given the statute. There are no Supreme Court rulings on the protections afforded law enforcement and other public officials in the code, Carlson said, leaving it to be followed as purely as possible. "With a high profile sort of case, and with a high-profile person who may be charged or not, it’s good to go to probably to the highest court listed in statute, and that’s the Superior Court judge," Carlson said. "I think he has the right idea.". Yet the question remained how Hill, as a sheriff, was allowed to leave the scene Sunday night. "How do you walk away from a shooting without saying anything? A lot of us in former law enforcement are scratching our heads," Former DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan told the AJC. "I don’t think you and I could have walked away from something like that." Jill Polster, an Atlanta criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor, said it is not unusual for police to not make an arrest until a thorough investigation is done when there is possibility of what attorneys call an "affirmative" defense. Those defenses pop up in situations such as the Hill shooting, or in home invasions, when the claim of accidental shootings or self-defense can delay or lengthen investigations as law enforcement conducts interviews to reconstruct what happened. For instance, former Peachtree City Police Chief William McCollom was indicted April 15 on reckless conduct charges from the New Year’s Day shooting that left his former wife paralyzed. McCollom told investigators he had fallen asleep with his gun in the bed when he accidentally shot Maggie McCollom in the back. In the Hill case, there is a living victim, too. Police are likely waiting to talk to her before moving too quickly to determine what happened in a case that includes at least two other eyewitnesses, Polster said. "In many stand-your-ground cases, or in the Peachtree City case, they take their time because there are a lot of possibilities to investigate," Polster said. Porter dismissed any suggestion that Hill’s position and reputation would likewise affect the outcome, saying, "Sometimes it’s better off to get it right than to get it fast." In fact, Polster said, Hill’s being sheriff may mean officers are more comfortable letting him leave a scene than they would someone who could fade away as they conducted their investigation. "Victor Hill is not going anywhere," Polster said. "He’s a public figure and he’s not going to flee, so they can take their time and complete a full investigation." Our conclusion: Gwinnett District Attorney Danny Porter said " A sitting sheriff cannot be charged except by a warrant issued by a Superior Court judge." He later said he had researched the law and determined that it only applied if the alleged crime occurred during the official performance of duty. Porter’s overarching point is that under Georgia law sheriffs are treated differently when they may have broken the laws they’re supposed to uphold. On that point, Porter is correct. But on the specifics, he’s off base. He had other options. Warrants can be issued against sheriffs by the state court and probate courts judges. PolitiFact defines a statement as Half True when it’s at least partially accurate but missing enough context to be misleading to the average reader. Porter’s statement fits that bill. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Danny Porter	None	None	None	2015-05-06T00:00:00	2015-05-04	['None']
pomt-04201	Public employees receive "something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/dec/06/mark-zaccaria/ri-gop-chairman-mark-zaccaria-says-public-employee/	Mark Zaccaria, the outgoing chairman of Rhode Island’s Republican Party, was on WJAR-Channel 10’s "News Conference" program recently, commenting on the hard time the state party had in legislative races this year. Though Republicans recently have had a strong record of success in winning the governor’s office -- the Democrats have held it for just 4 of the last 28 years -- the Grand Old Party took a beating in state House and Senate races in November, dropping from 18 Republicans out of a 113-member General Assembly in 2010 to 11 in the session that will begin in January. Zaccaria said the party’s poor showing was due in part to structural advantages he said the Rhode Island Democratic Party has developed over the years, particularly support from state and local government employees and their unions. "If you add the members of the teachers unions, if you add the other public service employees all around the state that are municipally based," he said, "it comes to something like 25 percent of the paychecks that are issued in Rhode Island." Now, we can’t determine whether drawing a state or local government paycheck guarantees how someone might vote. But we did wonder whether Zaccaria’s calculation was correct. When we asked him for his source, Zaccaria said he’d been using the 25-percent estimate since he ran for Congress in 2010. He said he’d done research to justify the figure, but after two years couldn’t recall the specific source of the statistic. So we went to the website of the Department of Labor and Training, which tracks the number of jobs in the state month by month and year by year. According to its October 2012 report, the most recent, Rhode Island had 463,300 non-farm jobs. The department breaks down those jobs into more than two dozen categories, including federal, state and local government workers. The local government category includes public school teachers. If you combine the local and state government numbers for October 2012, you get about 50,000 jobs, or about 11 percent of that 463,300 statewide job total -- less than half of Zaccaria’s estimate. Even if you add in the 10,000 federal government employees in the state, that would bring the number up to about 60,000, or about 13 percent of the state’s work force. Because Zaccaria said he’s been using his 25-percent figure since 2010, we went back to the 2010 numbers to see whether things were different then. They weren’t. The closest he would have come was January 2010, the month when the number of total jobs was lowest. Combined state and local government employees were counted at about 52,000 that month, 11.7 percent of that month’s 444,500 statewide jobs. Including 10,200 federal jobs that month would have bumped the public employee sector share to 14 percent, still short of 25 percent. Our ruling Rhode Island State Republican Chairman Mark Zaccaria said that 25 percent -- one in four -- of paychecks in the state of Rhode Island go to state workers, municipal workers and public school teachers. But state labor statistics show the figure is closer to 11 percent, or about 1 in 9. We rule his claim False.

pomt-04493	"Pre-existing conditions are covered under my (health care) plan."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-his-health-care-plan-covers-pre-e/	If there’s one thing people tell pollsters they like about "Obamacare," it’s the rule that says health insurance companies can no longer reject people for having pre-existing conditions. Republican nominee Mitt Romney said it’s an aspect of the health care law he wants to keep if elected president. "Pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan," Romney noted at the debate in Denver on Oct. 3. President Barack Obama challenged Romney on that point. "Well, actually, governor, that isn't what your plan does," Obama said. "What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if it's been under 90 days. But that's already the law, and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with pre-existing conditions." Romney responded by simply repeating his earlier point: "In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That's part of my health care plan." So what’s the truth? Does Romney have a plan to help people with pre-existing conditions? ‘Obamacare’ vs. the Romney plan The real name of the current health care law is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. At the debate, Romney called "Obamacare," and Obama replied that he didn’t mind the term and had actually "become fond" of it. Under "Obamacare," which goes into effect fully in 2014, insurers can’t reject people for having pre-existing conditions. During the drafting of the law, insurers warned that the provision could drive them out of business if people can wait until they get sick to buy insurance. So to address that concern, the law requires everyone to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. That penalty clause is called "the individual mandate," and the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional this summer. Romney opposes that mandate, and has consistently said the health law should be repealed and replaced. But his health care plan doesn’t pack a lot of details. His website, though, says people "should be guaranteed the ability to retain coverage" if they have "maintained continuous health insurance coverage." That means if you already have health insurance, other insurers can’t deny you if you have pre-existing conditions. (After the debate, his spokesman confirmed this was still his position.) But people who’ve lost coverage for an extended period of time don’t get the same guarantee. How many people would that be? The Obama campaign has said it could be as many as 89 million, a claim we rated Half True. That number is inflated — it counts people who would qualify for public insurance programs, for example. Still, anyone who does go without coverage for an extended period of time and then needs to buy their own insurance could be rejected by private insurers under Romney’s plan. Obama said during the debate existing law already has protections similar as to what Romney has proposed, and he’s right about that. If the 2010 health law disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of less than 63 days. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act established that time frame, and it only allows insurers to look back 18 months for coverage gaps of 63 days or more. Health experts we talked to assume Romney would basically firm up the requirements of that law — which applies primarily to people with employer-based coverage, not less common individual policies — and strengthen it so it also applied to the individual market. It’s also possible under Romney’s plan that some people rejected for coverage for pre-existing conditions would qualify for insurance through state-run "high-risk pools," an idea Romney includes in his health care proposals. Romney encourages states to design their own programs, according to a statement from policy director Lanhee Chen that the Romney campaign sent us. Conservative health experts say Romney’s reforms focus on separating health insurance from employment, and that will cut down on gaps in health coverage. "The idea is that you create a new system in which it's much easier to get insurance yourself, give people a window (a kind of open season) to get insured in that system if they're not already insured, and then after that protect those who are from then on continuously insured," said Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and founding editor of conservative magazine National Review. Our ruling Romney said his health care proposals include protections for pre-existing conditions What he didn’t say at the debate -- but which his website states and advisers confirmed after the debate -- is that people would be protected from denial only if they have been continuously insured. The health care law, though, offers protections whether people have current coverage or not, so it offers more robust protection. The law also includes a requirement that everyone have insurance or pay a tax penalty. Romney’s plan doesn’t have that requirement. Romney did not mention the qualifier that people have to stay insured to get the protection. That’s a significant omission. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-05294	National debt plus unfunded liabilities adds up to $520,000 per American household.	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/may/22/mitt-romney/romney-says-debt-plus-unfunded-liabilities-equals-/	When Mitt Romney traveled around the country campaigning recently, he brought a debt clock with him showing the rising national debt. The total is a mind-boggling, massive number. In St. Petersburg, Fla., on May 16, 2012, Romney explained what the debt and "unfunded liabilities" means for every household. Romney said unfunded liabilities "means promises made by the federal government where there is no money behind it to pay it. … So it's the liabilities (that) add up to, think about this, $520,000 per household. …And this president hasn’t stopped it; he has added to it." Wow -- every family owes more than a half-million? Forget about ever paying that off -- right? We wanted to check if Romney, the presumed Republican nominee for president, was correct that the amount of debt plus unfunded liabilities equals about $520,000 per household. We’re not going to consider responsibility for the debt in this report; both Republicans and Democrats have been responsible over the years. Here, we want to look at whether the number is an accurate reflection of how much debt we have. Romney’s explanation The Romney campaign pointed us to a 2011 news analysis in USA Today. "The $61.6 trillion in unfunded obligations amounts to $528,000 per household," it said. "That's more than five times what Americans have borrowed for everything else — mortgages, car loans and other debt. It reflects the challenge as the number of retirees soars over the next 20 years and seniors try to collect on those spending promises." USA Today provided a breakdown of money owed, based on 2010 figures. • Medicare: $24.8 trillion. "This demographic burst — combined with the addition of a prescription drug benefit in 2006 and rising health care costs generally — has created an unfunded liability of nearly $25 trillion over the lifetime of those now in the program as workers and retirees." • Social Security: $21.4 trillion. "Social Security's long-term shortfall grows about $1.2 trillion annually — a sign of an imbalance between the number of young workers and older beneficiaries, according to the Social Security trustees' annual reports. The $21.4 trillion unfunded liability represents the difference between all taxes that will be paid and all benefits received over the lifetimes of everyone in the system now — workers and beneficiaries alike." • Federal debt: $9.4 trillion. This has grown since the USA Today report. The U.S. Treasury put the debt at about $15.677 trillion as of May 14. Defining an unfunded liability Our main concern with Romney’s statement is that it counts obligations to be paid in the future as debt for today’s families. This might sound reasonable, but thinking of debt this way presents some tricky issues. What Romney did was take the amount predicted that we will owe over the next 75 years for Social Security and Medicare, subtracted what we will take in to fund them, and then divided that sum by the current total of households. Technically, though, shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare aren’t unfunded liabilities, said J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. "Legally, they are not liabilities. They can be referred to accurately as promises or obligations." (He spoke with our sister site PolitiFact Virginia last year on the same topic.) Foster said the benefits do not qualify as liabilities because Congress can change the terms of Medicare and Social Security at any time. Foster told us in an email for this article that Romney’s calculation is valid. However, the figures for unfunded promises differ from common debt. Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution, also pointed out that future benefits for entitlements are not "owed" to seniors in the same way that the public debt is owed to the people and institutions who purchased U.S. government debt. "Congress can and almost certainly will reduce the future benefits promised to people who will receive Medicare and Social Security in the future," Burtless said via email. "Moreover, even if Congress does NOT act before the Trust Funds are depleted, under current law Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries would receive less than the amount of benefits provided to current beneficiaries. "Why? Because the Secretary of the Treasury can only pay for those benefits out of the Trust Funds, and if the Trust Funds are depleted of cash, the rate of spending out of it will be limited to rate at which the Trust Funds are replenished with tax revenues flowing in under the current tax schedule." Michael Linden, of the liberal Center for American Progress, said it’s silly to divide our current debt by the number of households because no one suggests that we equally apportion the debt and pay it all off tomorrow. "How does it make sense to apply potential debt borrowed in 2085 to families today?" he asked. Linden also said that while it’s true that revenues for Social Security and Medicare are projected to fall short of meeting needs over the next several decades, the U.S. will also face the obligation to pay for trillions of dollars on defense over the next 75 years. "That’s because the real worry is not the gap between spending and revenue in any given program (even those that are supposed to have dedicated revenue streams), but the gap between overall spending and overall revenues," Linden said via email. "So my bottom line is that, while Mitt Romney’s math may be right, his implication is wrong, and his number is devoid of any actual meaning." Still, Romney’s underlying point that there is a fiscal imbalance is sound. Alan Auerbach, an economist at Berkeley and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, said that by the numbers, Romney’s calculation is pretty much on target based on the government’s own projections. Auerbach said he has done similar calculations. "I would and do call these unfunded liabilities," he wrote in an email. "They differ from our explicit national debt liabilities in that we can reduce them by undertaking policy reforms, but under current policy they are indeed unfunded commitments. That is, they are obligations in excess of their dedicated funding sources (payroll taxes, premiums paid by Medicare enrollees, etc.)." Our ruling Romney said that the debt and unfunded liabilities of the federal government adds up to $520,000 per household. Romney relied on a 2011 article in USA Today that added up the debt at that time and the amount owed for entitlements -- the largest one was the amount owed for Medicare. Most economists we spoke with disagree with calling the amount we will owe in the future for entitlements "unfunded liabilities," because the government has the power to change the programs, either by reducing spending or increasing taxes. Those obligations are different than our current debt. But Romney’s underlying point is true: Without significant changes, we are on track to owe a mind-boggling sum if we spend large sums without sufficient revenues. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10878	"... study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/21/fred-thompson/thompson-ignores-contrary-death-penalty-research/	The deterrent effect of execution on murders has long been debated, but Thompson suggests the matter has been resolved. Not so. Here is the full assertion from Thompson's broadcast on ABC radio June 27: "...study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders. Some studies show really dramatic effects, with each execution of a murderer deterring as many as 18 or more murders. That's according to Emory University professors, who found as well that delaying execution also leads to further murders. Most studies have concluded that some number of murders between three and 18 are prevented for every application of capital punishment." A dozen research papers in the last six years support Thompson's assertion that capital punishment prevents murders, according to the Associated Press. Three studies get the most attention: a 2006 report by two economists and statistical papers in 2003 and 2006 from the Emory researchers. The Law & Order star accurately quotes the Emory study, but his generalizations about "most studies" ignore significant contrary research. A handful of studies directly challenge pro-deterrence findings by highlighting various missteps in methodology. "These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims, standards such as replication and basic comparisons with other scenarios," said Jeffery Fagan of the Columbia Law School during testimony before a New York legislative panel. Most notable is a paper by two National Bureau of Economic Research fellows who concluded "that execution policy drives little of the year-to-year variation in homicide rates. As to whether executions rise or lower the homicide rate, we remain profoundly uncertain."	None	Fred Thompson	None	None	None	2007-08-21T00:00:00	2007-08-20	['None']
pomt-07198	Accuses President Barack Obama of making contradictory claims about efforts to kill Osama bin Laden in 2008 and 2011.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/07/chain-email/chain-e-mail-accuses-barack-obama-hypocrisy-raid-o/	A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail that’s been making the rounds, accusing President Barack Obama of hypocrisy over the raid that resulted in the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011. A Google search also indicated that the text of the e-mail has been popping up widely in blogs and comment threads. Here’s the full text of the version we received: "Here are the facts, you be the judge. These words were spoken by the same man in 2008 and then again in 2011. "Short and sweet… "OBAMA'S OWN WORDS TRAP HIM: "2008: ‘Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.’ "2011: ‘I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.’ "2008: ‘Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty, and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.’ "2011: ‘I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.’ "2008: ‘Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.’ "2011: ‘Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.’ "I HOPE THIS GETS SENT AROUND TO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE TRUTH!" We thought we’d look into whether the quotations in the e-mail were accurate. We did extensive searches on Google, in the Lexis-Nexis news database and the White House’s own website, as well as checking with a few experts. The White House did not respond to our query. While it’s impossible to prove a negative, we found no evidence to support the notion that Obama said any of these things. In fact, several of the statements are directly contradicted by the evidence we found. We’ll take the quotes one by one. 2008: "Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team." We found occasional references in the media to "assassination teams" that were answerable to Vice President Dick Cheney, but no evidence that Obama ever said anything of the sort. In a March 11, 2009, speech at the University of Minnesota, veteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh referred to the Joint Special Operations Command -- a "special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently," as he put it. "They do not report to anybody, except in the Bush-Cheney days, they reported directly to the Cheney office. ... Congress has no oversight of it. It’s an executive assassination ring essentially...." Later, during the July 15, 2009, edition of Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- a now-defunct nightly show on MSNBC -- the liberal host introduced a segment by saying that it was "time to look at what we know about the Bush-Cheney assassination teams." The segment addressed purported assassination efforts under both the CIA and the Pentagon. The latter "sent killing teams into the field, where they actually killed people," including those affiliated with al-Qaida, Olbermann said. Almost two years later, such comments became somewhat prescient, when details of the bin Laden raid became known. The counter-terrorist team that carried out the raid was the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DevGru for short. (The team is popularly, though incorrectly, known by one of its several former names, SEAL Team Six.") DevGru has been around since the early 1980s, usually shrouded in secrecy given its sensitive work. According to globalsecurity.org, it is a "component" of the Joint Special Operations Command. From what’s been reported, it’s unclear whether DevGru truly was answerable to Cheney during his two terms as vice president. But the group existed, and the bin Laden raid certainly suggests that it has the ability -- at least in some cases -- to act as an "assassination team." Still, the e-mail is wrong to suggest that Obama ever said or wrote that "Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team" before he became president (or, for that matter, after). 2011: "I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden." During his May 1, 2011, announcement of bin Laden’s death, Obama detailed his role in ordering the bin Laden raid. But he never claimed that he had created the unit that carried out the raid (which he didn’t, in any case). Obama said in his announcement that shortly after he took office, "I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al-Qaida, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network. … Last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice. "Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body." In a lengthy interview conducted on May 4, 2011, Obama sounded a similar note. "Obviously we have extraordinary guys," Obama told Steve Kroft of the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes. "Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan. But each iteration of that plan they'd bring back to me. Make a full presentation. We would ask questions. We had multiple meetings in the Situation Room in which we would map out -- and we would actually have a model of the compound and discuss how this operation might proceed, and what various options there were because there was more than one way in which we might go about this." We did not find any evidence that Obama had claimed to have created the special forces team that carried out the raid. 2008: "Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty and must be captured alive and given a fair trial." Obama never said this. In fact, he took the opposite stance in one of the presidential debates in 2008. "If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act, and we will take them out," Obama said. "We will kill bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority." After the raid, we rated his promise to "kill bin Laden" as a Promise Kept. The closest we could find was a comment -- quickly retracted -- that was made in 2003 by Howard Dean. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time. In December 2003, Dean told the Concord Monitor that he had "resisted pronouncing a sentence (on bin Laden) before guilt is found. I still have this old-fashioned notion that even with people like Osama, who is very likely to be found guilty, we should do our best not to, in positions of executive power, not to prejudge jury trials." After a flurry of condemnations, Dean reversed course just a few hours later. He told the Associated Press that, "as an American, I want to make sure he gets the death penalty he deserves." He also issued a statement that said in part, "Bin Laden has admitted that he is responsible for killing 3,000 Americans as well as scores of men, women and children around the world. This is exactly the kind of case that the death penalty is meant for." 2011: "I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden." Obama didn’t use the phrasing cited in the chain e-mail, but as we indicated earlier, there’s no question that he took responsibility for ordering the raid. There is evidence that U.S. forces would have accepted a surrender by bin Laden, rather than killing him, under certain circumstances. After the raid, according to ABC News, State Department legal adviser Harold Koh wrote in a blog post that forces were prepared to capture bin Laden if he had "surrendered in a way that they could safely accept" in accordance with the laws of armed conflict which require the acceptance of a "genuine offer" of surrender, "clearly communicated by the surrendering party" under circumstances where it would be feasible for the forces to accept the offer of surrender. Still, Koh wrote that bin Laden was a lawful target under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress in 2001. It allows military force against those that have "planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks" of Sept. 11, 2001. 2008: "Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated." This statement has a grain of truth, but it is exaggerated. During the campaign, Obama made no secret of his disagreement with elements of the Bush Administration’s national security policy. He promised to "close the detention facility at Guantanamo" (which we have rated a Promise Broken) and to "end the use of torture without exception" (which we have rated In the Works). Obama’s desire to close Guantanamo could be construed as him believing that the facility is "entirely unnecessary," but it’s wrong to say that he believed that detainees shouldn’t be interrogated. Interrogation is a standard procedure in law enforcement and intelligence. Obama wanted to end the use of torture. We also found no evidence that Obama uttered these words. 2011: "Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden." Some, including Cheney, have suggested that the Bin Laden raid benefited from intelligence gained through interrogation techniques that Obama has criticized as torture. This question has not been definitively settled, although the White House downplayed the possibility. "Reporting from detainees was just a slice of the information that has been gathered by incredibly diligent professionals over the years in the intelligence community," White House spokesman Jay Carney said on May 3, 2011. "And it simply strains credulity to suggest that a piece of information that may or may not have been gathered in -- eight years ago somehow directly led to a successful mission on Sunday. That's just not the case." John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said that the words attributed to Obama on Guantanamo "are ludicrous. It is not something he would have said, and there is no evidence that it is something that he did say." And in this case too, we found no evidence that Obama uttered the words attributed to him. "As you may know I have been critical of Obama's national security policies," said Professor Jeff Addicott, director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University School of Law. "That said, I have never heard him make the 2008 remarks, and I follow him very closely. Our ruling A few of the sentiments have some link to reality – Obama did order the raid to kill bin Laden, and he did oppose Guantanamo, even though he ultimately failed to carry through on his promise to close it. The critics may have wished Obama had made these statements, but appears the statements have no basis in reality. It's clear from our research that all six quotes are fabrications. Once again a widely circulated chain e-mail is spreading ridiculous falsehoods about Obama. We rate this e-mail Pants on Fire.

pomt-02262	"Young women today in metropolitan areas" who are childless and single are out-earning childless, single young males.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/09/genevieve-wood/what-pay-gap-young-women-out-earn-men-cities-gop-p/	Why is it that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns? You likely heard the statistic, which was slapped all over the cable news networks Tuesday to mark "Equal Pay Day." To many Democrats, it symbolizes an unfairness in the pay structures of jobs all across America. But conservatives say the situation is more complex, and as much about life choices as some fundamental inequality. We watched the debate play out between conservative pundit Sabrina Schaeffer and liberal pundit Elizabeth Plank on MSNBC’s The Reid Report, and again later between former White House adviser Anita Dunn and conservative pundit Genevieve Wood on CNN’s The Lead with Jake Tapper. "If you compare women to men in the same job with similar background, similar experiences that they bring to the table, the wage gap all but disappears," Wood said. "Women have made great strides. Instead of celebrating that, this is a political year, the White House wants to portray this war on women." "Not only are the numbers wrong -- young women today in metropolitan areas, for example, are actually outperforming males in that same category all over the country." Dunn pushed back. "I'm going to jump in a little on that because I think that it's true that women are making enormous progress, but you know, as well as I do, that as they get older in the workforce, that those disparities start to grow and there are all kinds of reasons that that happens and an important discussion across the board is how do we continue to make sure that the progress continues," she said. PolitiFact has given you the nuts and bolts about the 77 cents statistic -- you can read the two most important works in this area here and here. Basically, there is a wage gap, but it tends to disappear when you compare women and men in the exact same jobs who have the same levels of experience and education. We at PunditFact want to look at the argument being offered by conservatives. In this case, we are checking Wood -- a conservative pundit with the Heritage Foundation -- who said, "Young women today in metropolitan areas, for example, who are childless, single young women are actually outperforming males in that same category all over the country." Basis of the claim Wood directed us to a 2012 U.S. News and World Report article that was reposted on the website of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The article includes the following line: "Census data from 2008 show that single, childless women in their 20s now earn 8 percent more on average than their male counterparts in metropolitan areas." That matches up to what Wood said on CNN. Drilling down further, the reference comes more directly from an analysis of Census Bureau data performed by James Chung of Reach Advisors. Reach Advisors is a private research firm based in New York. Chung spent about a year analyzing 2008 data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, looking at the earnings of men and women in metropolitan areas. The actual study was never released, just some of the findings, Chung told PunditFact this week. Among what was released in September 2010 was this: The median full-time salaries of young women in America’s metropolitan areas are 8 percent higher than those of the guys in their peer group. A breakdown provided for Time magazine included a look at specific cities. In Atlanta, young unmarried childless women made 21 percent more than men, Chung found. In Los Angeles, young women made 12 percent more than their cohorts. The news also was reported by NPR and CBS News. The American Enterprise Institute converted specific numbers into this graphic to show how women are out-earning men in some cases: Chung said he has not updated his analysis to how the figures have changed since 2008 and "no longer circulate (the analysis) as current since it's now four years out of date." No one else, that we’re aware of, has attempted to recreate Chung’s specific analysis, and we found no criticism of Chung’s methodology. We did come across an analysis by Pew Research, which looked earnings trends for all women between 25 and 34 (a broader and older group). Compared to all men of the same age, Pew Research found women earn 93 percent of what a man earns. That's a smaller gap than when considering all women and all men, Pew found. Analyzing Wood’s statement We sent Wood’s statement to Chung and asked for his take. While Wood is careful to note that she was talking about "childless, single young women" in metropolitan areas, Chung said that Wood failed to note that the analysis concerned median incomes between men and women. Why is that important? Median income figures look at earnings in the aggregate, rather than compare like jobs or professions. That leaves the claim open to the same criticism Republicans levy against Democrats when they claim women earn 77 cents for every $1 a man does. (Namely, that the statistic isn’t a true apple-to-apples comparison.) In the case of Chung’s findings, the reason why young women in metropolitan areas earn more than young men is that they are 50 percent more likely to graduate from college. "As a result, they populate more of the entry-level knowledge-based economy jobs than young men," Chung said. Chung said it "would be totally incorrect to imply that these women outearn men with similar jobs or similar educations." "The bottom line is that in a world where most players are looking for a sound bite to support a specific position, this is actually a rather complex issue," Chung said. "Things aren't exactly as equal as some people say, but it's not always as dire as others say." Our ruling Wood said, "Young women today in metropolitan areas, for example, who are childless, single young women are actually outperforming males in that same category all over the country." The statement tracks back to a credible analysis of 2008 Census Bureau data that looks at median incomes in metropolitan areas -- a fact that Wood ignores. But she gets most of the other details correct, and while the information is now six years old, we were unable to track down more recent research to confirm or disprove the point. Finally, we should note that this comparison holds true because childless, single young women tend to have more education and qualify for higher paying jobs. Wood’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Genevieve Wood	None	None	None	2014-04-09T15:43:06	2014-04-08	['None']
pomt-09093	The U.S. spends $4 billion on research and development for energy, while spending $350 billion on oil from foreign countries, "many of whom are our enemies."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/23/jeff-greene/oil-imports-energy-and-enemies-part-its-right/	While much of Florida's attention has been focused on Republican Marco Rubio and former Republican Charlie Crist in the U.S. Senate race, there's also a vigorous contest on the Democratic side. Congressman Kendrick Meek of Miami has been challenged by Jeff Greene, a billionaire real estate investor from Palm Beach, and the two faced off in a debate in West Palm Beach on June 22, 2010. Being dutiful fact-checkers, we tuned in to see what was said. One of the topics was the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and what it means for national energy policy. "This situation never should have happened, it's a big failure of the career politicians like Kendrick Meek who have been sitting in Washington and not creating an energy policy," Greene said. "You know that we only spend $4 billion, this is what the Congress spends, on research and development for energy when we're sending $350 billion abroad to enemies, I mean, in some countries, so many of whom are enemies. We need to increase research and development." Greene's a political newcomer, but he slung the facts like an experienced political player. We decided to check Greene's facts on energy R&D and oil imports. We'll take it step by step. First, Greene said that Congress spends $4 billion on research and development for energy. We checked the last budget for the U.S. Department of Energy, for fiscal year 2010, and found that Greene was relatively close. Congress appropriated $4.9 billion in 2010 for basic science through the Energy Department. The department asked for a little more for next year, at $5.1 billion. The economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, sent some money -- about $1.6 billion -- to basic research. But the bulk of the stimulus money went to applied energy projects like weatherizing buildings, cleaning up nuclear sites, and electrical grid improvement. Next, we wanted to check whether we're spending $350 billion on foreign oil. This was a little trickier. An independent government agency, the Energy Information Administration, publishes regular information on how much oil we import in barrels. The agency also publishes average prices of crude oil. It does not, however, publish a number on annual spending on foreign oil. T. Boone Pickens, however, takes those numbers and combines them to calculate how much the U.S. spends on foreign oil on a monthly and annual basis. Pickens is an oil tycoon who advocates for energy independence through his website, The Pickens Plan. Keep in mind these numbers are an approximation based on average price, not actual spending. For the last 12 months, from April 2009 to May 2010, the U.S. spent about $314 billion on foreign oil, according to the Pickens numbers. The cost of imported oil has been even more in the past, when the price and consumption were higher. We were more concerned with Greene's statement that we were sending money to countries that are our "enemies." The U.S. doesn't have an "enemies" list, but we have to note the U.S. does not buy imported oil from Iran or North Korea, two countries with whom we have chilly relations. (In fact, oil imports from Iran are banned by the U.S. government.) The country we imported the most oil from in 2009 was Canada, followed by Mexico, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Russia, Algeria, Angola, Iraq, Brazil, Colombia, the Virgin Islands, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Ecuador, the Netherlands, Norway, Equitorial Guinea, and others. (See the complete list.) Which of these countries are our "enemies"? We asked the Greene campaign for a response. Paul Blank, an adviser to the Greene campaign, said that Greene was speaking of individual Islamic extremists in the Middle East, not governments. The money the U.S. sends to the Middle East to buy oil can make its way into the pockets of terrorists indirectly, Blank said. We understand the point, but we're not going to delve into terror financing here, because it's not what Greene said. In fact, he said twice during the debate that we're sending money to countries that are our enemies. He said at another point, "We're sending $350 billion a year now to foreign countries to buy oil, many of whom are our enemies. And you know what, that shouldn't be happening." We're ruling here on Greene's statement that we're spending $4 billion on research and development for energy while spending $350 billion on foreign oil, which goes to some countries that are "our enemies." His numbers are close on how much we spend, but he's off about the countries being enemies. Canada and Mexico are friendly with the U.S. We may not always have the best relations with a few of the other countries on the list -- Venezuela comes to mind -- but we have a hard time seeing how any of them rise to the level of "enemy." So we rate his statement Half True.	None	Jeff Greene	None	None	None	2010-06-23T17:54:30	2010-06-22	['United_States']
pomt-06364	"Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/03/barack-obama/obama-says-health-law-will-kick-millions-next-year/	In a television interview with the Tampa Fox affiliate, President Barack Obama discussed last year’s sweeping health care legislation, a centerpiece of his re-election campaign and a favorite point of attack by his challengers. The law is designed to provide health insurance to nearly every American by creating insurance exchanges for people to purchase plans and expanding Medicaid for the poor. It includes an individual mandate requiring people to buy coverage in order to spread risk and costs across the population. That provision in particular is the subject of numerous court challenges and is the least popular aspect of the law. Interviewer Mark Wilson pointed to that fact in the Nov. 1, 2011, interview, noting "54 percent of Americans favor repealing some version some part of that law. As you know, Florida leads the way in repealing it. What would you do differently now with regards to health care reform, knowing what we know now?" Obama responded by touting some of the law’s benefits. "Well, look, keep in mind a million young people around the country have health care that didn't have it before because they can stay on their parents’ health care plan. Millions of families all across the country benefited from additional drug benefits as a consequence of that health care plan," the president said. "Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get health care next year because of that law." The "next year" part of that struck us as suspect, so we decided to check it out. The law and its many provisions are designed to take effect in steps over a period of years. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a timeline posted on its website explaining the phase-in. The changes set to take effect in 2012 mainly involve payments to Medicare. The individual mandate, along with Medicaid expansion and establishment of the insurance exchanges, doesn't kick in until 2014. Those are the provisions of the law expected to give millions of Americans access to health insurance, and thus health care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that next year only about 1 million more Americans will gain health insurance. The figure balloons to 19 million in 2014, and 30 million in 2016 when those concrete changes are fully implemented. Parts of the law already up and running -- which have chipped away at the number of uninsured Americans -- include policies for people with pre-existing conditions and an allowance for young adults to remain on their parents’ health plans up to age 26. We asked the White House what Obama’s "next year" claim was based on but did not hear back. In addition, as we’ve noted before, the individual mandate faces a significant battle in the courts and is likely to end up being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. If it is ruled unconstitutional, the CBO projects that 16 million fewer people will become insured. Other studies put that reduction at between 8 million and 24 million. Our ruling Obama said "Thirty million Americans, including a lot of people in Florida, are going to be able to get healthcare next year because of that law." The CBO, a nonpartisan source, predicts only 1 million people will benefit in 2012, with the significant increases coming in 2014 and 2016. Plus, the law’s future is uncertain. The president is understandably enthusiastic about seeing his signature legislation take effect. But he misstated the timing of how many people will gain health insurance and when. It’s not happening next year. We rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-11-03T17:35:54	2011-11-01	['United_States', 'Florida']
pomt-00066	Says Maine Democrat Jared Golden "supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/02/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-way-saying-jared-golden-wants-take-away-so/	Just days before voters head to the polls, the National Republican Congressional Committee released a new ad blasting Jared Golden, the Democratic candidate running for the U.S. House seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. The "Golden Years" ad targets senior voters by claiming that Golden will "steal" their golden years to "pay for his reckless agenda." Here's the NRCC ad in full: "They call them the golden years, when you’re supposed to enjoy the life you worked so hard to build. But politician Jared Golden wants to turn your golden years into his. Golden supports a reckless bill to end Medicare as we know it. And he supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs. Jared Golden would steal your golden years to pay for his reckless agenda. Maine seniors can’t afford that risk." The "reckless" bill the ad refers to is Sen. Bernie Sanders’ "Medicare for All" proposal, which Golden has said he supports, following improvements to the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives have continuously said that such a system would end Medicare "as we know it" by creating a new program funded by the government and open to everyone, not just those 65 and older. (See this fact-check.) Here, we are going to focus on the accusation that Golden "supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs." The claim is based on Golden’s one-time support of a statewide referendum, often referred to as "Homecare for All," that will appear on the ballot in Maine on Nov. 6. The initiative would raise taxes on wealthier Mainers to help pay for a universal home care program. While there is debate over who the tax will affect, it has no direct ties to Social Security, would not cause people to lose their benefits and Golden does not support it in its current form. The Maine referendum in question The citizen-initiated referendum would fund a home care program for elderly and disabled Mainers by implementing a tax on higher incomes in the state. It would also create a government board to administer the funds. The ballot question seeks to fund the system by adding a 3.8 percent surtax on incomes of more than $128,400. The Maine home care program would be paid for by collected on households earning income above $128,400. Funds would be managed by a board made up of industry representatives and home care recipients. The effort intends to solve a long-term problem in Maine’s home health care system, where aides make an average hourly age of $12.41, according to the Maine Labor Department. It is worth noting, too, that Maine holds the top spot as the oldest state in the country, according to a 2017 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which found the median age in Maine was 44.6, essentially unchanged from 2016. So how would this affect Social Security? It wouldn’t. The closest connection is the threshold in which the Maine home care tax would kick in, on incomes more than $128,400. That’s because the government funds Social Security by taxing incomes up to $128,400. The NRCC cites Golden’s one-time support of the initiative as an attempt to erode seniors’ Social Security to pay for the program. The group pointed to a May 2018 op-ed Golden penned in the Portland Press Herald. "If you’re like more than 98 percent of people in this state, you already pay a tax on all of the income you earn in order to fund Social Security, and your employer does the same," Golden wrote in the op-ed. "Individuals who are paid more than $128,400 a year, however, currently do not pay any Social Security tax on income greater than that amount. The referendum would ask them to pay a bit more of their fair share on all of their income, like the rest of us already do." But Golden’s campaign said he wrote that before language changed in the final wording of the bill. Golden actually no longer supports the bill, because it could apply to families earning more than $128,400 a year as opposed to individuals. Golden’s campaign manager Jon Breed told us that while Golden believes there is a growing problem in Maine's home health care system, he "does not agree that families with incomes over $128,000 should face a 3.8 percent tax increase." Since the bill’s language was altered, several analyses have concluded the measure would include married couples filing jointly. The NRCC also pointed us to a report on the proposal by the Maine Center for Economic Policy, a left-leaning research and policy organization. At one point in the analysis, it says that "Mainers will be asked whether to partially close the Social Security tax loophole to fund a universal home care program." The report says the initiative would be the first of its kind in the country, and creates a new tax structure for high income earners that picks up where Social Security taxes leaves off. The tax also applies to non-wage income, which is currently untaxed by payroll-type taxes. What does that all mean for Social Security? Not much, as the threshold is the referendum’s only link to Social Security. The home care program would be funded through a new tax on high earners, not Social Security. Our ruling The National Republican Campaign Committee said Golden "supports using your Social Security to fund other government programs." The group is referring to Golden’s previous support of a state referendum that will appear on the ballot in Maine and would implement a tax on wealthier Mainers to fund a home care program. (Golden’s campaign says he no longer supports it after a recent change.) The program would not result in cuts to Social Security. The NRCC distorted a thin link, as the Maine tax would be levied above the current Social Security cut-off of $128,400. Again, it would not result in a decrease of senior’s Social Security benefits.

pomt-05362	"The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-government-job-losses-his-watch-/	In a May 8, 2012, speech on the economy in Albany, N.Y., President Barack Obama sought to put the nation’s economic challenges on his watch in historical context. He especially sought to explain how hard it’s been to increase the national employment level when governments have been hemorrhaging jobs. These job losses, he suggested, have weighed down the comparatively healthy private-sector job-creation statistics. "It's worth noting, by the way -- this is just a little aside -- after there was a recession under Ronald Reagan, government employment went way up," Obama said. "It went up after the recessions under the first George Bush and the second George Bush. So each time there was a recession with a Republican president … we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment. The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me." That paragraph includes a lot of claims, but for this item, we’ll pare it down to one sentence: "The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me." To check this, we turned to employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We’ve defined "government employment" in the most expansive way -- a combination of federal, state and local government employment -- since Obama didn’t specify a particular level of government. (His press office did not return our inquiry for this story.) As we’ll see, the most difficult part of analyzing this claim is figuring out what time frame to use; using different periods can lead to different conclusions. So we’ll look at a few scenarios. Has government employment ever gone down previously "during a recession"? If you look at the double-dip recession that lasted from January 1980 to November 1982, government employment did go down during the recession. (Officially, these were two recessions during that stretch. However, they were so closely spaced, and with such a short "recovery" in between, that the statistics are a lot less messy if you consider them to be one long recession.) During the official period of this double-dip recession, government employment fell by 224,000 workers, or about 1.3 percent. The decline was even steeper if you start counting from the peak of government employment, which came four months into the recession, and if you stop at the low point for government employment, which came five months before the end of the recession. The decline over this period was 693,000 jobs, or 4.1 percent. Either of these two declines was steeper than what Obama has faced. In fact, between the most recent recession’s start (which occurred on President George W. Bush’s watch in December 2007) and its official end (under Obama in June 2009) government employment actually increased by 194,000 jobs, or a little under 1 percent. So Obama's claim is way off. Not only did another president experience a decline in government jobs during a recession, but even Obama himself experienced an increase during the recession he inherited. There is another way of looking at it, though. Has government employment ever gone down previously during a combined recession and recovery? You can also look at the combination of the recession and the recovery. April 2012, the latest month for which BLS data is available, represents the 52nd month after the starting date of the last recession, December 2007. In that time span, government payrolls have declined by 407,000, or about 1.8 percent. The equivalent month after the start of the 1980 recession is May 1984. Between January 1980 and May 1984, government payrolls fell by 98,000, or 0.6 percent. So counting both the recession itself as well as the length of the current recovery, government jobs did fall in the 1980-1982 recession. While the recession that started in 2007 has been more severe, the recession and recovery in 1980-1982 did in fact result in lost jobs. This further undercuts the accuracy of Obama’s statement. Has government employment ever gone down previously during a recovery? You can also look at recoveries by themselves, ignoring what happened with government jobs when the recession was officially under way. If you start counting with the final month of the 1980-1982 recession (November 1982) the numbers of government jobs essentially stagnated for more than a year. In November 1982, the number stood at 15,977,000. Fourteen months later, in January 1984, it had only increased by 33,000, a jump of two-tenths of 1 percent. In fact, it took until August 1984 -- 21 months after the end of the recession -- for government employment to once again reach its initial pre-recession level. And it took an additional 11 months for government employment to reach its recession-era peak. This means that government employment finally crawled out of its recession-era hole 32 months after the end of the recession, and a whopping 67 months -- that’s five and a half years -- after the recession began. By then, the economy had improved enough to carry Reagan to a landslide re-election victory. By contrast, private-sector jobs began a consistent and years-long rise almost exactly as the recession ended in November 1982 -- more than a year before government jobs began to recover. In other words, when Obama says that "each time there was a recession with a Republican president … we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment," he’s not accurate. Reagan hardly rode robust government job growth to a national economic recovery. Quite the contrary: Under Reagan, a huge number of government jobs were lost during the recession, and it took more than a year after the recovery began to even begin making a dent in the government-job deficit from the recession. Where Obama has a point Obama is correct that government employment did go up under Reagan -- eventually. It just took a while before this expansion gathered steam. In the three years between January 1984 and January 1987, when the broader recovery was already well under way, government employment soared by about 6.4 percent, with consistent month-to-month gains. That’s very healthy growth, but it’s important to note that those government job increases came after the larger economy was back humming along. Obama, by contrast, has experienced nothing like that. Government employment did rise modestly during the official recessionary period, government employment peaked in April 2009 (not counting a stretch in mid-2010 when the Census Bureau made a lot of temporary hires). But then it began falling -- severely. Since April 2009, the number of government jobs at all levels has fallen by 706,000, or 3 percent. While that’s proportionately smaller than the peak-to-trough decline in government employment in the 1980-1982 recession, government employment in the current recovery shows no signs of starting a sustained increase. At the equivalent point in the recovery from the 1980-1982 recession, government employment had already rebounded by 4 percent. Obama can only dream of such numbers. Our ruling Obama is wrong when he suggests that "the only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me." It's not true if you just look at the recessionary period itself, and it's not true if you look at a combination of the recession and the recovery -- in both cases, it happened during the 1980-1982 recession. And while government employment did eventually go up following the Reagan-era recession, the rise began more than a year after private-sector employment picked up, which negates Obama's argument that his predecessors were able to compensate for weak private-sector job creation with accelerated government hiring. We rate Obama’s claim False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-05-10T10:48:44	2012-05-08	['None']
pomt-07212	"Every time you buy an airline ticket, the federal government runs a background check on you."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/jun/05/don-zimmerman/gop-activist-says-federal-government-runs-backgrou/	Urging state lawmakers to revive a proposal barring airport security personnel in Texas from touching passengers’ private parts, an Austin member of the State Republican Executive Committee said federal authorities already know plenty about those who fly. "The fact is, every time you buy an airline ticket, the federal government runs a background check on you," Don Zimmerman said in a May 31 press release from the Texas Republican Freedom Coalition. "They know who you are before you board the plane." Pre-flight background checks on me, you and even Mrs. Olsen down the street? After asking Zimmerman for his backup information, we turned to the agency that oversees the security checks of air passengers, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. Online, we found a November 2010 TSA press release in which Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Homeland Security, announced that passengers on flights within or bound for the United States were now being checked against government watch lists, in keeping with "a key 9/11 Commission recommendation." The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required Homeland Security to compare passenger information to watch lists kept by the government, according to an administration web post. That job, previously handled by airlines, was fully implemented by late November 2010. The agency’s program, Secure Flight, checks each potential passenger’s name, birth date and gender against terrorist watch lists, the release says, before passengers receive boarding passes. According to information on another administration web site, TSA matches the name, gender and birth date submissions by passengers against government watch lists to identify known and suspected terrorists; prevent individuals on the government’s "No Fly List" from boarding and Identify individuals on the "Selectee List" for enhanced screening. According to an undated post on the agency’s site, fewer than 50,000 people are on the lists, which consist of individuals "identified by law enforcement and intelligence entities as legitimate threats to transportation who require either additional screening or are prohibited from boarding an aircraft." Separately, Fox News in December 2009 quoted an unidentified senior administration official saying more than 400,000 individuals are in the Terrorist Screening Data Base (TSDB), which Fox called the main identities database within the government for international terrorism. Those names are taken from the list of 550,000 individuals in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), described in the news report as the intelligence community’s central repository of information on known and suspected international terrorists. Fox News said less than 4,000 of the names in the TSDB are on the "No Fly" list and another 14,000 names are on the "Selectee" list, which mandates calls for mandatory secondary screening. The agency says the lists are kept by an FBI entity, the Terrorist Screening Center, which quotes a Homeland Security directive stating that "only individuals who are known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism" are supposed to be on the watch lists. U.S. citizens are included on the list, it says, if there is a reasonable suspicion that they are known or reasonably suspected of terrorism. However, the center says in another online post that 95 percent of the individuals on the watch list are not U.S. citizens or legal residents and the "vast majority" are not even in the U.S." The release says that under Secure Flight, "99 percent of passengers are cleared to print boarding passes at home or at a self-serve kiosk." Individuals "found to match watch list parameters will be subject to secondary screening, a law enforcement interview or prohibition from boarding an aircraft, depending on the specific case." Is checking watch lists equivalent to doing background checks? Nope, said Dallas-based TSA spokesman Luis Casanova. "Bottom line," Casanova told us by email, "we compare against watch lists, we do not conduct background checks (unless you are coming to work with us)." Zimmerman guided us to the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center, whose executive director, Marc Rotenberg, said in an interview that after 9/11, the government sought to require full-fledged checks of passengers, but those plans were cancelled in 2004. He called the current comparison of passenger information to names on watch lists "streamlined background checks." Law professors with expertise in this area said the use of watch lists isn’t the same as background checks. Matthew Finkin of the University of Illinois, who specialties include privacy issues, said background checks, most often invoked by prospective employers, commonly consider someone’s credit worthiness, outstanding criminal charges and civil litigation, bankruptcies, driving and marital records -- even their use of social networking. He said he’s not heard of airlines running background checks of all passengers: "The airlines are not going to spend that kind of money. Why would they care if you have a speeding ticket?" Counter-terrorism legal expert Gregory Maggs of the George Washington University Law School similarly said background checks occur when individuals apply for government jobs or seek a security clearance. Doing them for every airline passenger would be unmanageable, he said: "Too many people buying airline tickets." Zimmerman said by email that the FBI and TSA are "large, powerful bureaucratic organizations with very significant resources to check on travelers. It would also make sense that they would not divulge all the depth of details of what they do." Upshot: Every airline passenger must hurdle a check of basic personal information against a federal database before stepping onto a commercial flight. But these do not constitute actual background checks. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Don Zimmerman	None	None	None	2011-06-05T06:00:00	2011-05-31	['None']
pomt-03363	Says that in Curry County, "if you make a 911 call you’re likely to wait for an hour for a response."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/jul/13/jeff-kruse/likely-911-response-time-curry-county-one-hour/	On the final day of the 2013 Oregon Legislature, lawmakers approved a bill that will allow Gov. John Kitzhaber and leaders to declare a public safety state of emergency in certain rural counties hit hard by the expiration of federal timber payments. A state takeover is certainly a radical idea. A state takeover that also imposes temporary taxes to help pay for the state takeover is a radical and horrifying idea for voters of this tax-shy county. The governor stepped up his efforts to pass House Bill 3453 after voters in Curry and Josephine counties rejected tax measures in May. Sen. Jeff Kruse, R-Roseburg, dislikes the bill but voted for it, noting on the Senate floor that the situation is dire in Curry County. "Currently if you make a 911 call you’re likely to wait for an hour for a response. That’s the reality," he said. Is that true? Is that the wait time for a response to a 911 call in Curry County? We called the Curry County Sheriff’s Office, figuring Sheriff John Bishop would know. The executive assistant, Lisa Combs, said that an hour wait is not the norm. But they’re down to four road deputies -- plus two deputies dedicated to marine calls -- to cover 1,648 square miles. "Cold calls sometimes do take a long time," Combs said. "We try to respond to high priority in-progress type calls but again, they’re not on 24-7. If we have to call someone in the middle of the night, it takes time." "Some calls, we’re there in two minutes or in five minutes, but if we only have four deputies and I’ve got one on and" he’s in one side of the county and the call’s from the other side, it will take awhile, she said. In May, Curry voters rejected a $4.5 million five-year property tax increase that would have boosted the numbers from four deputies to 12, allowing them to be positioned at both ends of the county. Curry residents pay the second lowest effective tax rate in Oregon, according to 2012-13 state figures and the second lowest permanent tax rate as of 2010-11. David Brock Smith, chairman of the Curry County Board of Commissioners, said the county had more than a dozen deputies on patrol a decade or so ago. The failed tax increase would have paid for two deputies to be on patrol 24 hours a day, seven days a week, he said. "So in any given time the maximum would be less than 30 minutes" response time, he said. Cities within the county have police but they are limited to calls within city limits, and they don’t provide around the clock patrol either. Nearby Josephine County has it bad as well. In May, National Public Radio aired a story about a woman’s harrowing 911 call to Josephine County dispatchers, in August 2012. The terrified woman reported that her ex-boyfriend was trying to break into her house. He had put her in the hospital before. But it was 5 a.m. Saturday, and deputies were not available. The call transferred to Oregon State Police, also unavailable. The ex-boyfriend pried open the front door and attacked the caller. We checked in with Kruse. He said it was not his intent to convey that an hour wait is the norm in Curry County. "It’s not always the case, but potentially, it could be," he said. "There are times when there’s nobody on patrol. They just don’t have the manpower." The drive between Brookings in the south and Port Orford in the north takes about an hour, according to Mapquest. If a deputy is occupied in the south and a call comes in from the north, yes, the response time could take an hour, or more. We did circle back to the Curry County Sheriff’s Office to ask if there are average response times for when a deputy is dispatched. "I couldn’t even begin to tell you," Combs said. So, we don’t have a breakdown of response times for 911 calls, which means we can’t tell you how the hour wait compares with any sort of norm. Kruse’s use of the word "likely" could be taken by some listeners to mean "more likely than not," and there’s no evidence to suggest that is the case. Sometimes the response time in Curry County is better and sometimes it is worse, making the statement partially accurate. Response times can range from mere minutes to the next day of business, depending on the details of the call. We find his statement is missing important details and rate it Half True.

pomt-09591	“The largest tax increase that we have ever had in our state is yours – it is the business margins tax that you signed, governor.”	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/21/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-revised-business-tax-created-states/	The revamped business tax was a point of contention between Gov. Rick Perry and Republican opponent Kay Bailey Hutchison, a U.S. senator from Texas, during the first GOP gubernatorial debate. Portraying Perry as an enemy of business, Hutchison lashed out at him for signing legislation in 2006 that restructured the state’s franchise tax as part of a tax swap intended to reduce school property taxes. “The largest tax increase that we have ever had in our state is yours – it is the business margins tax that you signed, governor,” Hutchison said. Perry rebutted later in the debate that he has in fact cut the business tax — a claim we'll address at a later date. (When it comes to tax matters, it's dangerous for truth-testers as well as politicians to bite off more than they can chew.) For now, we'll gnaw on Hutchison's claim: Did the revised franchise tax, often called the margins tax, amount to the biggest tax increase in Texas history? For most qualifying businesses, the franchise tax is 1 percent of their total annual revenue minus one of three options: the cost of goods sold, employee compensation or 30 percent of total revenue. In support for its claim that the revised tax was indeed historic, the Hutchison camp offered a background paper citing several news articles and government documents. Among the citations was an item from the Dallas Morning News Trail Blazers campaign blog, also mentioned by Hutchison in the debate, stating that the "largest tax increase in Texas" occurred under Perry's leadership. But the newspaper made an important distinction that Hutchison omitted in the debate: The article included both a tobacco tax and the franchise tax as the sources of that increase. In the information that it provided after the debate, the Hutchison campaign said that "Perry's new margin tax cost taxpayers $8.8 billion" over the 2008-09 biennium and compared that figure with the estimated $5.7 billion tax package signed into law in 1987 by Gov. Bill Clements. At the time, the 1987 legislation was widely reported to be the largest tax hike in the state’s history. But it turns out there are fatal flaws in the Hutchison campaign's math. For instance, the $8.8 billion figure is the total amount generated by the franchise tax, not the net increase resulting from the revision that became law under Perry. So it's misleading for the campaign to cite that number when discussing tax increases. The actual increase — revenue above what the old franchise tax would have brought in — was about $3 billion, significantly less than what had been projected. Let's compare that with the largest single piece of the Clements-era tax package: a hike in the sales tax. After it was enacted, sales tax revenues went up $4.2 billion during 1988-89 compared with the previous biennium. If you're keeping track, that's significantly more than the $3 billion wrought by changes in the franchise tax. However, the Texas state comptroller's office says that it cannot say with certainty how much of that 1988-89 sales tax revenue increase can be attributed to the legislation per se and how much is due to other factors, such as increased consumer spending. As we evaluated Hutchison's claim, we also learned that the broadening of the franchise tax did not necessarily mean that businesses paid more taxes overall after the 2006 changes. Some companies actually wound up paying less, thanks to the reduction in school property taxes that was part of the deal. According to experts, there are several ways to try to determine which was the state's largest tax increase in history. We used the simplest, looking at total dollars brought in. Another way would be to calculate the percentage increase of franchise tax revenue and compare that to percentage increases in other state taxes. Taking the percentage approach, we found that the 51 percent increase in franchise tax revenue for 2008-09, compared with the previous biennium, was not the largest for that tax. After the Legislature revamped the franchise tax in 1991, revenue grew 92 percent over the next two years. Hutchison's campaign took the dollar approach to the franchise tax instead of percentages. But on either basis, her claim is flawed. First, the franchise tax that Perry signed did not result in an $8.8 billion increase in tax revenue. Second, it appears that previous revisions of the sales tax have resulted in larger revenue increases. Third, examined on a percentage basis, the new franchise tax didn't set a revenue record. Hutchison bit off more than she could chew with her campaign rhetoric. Her claim that the expansion of the business franchise tax represents the largest increase in state history is False.

pomt-08394	Says John Kitzhaber wants a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes.	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/23/chris-dudley/chris-dudley-says-john-kitzhaber-wants-sales-tax-s/	Sometimes, a claim comes along that’s so juicy it makes PolitiFact Oregon salivate. This is one: Republican Chris Dudley charges that his opponent in Oregon’s race for governor, Democrat John Kitzhaber, wants a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes. He makes the claim in a new television ad, "Again," which has audio and video footage of Kitzhaber from various events, including the Portland City Club in 2000 and a KGW/The Oregonian debate in April. Here’s the full text: Voiceover (VO): Kitzhaber failed Oregon because his answer is always the same. John Kitzhaber: I have probably had more tax increases attached to my name -- proposals I oughta say -- than any other governor. VO: Now he’s at it again. John Kitzhaber: Obviously, a retail sales tax is one of the options. VO: Even worse, Kitzhaber says we need a sales tax so people without jobs pay taxes. VO: Taxing the unemployed? We need jobs, not more taxes. VO: John Kitzhaber, even his new ideas are old. It’s time for a new direction. In the ad, the Dudley campaign pulls this from an Oct. 8 Portland Tribune article: "Kitzhaber did not hesitate to use the ‘sales tax’ term.... As incomes shrink and the number of jobless remains high, he said, it illustrates more clearly why Oregon needs to stop depending so much on personal income ...." (Dudley emphasis) Squeezing taxes from the unemployed to prop up state spending? How mean! But take a look at the words from the story left out of the ad: "Kitzhaber did not hesitate to use the "sales tax" term, though he said it’s just one of the options that should be under discussion so the state is not so reliant on income taxes. As incomes shrink and the number of jobless remains high, he said, it illustrates more clearly why Oregon needs to stop depending so much on personal income taxes to pay for the bulk of its general fund budget." (our emphasis) Very sneaky. Kitzhaber has long advocated for a sales tax to help stabilize Oregon’s roller-coaster reliance on personal and corporate income taxes. The Portland Tribune article clearly shows that Kitzhaber was not advocating a sales tax as a means to get more money out of the out-of-work, but to increase the diversity of Oregon’s tax base. An August 2010 study by The Tax Foundation confirmed Oregon’s heavy reliance on individual income taxes, ranking the state No. 2, just after Maryland. But before handing down a ruling, PolitiFact Oregon wanted to check out tax burdens in Washington and in Oregon, just to see how a sales tax would affect the poor, which presumably includes many folks out of work. Oregon taxes income -- including unemployment compensation, as does the federal government -- but not sales. Washington does not tax income, but assesses a base 6.5 percent tax on goods. In Seattle, the sales tax is 9.5 percent. We found an interesting study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a liberal think tank out of Washington, D.C. Its November 2009 report found that Washington was the most regressive state in the country, where households in the lowest 20 percent spend about 17.3 percent of their income on taxes. In Oregon, the figure for that income group is 8.7 percent. The average among states is 10.9 percent. Clearly, it’s a burden to be poor in Washington. Kitzhaber never said anything about implementing a sales tax to make sure the unemployed pay into Oregon’s tax base. We rate this Pants on Fire: The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Comment on this item.	None	Chris Dudley	None	None	None	2010-10-23T06:00:00	2010-10-14	['None']
pomt-12001	DACA was "a mere memo from the Department of Homeland security under Barack Obama, which violated the laws."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/22/roy-moore/debate-roy-moore-claims-daca-immigration-rules-vio/	During a debate for Alabama’s open U.S. Senate seat, former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore blasted a controversial immigration policy recently ended by President Donald Trump as being illegal. Republican Roy Moore squared off in Montgomery on Sept. 21, 2017, against U.S. Sen. Luther Strange, who replaced Jeff Sessions when Sessions became attorney general. The winner of the GOP runoff on Sept. 26 faces Democrat Doug Jones on Dec. 12. Moore, who was removed from the court in 2003 after refusing a federal order to take down a monument of the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Judicial Building, attacked Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The program protected from deportation immigrants who came to the United States as children and lived here illegally, known as Dreamers. Sessions, calling the situation a "failure to enforce immigration laws," announced a phaseout of DACA on Sept. 5. (Renewal applications can be submitted until Oct. 5.) The Trump administration said no current beneficiaries will be affected before March 5, 2018, giving Congress time to act. "Obviously, Congress did not do their duty on DACA, which was a mere memo from the Department of Homeland security under Barack Obama, which violated the laws," Moore said. He said he didn’t consider the policy valid, preferring action from lawmakers. Congress hasn’t passed any laws concerning Dreamers, but does that mean DACA violated current law? It’s certainly been a contentious policy that has caused a lot of debate, but there is no court ruling directly tied to the program’s constitutionality. No DACA decision DACA is a policy, not a law, and is based on a June 2012 memorandum issued by then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. Her memo outlined prosecutorial discretion to focus resources on removing immigrants who met the department’s priorities while protecting Dreamers from deportation. It does not grant legal immigration status to the approximately 800,000 people approved for DACA, but it does give a temporary reprieve from deportation. Immigration laws were "not designed to be blindly enforced" without considering individual cases and circumstances, Napolitano wrote. "Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language. Indeed, many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially justified here." DACA’s critics say that protecting Dreamers through the executive branch, as Napolitano did, instead of through the legislative process is an overreach of executive power. But the judicial branch hasn’t weighed in on the issue. "There has been no court decision holding that DACA itself is unconstitutional," Anil Kalhan, an associate professor of law at Drexel University, previously told PolitiFact. A lawsuit challenging the program was dismissed for lack of standing, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Kalhan said. "So there was never any adjudication on the merits," he said. Following a lawsuit from Texas and 25 other states, a federal district judge did block an expanded version of DACA and another program that offered a reprieve from deportation, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). An appeals court upheld the ruling, and in 2016 the Supreme Court ruled 4-4 on the case, leaving the lower court’s ruling in place. The DACA expansion and DAPA were not halted based on their constitutionality, however, but rather that the federal government hadn’t met some technical requirements. Those programs were temporarily enjoined by the district court in Texas, Kalhan said, "based on a conclusion that Obama administration should have instituted the policy using notice and comment rule-making, rather than using the more informal guidance document that it issued." A final, binding precedent even on that basis was not set either, since it was only a preliminary injunction and the Supreme Court deadlocked, Kalhan said. "And even then, some aspects of DAPA and the DACA expansion may be different from DACA in relevant ways that bear on legality — it has never been fully established the two programs stand on identical legal footing," Kalhan said. Our ruling Moore said DACA was "a mere memo from the Department of Homeland security under Barack Obama, which violated the laws." The DACA program was part of a 2012 Homeland Security memo that said Dreamers would not be the focus of deportation efforts. It didn’t grant Dreamers legal status and only gave them temporary protection from deportation. While critics have called the guidance executive overreach and argued it is illegal, there has been no court ruling calling the policy unconstitutional. It remained in place until the Trump administration announced its end. Moore may feel DACA violated law, and the program has faced legal challenges, but he can’t make that claim as a definitive statement of fact. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-05163	"Romneycare covers abortion, illegal immigrants and has a public option. Obamacare does not."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/18/facebook-posts/facebook-post-compares-elements-romneycare-obamaca/	The health care debate has landed on the virtual battleground of Facebook, with comparisons being made between President Barack Obama’s 2010 law and the bill that Republican Mitt Romney signed in Massachusetts. A reader asked us to check this graphic that claims "Romneycare covers abortion, illegal immigrants and has a public option. Obamacare does not." We’ve also seen that statement repeated on Twitter. Obamacare, of course, is the familiar name for the Affordable Care Act passed by Congress in 2010 and signed by Obama. It seeks health coverage for every American by requiring most Americans to obtain coverage or face a fine. To help people meet that requirement, it expands Medicaid for the poor, provides subsidies for people of modest means to buy insurance, and sets up fines that have the effect of encouraging large employers to provide insurance for their employees. It also sets up insurance exchanges where individuals and businesses can purchase private insurance. Those elements are also the backbone of the health care reform Romney signed in Massachusetts in 2006. Architects of both plans acknowledge that the Massachusetts law served as the model for the national plan. As for the specific comparisons between the two, we’ll take them one by one. Romneycare vs. Obamacare on abortion PolitiFact looked at the abortion issue when Romney’s Republican primary challengers accused him of enacting taxpayer-funded abortions in Massachusetts. The state law itself does not specify what services are covered and what aren’t. Search the text of it, and "abortion" is nowhere to be found. But because of a 1981 Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts, the cost of abortions must be included in publicly subsidized plans. Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage, and the state-subsidized plans in Massachusetts do, too. That includes coverage for Massachusetts residents enrolled in Medicaid. So it’s true that the plan makes abortion accessible through private insurance plans subsidized by the state. But that’s dictated by a court ruling that long predated Romney’s term as governor. On the federal level, coverage of abortion is a bit more complicated. Here’s how we’ve explained a similar claim: Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided by Medicaid or in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. But the health care exchanges established by the law raised the question of whether private companies should be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do) when operating through the exchanges. And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? What resulted was essentially a compromise. When the exchanges begin operating in 2014, some states will ban all abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on that state’s exchange. Doing so is allowed by a state "opt-out" clause that is part of the health care law. Beyond that, every state must offer at least one plan on its exchange that doesn’t cover abortion. In addition, no private insurer will be forced to cover abortion. Unless a state exercises the opt-out clause, insurers will be allowed to sell policies on the exchanges that include abortion coverage. To allow this, yet still abide by the Hyde Amendment, sponsors of the bill drafted a procedure to differentiate between dollars spent on abortion coverage and dollars spent for everything else. (Anti-abortion advocates have consistently argued that the approach doesn’t offer strong enough protections to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion.) The complex funding mechanisms make the question of whether Obamacare covers abortion a little fuzzy. But clearly the law provides some access to the service. Romneycare vs. Obamacare on illegal immigrants Immigration is another complicated area for the two health care laws. Before the Massachusetts law was enacted, the state had a program on the books called the Uncompensated Care Pool, which dates to the mid-1980s. When Romney’s health law passed, the name changed but the eligibility didn’t, said Brian Rosman, research director for the Massachusetts nonprofit group Health Care for All. Now known as the Health Safety Net, it reimburses hospitals and health care centers that provide care for the poor and uninsured. Who can get the care? We found the answer on the Health Safety Net website: "Am I Eligible? The Health Safety Net (Free Care) is for uninsured or underinsured Massachusetts residents who do not have access to affordable health coverage. People of any income with large medical bills that they cannot pay are also eligible. Your citizenship or immigration status does not affect your eligibility." Said Rosman: "People don’t enroll in the program. They don’t get cards. Their benefits are just through the reimbursement to the health provider." That differs from other benefits outlined in the Massachusetts law, which specifies that only people there legally can receive Medicaid benefits or government subsidies to buy health insurance. The Health Safety Net has no such restriction, although any benefit to illegal immigrants is indirect, since the money reimburses health providers, not individuals. "It’s a state-administered program that essentially shares the cost of financing the care for uninsured and underinsured residents of the state across the whole health care system," said Sarah Iselin, former commissioner of the state agency that administers the Health Safety Net. She pointed out that the 2006 law expanded coverage for people who qualify for programs specifically off limits to illegal residents. The Health Safety Net only applies to people who have been determined to be ineligible for those programs. Similar to the Massachusetts program, Obamacare could benefit illegal immigrants only in a very indirect way. First, what it doesn’t do: The law does not make people who are in the country illegally eligible for health insurance through the exchanges -- in fact it specifically bars them; it doesn’t allow them to get tax credits for purchasing insurance, and it doesn’t allow them to receive Medicaid benefits. What it does do: The law provides grants to community health care centers for construction and expansion. The National Association of Community Health Centers noted in 2010 that such centers "make up the largest national network of primary care providers. Most health center patients have low incomes, are uninsured or publicly insured, and are members of racial/ethnic minority groups." "The community health centers serve anybody who needs health care, and I’m sure that will include undocumented people," said Rosman. The Facebook post said Obamacare doesn’t "cover" illegal immigrants. It’s correct there are no coverage benefits for which undocumented people could be eligible, such as Medicaid or tax credits. The law did provide $11 billion over the first five years for community health centers, which treat people regardless of immigration status. That expands access to care at places where poor, undocumented people would have gone for care prior to the law, but it’s not the same as coverage. Romneycare vs. Obamacare on a public option This part isn’t complicated at all: Neither plan has a public option. In Massachusetts a public option would be a program in which the state is the insurer, and Massachusetts has no such plan. The state oversees the health care exchange, but the plans offered there are all private. The reform law expanded Medicaid in Massachusetts, but that’s a program only for people who cannot afford to purchase insurance. We checked with Rosman on this too. "There’s nothing even close to (a public option)," he said, adding that it was never considered in the debate about the law. Early versions of the national health bill included a public option, with the idea that a government plan might be cheaper than private plans, making insurance available to the very poor. But the public option had many opponents in Congress and did not make it into the final law. All together now The Facebook post boils down complicated pieces of legislation to a few simple points. But its summary is short on accuracy. Here’s what we found: Abortion: Romneycare enables people to purchase plans that include abortion coverage. Obamacare does as well, but it also lets states opt out and lets individuals buy plans that don’t cover the procedure. Illegal immigrants: Romneycare’s Health Safety Net reimburses health providers who care for the poor, regardless of whether they’re in the country legally. Obamacare provides grants to community health centers, which also treat anyone who can’t afford to pay for health care. Neither law provides any form of insurance coverage to undocumented people. Public option: Neither plan has a public option in which the government acts as the insurer. The Facebook post got a few things right but most things wrong, particularly about Romney’s plan. Overall we rate it Mostly False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2012-06-18T08:00:00	2012-04-13	['Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']
pomt-09326	"Cell phone numbers go public this month."	false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/14/ken-legler/rep-ken-legler-said-cell-phone-numbers-will-be-rel/	Fact or fiction: Your cell phone number will soon be released to telemarketing companies and — the kicker — your provider also will charge you for incoming sales calls. That's what state Rep. Ken Legler, R-Pasadena, said this week via his Twitter account. His Monday warning: "Cell phone numbers go public this month." His message linked to a note published on his Facebook page the same day: "REMINDER..... all cell phone numbers are being released to telemarketing companies and you will start to receive sales calls. YOU WILL BE CHARGED FOR THESE CALLS." To prevent this, Legler instructed, people should call "888-382-1222, the number for the National DO NOT CALL list... It blocks your number for five (5) years. You must call from the cell phone number you want to have blocked. You cannot call from a different phone number. HELP OTHERS BY PASSING THIS ON." That breathless alert caught our eye. Yet by the time we looked into Legler's Facebook post, it'd been yanked. Legler told us Tuesday that his campaign "fell victim to urban legend and we put it out there and I take full responsibility... we shouldn't have put it out there." After our inquiry, Legler posted a retraction on his Facebook explaining that a volunteer campaign staff member had received the e-mail warning from "what we considered a reliable source" and "felt it was important to keep the public up to date." Legler explained to us that his aides will post notes like press releases from state agencies on his Facebook and Twitter account while he is responsible for the personal messages on both sites. Brad Tegeler, Legler's chief of staff, said he recognized the e-mail as one that had landed in his inbox in the past, and checked to see it if it was true. When he realized it wasn't, Legler's office pulled the Facebook note down "not more than half a day" later. Meanwhile, Legler's Twitter message remained online for the more than 3,000 people who follow his feed to see as we finished this article. (Nearly 1,100 friends could have seen his Facebook post.) Next, we called the National Do Not Call Registry listed in Legler's note to to check on what happens when individuals phone in. A recording by the Federal Trade Commission, which operates the registry, tells callers that anyone can register their home or cell phone number to permanently stop receiving telemarketing calls. It's not just a five-year reprieve, as Legler's note puts it. This gaffe isn't new; a Google search for the same text as Legler's Facebook entry shows similar incorrect warnings — apparently linked to rumors about a national cell-phone directory — posted on blogs starting in 2004. Mitch Katz, a public affairs specialist at the FTC, said this "rumor has been going around for five years and there have been attempts to (create a cell phone directory) but they've all fallen apart." If a cell phone directory is ever created, Katz said, it's likely to work differently: People would have to opt in to get their number listed. The FTC also has debunked the incorrect message on its Web site, which states: "You may have received an e-mail telling you that your cell phone is about to be assaulted by telemarketing calls as a result of a new cell phone number database; however, that is not the case. FCC regulations prohibit telemarketers from using automated dialers to call cell phone numbers. Automated dialers are standard in the industry, so most telemarketers don’t call consumers on their cell phones without their consent." We rate Legler's yanked statement as False.

pomt-05674	"This (Independent Payment Advisory Board) board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/mar/15/pat-boone/pat-boone-says-ipab-rations-care-pay-wasteful-spen/	Pat Boone is best known for his hits of the 1950s like "Love Letters in the Sand" and "I Almost Lost My Mind." But the song he’s been singing lately about Medicare is turning into a moldy oldie. Granted, Boone doesn’t literally sing in the ads he’s done as national spokesman for the 60 Plus Association, a conservative political group that focuses on older Americans. But he’s got distortions of the 2010 health care law on high rotation. The latest ads feature Boone criticizing prominent Democrats who supported the health care law, including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. Here’s part of Boone’s criticism; it focuses on the law’s Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB: "This IPAB board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending. Your choices could be limited and you may not be able to keep your own doctor. ... Washington politicians, like Bill Nelson, are ignoring the problem, putting their own re-elections first. Call Sen. Nelson. Urge him to support real Medicare reform and protect our seniors." The ad makes several claims, but here, we’re going to specifically fact-check Boone’s claim that the IPAB "can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending." The 2010 health care law created the board in response to criticism that Congress has been unwilling or unable to slow the increasing costs of Medicare, the federal program that pays for seniors’ health care. In years past, growing Medicare spending has been an ongoing concern of the federal government, as well as analysts on the left and the right. Under the health care reform law, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed pre-set targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow that increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendations within a set time, IPAB’s recommendations automatically go into effect. (For a more detailed explanation of how this would work, we recommend this April 2011 report from the independent Kaiser Family Foundation.) We should emphasize here that IPAB recommendations would not apply to any particular individual, but would be across-the-board policy recommendations applied to the entire program. Given Boone’s rhetoric, some people could get the wrong impression that the board would review individual patient treatments and deny care. That’s not the case. Still, the IPAB has become one of the more contentious points of the health care law; even some members of Congress who voted for the overall health care law don’t like the IPAB. Recently, Congress held hearings on repealing the board. The hearings were organized by opponents of the IPAB, but people who testified raised concerns that IPAB’s powers are so limited that it’s only real recourse is to reduce payments for doctors and other health care providers, and that could up putting pressure on patient care. We should note that these concerns are also present under the current system, in which Congress takes a more active role. Boone calls the members of the IPAB "15 unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats." Rather than career government workers, the law says IPAB members shall include people with national recognition for health care expertise, including "different professionals, broad geographic representation, and a balance between urban and rural representatives." (Board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.) On the point of accountability, we’ll just repeat that Congress retains the power to overrule any IPAB recommendations, though there are special rules in place so that the recommendations cannot be filibustered or otherwise delayed. The IPAB has restrictions on what it can recommend in the name of cost savings. It can’t raise rates, drop beneficiaries or ration care. Here’s the exact language from the law itself: "The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1818, 1818A, or 1839, increase Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria." Boone says the IPAB seeks to reduce Medicare spending so the government can spend money on other "wasteful" things. But the IPAB is intended to slow Medicare spending if its growth exceeds pre-defined targets. It’s also capped on how much it can reduce spending: It can recommend measures to bring Medicare within specific cost-savings targets and no more. The board was created to address rapid health care inflation. Both Democrats and Republicans recognize that as a problem. Conservatives have their own plans to limit Medicare costs, primarily by moving Medicare to private insurance companies and giving seniors voucher-like premium support to help buy health coverage. We’ve debunked attacks on their ideas, too. When we asked for back-up for the ad’s claims, a public relations firm for the 60 Plus Association sent us links to generic news coverage that didn’t prove the ad’s claims. We also asked the ad’s target for comment; a spokesman for Nelson made the point that the IPAB claims have been widely debunked. We’ll strike up the band here to play our favorite song: Be very cautious when you hear political ads with scare tactics concerning Medicare. The distortions abound on all sides. Our ruling Boone said, "This IPAB board can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments so Washington can fund more wasteful spending." Actually, the law specifically states that the board cannot ration care. The board doesn’t look at individual patients or deny individual treatments. Instead, it makes system-wide recommendations to rein in the future growth of Medicare spending, and it makes those recommendations within limited parameters. It also was created to stop runaway spending growth within the Medicare program itself, not to divert money to other budget items. We rate Boone’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05051	Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is "the largest recipient of lobbyist money."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/10/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-says-jon-tester-ranked-first-/	A new TV ad shows big Montana skies and a succession of people saying Democratic Sen. Jon Tester isn’t representing the people the way he used to. The ad is from Americans for Prosperity, a pro-free-market group. It released the ad in June. Tester is in a tight race against GOP Rep. Dennis Rehberg -- Tester’s first reelection bid since winning his initial six-year term in 2006. The ad’s narration says, in part, "In the past, (Tester has) made a lot of promises, but when he got to D.C., that all changed." Among the examples provided by the ad is that "he’s the largest recipient of lobbyist money." The ad urges voters to "tell" Tester to "stop supporting President Barack Obama’s interests and start supporting Montana’s." The mention of lobbyist donations caught our attention, since Tester -- a first-term senator with low seniority, no chairmanship and no position in his party’s leadership -- wouldn’t seem to be the most obvious candidate to lead his chamber in lobbyist donations. We checked with Americans for Prosperity, which pointed us to a chart from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for campaign finance information. The chart, labeled "Lobbyists: Top Recipients," shows Tester leading the pack with $348,031. This seemed pretty persuasive, until we spot-checked some of the most influential Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to see whether Tester really outraised them. It turns out he didn’t. For instance, CRP lists Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., as receiving $1,125,051 from lobbyists. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took in $625,190 from lobbyists. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., received $579,963. Tester’s fellow Montana senator -- Max Baucus, who chairs the influential Finance Committee -- received $513,169. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., received $379,730. To clarify matters, we checked with the Center for Responsive Politics. It turns out that the top-20 list that Tester headed only includes donations by registered lobbyists made to candidates’ campaign committees during the 2011-2012 period -- the period in which Tester, and everyone else on that list, is up for reelection. Since donors typically give to campaign committees most heavily during the two-year cycle when a candidate is actually up for reelection, Tester was, in effect, only No. 1 in the chamber when compared to candidates currently running for reelection -- not against the entire Senate. None of the five senators we listed above who have higher totals are up for reelection this year. Consequently, none of them has made it onto the top-20 list for 2011-2012. If you equalize the playing field by looking at a full six-year senatorial term, Tester is no longer No. 1 in lobbyist donations, though because of how the Senate staggers the reelection years of its six-year terms, there’s not a complete ranking of all 100 senators. (In a CRP's all-inclusive list of senators who have served since 1989, Tester barely cracks the top 50 in lobbyist donations. The upper levels of this list include many one-time senators who have been out of office for years, such as Al Gore, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.) Still, it’s somewhat misleading for the ad to say, without further qualification, that Tester is "the largest recipient of lobbyist money" among senators. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity claimed that Tester is "the largest recipient of lobbyist money" in the Senate, and it provided as backup a chart from a credible, independent organization showing Tester topping the list. However, the ad doesn’t clarify an important quirk in how CRP puts together its rankings: The ranking is based only on donations made this election cycle. That makes the ad’s phrasing somewhat misleading, because donations tend to spike during a senator's re-election cycle, and looking just one cycle essentially excludes other senators who have accepted more money than Tester if the comparison had been made on an apples-to-apples basis.

pomt-03402	"Nearly 70 percent of all federal spending will go towards Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid" in fiscal year 2014.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/02/todd-young/rep-todd-young-says-social-security-medicare-medic/	Recently, a reader sent us a letter they received from their local congressman, Indiana Republican Todd Young. The reader was surprised at one of the claims. It said "nearly 70 percent of all federal spending will go towards Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid" in fiscal year 2014. The reader wondered whether that was true, and so did we. So we turned to the most recent budgetary estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. If you add together the costs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid for fiscal year 2014, and then subtract the offsetting receipts for those programs, you come up with 45 percent of all federal spending. That’s far lower than "nearly 70 percent." However, if you broaden the definition to include all forms of mandatory spending (or "entitlements") rather than just Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the percentage gets larger. These additional entitlements include many different programs: food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, unemployment compensation, the earned income tax credit, child tax credits, child nutrition programs, federal civilian and military retirement payments, and veterans' benefits. Adding together all forms of entitlements gets the share up to 61 percent. And if you add in a separate category of mandatory spending -- net interest on the national debt -- the number rises to 68 percent. That’s very close to 70 percent. When we presented our research to Young’s office, a spokesman acknowledged the error. "You hit the nail on the head," said spokesman Trevor Foughty. "The letter should have referred to all mandatory spending, including interest, with the those programs (Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid) being the most recognizable. We will make sure to update the letter with more clarity." Our ruling Young’s letter said that "nearly 70 percent of all federal spending will go towards Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid" in fiscal year 2014, and that’s not even close -- the real share is 45 percent. Young’s office acknowledged that they should have clarified that they were including all types of entitlements plus net interest, rather than just those three programs. They said they would correct the statement in the future. However, our policy is to rate the original statement, and in this case, we conclude that it is False.

pomt-02514	Says Rep. Renee Ellmers voted for the government shutdown 21 times.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/12/clay-aiken/clay-aiken-says-gop-legislator-voted-21-times-shut/	Even though Clay Aiken has never run for public office before, he’s no stranger to getting a lot of votes. Now, after announcing his run for a U.S. House seat in North Carolina, the Democrat will have to hope supporters are as eager to flock to the polls as they were to text in their American Idol votes a decade ago. It won’t be an easy road to Washington for Aiken, who will face a Democratic primary. In his YouTube campaign kickoff, which Simon Cowell would probably call "pitchy," Aiken criticized his would-be general election opponent, Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C. "The district where I’m running is represented by a congresswoman who I believe went to Washington with good intentions. I’d like to think that people don’t go there with anything else," Aiken said. "When her party leaders told her to vote for the government shutdown, she did. Twenty-one times. Even though she said herself it would be a disaster for the economy." We can’t know what party leaders told her about how to vote. But we wanted to know if Ellmers voted 21 times to shut down the government, as Aiken claimed. Aiken’s office sent us a list of the 21 votes they counted. By contrast, Ellmers’ staff gave us a list of 24 votes she gave "to keep the federal government open." Interestingly, there was significant overlap. How the votes stack up We combed through congressional votes during the fall of 2013 and came up with our own list of 26 votes in the battle over funding President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, and how it related to the government shutdown. To be clear, there was never a measure that was a straight up-or-down vote to dirctly shut down the government. Rather, it was a series of votes on measures that the House supported but that the Senate and President Obama opposed, that had the predictable effect of shutting down the government. In the House, Republicans controlled which measures get brought to the floor for a vote. Here’s a breakdown of House votes from that time period: Pre-shutdown, votes 478, 497, 498 and 504: These votes took place on the budget in late September and were in support of the House Republican budget, which fully funded the government but defunded Obamacare or delayed its individual mandate. While Ellmers’ votes were in favor of GOP budget proposals, they were made knowing that Obama had said he would veto the legislation if it hit his desk, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown. Rule changes, vote 505: In the early hours of Oct. 1, as the shutdown began, House Republicans voted to alter the rules to make it impossible for an individual legislator to force a vote on reopening the government. Piecemeal appropriations during shutdown, votes 506, 507, 508, 510, 513, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 528, 530, 532, 537, 540, 542, 544 and 548: Ellmers and Republicans voted in favor of these measures during the shutdown to fund different parts of the government individually. That included everything from re-opening federal museums to funding Head Start to funding cancer research. This was a tactical move on both sides of the aisle. Most Democrats opposed these measures in order to continue their push to fund the government in its entirety. Meanwhile, the Republicans used these votes as leverage against the Democrats, saying the Democrats refused to fund a laundry list of federal programs. Forming a working group, vote 534: Mid-shutdown, Ellmers and other House Republicans voted to form a bipartisan working group of senators and representatives to work out economic policy differences and reopen the government. But party leaders made it clear they didn’t want to compromise on a delay of Obamacare’s individual mandate, which was a sticking point for the Democrats. Ending the shutdown, vote 550: Ellmers voted against this, along with a majority of House Republicans. It passed with support from Democrats and a block of 87 Republicans, including Speaker of the House John Boehner. Once Obama signed off on it Oct. 17, this bill ended the shutdown and funded the government through Jan. 15 in place of an annual budget. Ellmers’ record By pointing out how Ellmers and other House Republicans voted in September and October, we’re not trying to absolve the Democrats of any responsibility for the government shutdown. To be sure, both parties shoulder responsibility for building up partisan gridlock. Here, though, we wanted to take a close look at how Ellmers voted during the shutdown. Her record shows she voted with other Republicans to take a hard line on withholding funding for the health care law, even to the point of shutting down the government, and she also voted against the final deal that re-opened the government. Her remarks on the subject contradict those votes. Back in August, she said the shutdown wasn’t the right strategy. After it ended, she said, "I’m happy we are out of the government shutdown," even though she didn’t vote in favor of ending it. It’s also worth noting that Republicans have maintained that their votes for piecemeal appropriations are easily framed as votes to fund the government. Our ruling Aiken said Ellmers "voted for the government shutdown" 21 times. After reviewing the legislation, we found 26 votes from before and during the shutdown that were related. Ellmers consistently voted with Republicans, who wanted to defund Obamacare even at the cost of not funding other government functions. But not all of the votes contributed directly to a shutdown, and Aiken's 21-vote tally is inflated. The bulk of these votes are piecemeal appropriations votes, which were tactical maneuvers by Republicans to try to restart the more popular government functions without funding the health care law. Overall, Aiken has a point that Ellmers repeatedly voted with those who took positions against compromise. Most significantly, she voted for budget measures that precipitated a shutdown and also against the final compromise measure that re-started the federal government. But to say she voted 21 times for a shutdown is an exaggerated number. So we rate Aiken’s claim Half True.	None	Clay Aiken	None	None	None	2014-02-12T11:18:08	2014-02-05	['None']
pomt-02884	Finance experts estimate that paying in cash for the $2.5 billion in projects funded by the sales tax saved Gwinnett County more than $1 billion in interest payments.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/11/charlotte-nash/gwinnett-chairwomans-splost-savings-claim-makes-se/	The election results are in, but we still had a question concerning a particular item on the ballot in Georgia’s second-largest county that seemed worthy for a fact check. Gwinnett County officials had an interesting sales pitch to voters about the merits of continuing a 1 percent special purpose local option sales tax to pay for various projects. It would cost the county more money if they had to borrow the cash instead of collecting it in sales taxes. How much more? One billion dollars. Here’s a passage about it from an interview with Gwinnett Commission Chairwoman Charlotte Nash in the Gwinnett Daily Post: "SPLOST is the best tool that the Legislature has ever given local government," Nash said, adding that finance experts estimate that paying in cash for the $2.5 billion in projects funded by the sales tax saved the county more than $1 billion in interest payments that would have been owed if debt had been issued. "It allowed us to work on those quality of life things, and we were able to do it without debt." PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Gwinnett would have spent $1 billion in interest payments had the county borrowed the money for the projects as opposed to collecting revenue from the sales tax. Gwinnett voters passed the county’s first SPLOST program in June 1985. They’ve approved SPLOST referendums in 1987, 1991, 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008. Since 1985, Gwinnett officials say they’ve collected about $2.5 billion in SPLOST revenue. On Nov. 5, Gwinnett voters approved the latest SPLOST referendum by a 58-42 percent margin. The sales tax would raise $498 million over the next three years. More than two-thirds of the money will be spent on roads, bridges, drainage, sidewalks, intersection improvements and other transportation projects. The county’s 16 cities will collect about $100 million. The rest will be spent on public safety equipment; parks; library and senior citizen facilities; water and sewer improvements; and parking. Gwinnett officials told PolitiFact Georgia they calculated the potential interest rates by using a municipal index scale for counties with AAA bond ratings. Gwinnett gave us the average interest rates for a 20-year deal originated at the beginning of the year for each time period. The interest rates ranged from 8.9 percent in 1985 and gradually declined to 3.85 percent for the SPLOST passed in 2004. The interest rate for the SPLOST referendum passed in 2008 was not included in the county’s calculations. Several experts we spoke with said the county’s methodology appeared sound. "In order for the county to have accomplished the capital outlay projects funded by the SPLOSTs, it would have either had to impose massive property tax increases to fund the projects or borrow money to finance the projects. Borrowing money to finance the projects would have been less painful for the property taxpayers than imposing millage rate increases to fund the projects, because debt can be paid off over 20-30 years," said Earle Taylor III, who has spent about three decades working on public financing projects and is a partner at the law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge. Ray Hill, who teaches managerial economics and finance at Emory University, said the county’s claim is based on the assumption that Gwinnett would have borrowed that much money. Hill and Taylor didn’t see any glaring holes in the county’s calculations. "If the assumption was that, in any event, the county was going to spend an amount of money equal to the SPLOST revenues, it would be easy to get to an interest ‘saving’ figure of $1 billion," said Hill, who is an expert in financing large projects. "The potential interest rates look reasonable. If you assumed they issued a 20-year bond at the amounts listed, you could easily get interest payments that total $1 billion." To sum up, Nash said Gwinnett County would have spent $1 billion in interest payments had the county borrowed the money for the projects as opposed to collecting revenue from the sales tax. Experts we interviewed agreed with the county’s methodology and math. We did our own calculations, and it appeared to us that they would have paid more than $1 billion in interest had they borrowed $2.5 billion. We rate Nash’s claim as True.

pomt-02536	The cost of the food stamp program is at an all-time high.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/07/facebook-posts/spending-all-time-high/	Could Congress be on a roll? It has passed two major spending bills in recent months, most recently the so-called farm bill. Many conservatives were rejoicing that the federal crop subsidy program contained cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as the food stamp program. Too much money is being spent on that program, they argued. "The cost of the food stamp program is at an all-time high," we saw on the Facebook pages of some conservatives. One person had a chart showing the annual totals. The highest number was for the 12-month fiscal year period that ended Sept. 30, at nearly $80 billion. We wondered if this chart is correct and about the claim that spending for the program is at an all-time high. SNAP is administered by the federal Agriculture Department. Recipients must meet various income eligibility requirements to join the program. In Georgia, the state’s Human Services Department helps determine whether someone is eligible to get assistance. An estimated 2 million Georgians were receiving SNAP assistance at some point last year, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. More than 47 million Americans -- nearly one in seven men, women and children -- receive assistance from the program. Congress cut food stamp spending by $8.6 billion over the next 10 years. President Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill Friday. The U.S. Agriculture Department keeps data on annual SNAP spending on its website. SNAP spending has risen in recent years like fly balls used to do on summer nights in the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. In fiscal year 2008, the SNAP spending totaled about $53.6 billion. Five years later, it was $79.64 billion. The fiscal year 2013 total of approximately $80 billion was the highest annual total since the program started in 1969. Adjusted for inflation, the 2013 total is higher than any other fiscal year. Once you adjusted for inflation, the prior fiscal year came the closest to 2013, at $79.59 billion. SNAP spending, adjusted for inflation, has increased all but one fiscal year since 2000. The only fiscal year there was not an increase was 2007. We also decided to check whether the amount of money spent per recipient was at its zenith. Close, but not the highest, we found. The department’s chart shows the monthly allotment for each person in a household receiving benefits was at its highest in fiscal year 2011, at $133.85. The 2013 fiscal year total was $133.07. Federal officials said that SNAP spending and the number of recipients are designed to expand during periods of economic upheaval. The Agriculture Department noted in a statement that the number of recipients declined by 500,000 between June and September 2013. The department expects the number of recipients to continue to decrease as the economy improves. Perhaps. Back to the claim we were trying to check. Some Facebook users are posting claims that the cost of the food stamp program is at an all-time high. Indeed, the most recent total fiscal year budget has never been higher. Spending per recipient was slightly higher a couple of years ago. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-02-07T00:00:00	2014-01-29	['None']
pomt-07397	"We just fought a Republican budget that ends Medicare as we know it."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/01/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-he-fought-republican-budget-ends-me/	Nearly six months after being elected to Congress, David Cicilline is running hard for reelection. On WPRI's "Newsmakers" program, which aired April 24, the freshman congressman was asked about a potential opponent. Cicilline immediately switched to one of his talking points. "The election is two years away. What voters are going to focus on is who's in Washington fighting and standing up for them. We're in the middle of a big battle about what this country is going to be like in terms of our priorities and our values. We just fought a Republican budget that ends Medicare as we know it." The claim that Republicans want to end the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older is being widely used by Democrats as they attack Republican proposals to cut the budget. Cicilline has raised the theme repeatedly in recent new releases, YouTube videos and speeches on the floor of the House. He’s also launched a series of visits to senior citizen to discuss "the effects of the Republican budget on Medicare and Medicaid." PolitiFact National addressed one element of the controversy April 20 when it gave a Pants On Fire ruling to the assertion by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee that "Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare." (Details on that ruling can be found at PolitiFact.com.) A few points are relevant to Cicilline's assertion. First, there is no Republican budget. At issue is a budget resolution proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, who proposes eventually replacing Medicare with subsidies that older people would use to "buy" private insurance, although the elderly would never see the money -- it would be paid by the government to insurance companies. The resolution was approved by 235 of the 240 Republicans in the House. Every Democrat, including Cicilline, voted no. It has no chance in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats. Such resolutions are, as PolitiFact National noted, nonbinding documents that state policy preferences and cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law. Second, the GOP proposal does not "end Medicare as we know it." It wouldn't even begin to change Medicare as we know it for another 12 years. Under the Republican plan, developed because the GOP and other critics regard the costs of the current program as unsustainable, Medicare would continue in its present form for people who already receive it. In addition, those 55 or older would be covered by the program once they hit their 65th birthday. So even 12 years from now, part of today's Medicare would remain in place until every recipient covered under the existing rules has died. The claim would be true for younger people, because the version of Medicare they would see when they retire would be very different. For example, they would have to buy health plans from private insurance companies, with financial assistance and regulation from the government -- akin in some ways to President Obama’s health-care plan that so many Republicans object to. In addition, the eligibility age would gradually rise to 67. In short, Cicilline, has pushed back against the Republican proposal to change Medicare. But he has mischaracterized a nonbinding budget resolution as a budget. More significantly, he exaggerated the impact of a Republican Medicare proposal to imply that everyone would be affected, while the GOP resolution specifically exempts existing beneficiaries and future beneficiaries who are currently 55 and over. If he had added those qualifiers, his statement would have been closer to accurate. But he didn’t. We rate his statement Barely True. (To comment or offer your own ruling, visit us on Facebook.) Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04978	"I used my line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year ... is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/23/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-cut-361-million-state-leg/	Gov. Chris Christie sliced spending from the state budget, but the cuts are not as deep as he claimed recently. In a speech at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank in Washington, D.C., Christie said he recently signed his third budget, which he said increased spending on education, while bolstering support for the state’s most vulnerable citizens and making a "significant down payment on our pension obligation." "At the same time, I used my line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year, in fiscal year 2013, which has just begun, is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor, Governor Corzine," Christie said during the July 9 address. In fact, Christie sliced about $86 million -- not $360 million -- from the state budget using line-item vetoes, a process that allows the governor to eliminate or reduce particular appropriations in the budget. Reductions in funds for pension contributions made up a large portion of the cuts. Christie also reduced funding for transitional aid to towns, nursing homes and medical day care services, among other areas. So Christie is wrong on the size of the cuts. He’s also wrong to claim those cuts had an impact on trimming the spending plan to below the size of the 2008 and 2009 budgets. The Legislature had passed and delivered a budget to Christie that was already smaller than those two budget bills. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for clarification on how Christie reached his total of $360 million in cuts, but his office has cited the figure before. A news release from June 29 -- the day Christie signed the budget -- said that the governor "put Corzine Democrats on their heels by vetoing $361 million in unnecessary or unsupported spending." Attached to that release were several vetoes of other bills the Legislature sent to the governor’s desk. Christie claims in his veto messages that seven of those bills would have increased government spending by more than $275 million. Adding that amount to the line-item vetoes pushes Christie’s total cuts to more than $361 million. Christie says in the veto documents that separating the bills from the budget is "little more than a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the tough choices required to meet the constitutional obligation of passing a balanced budget." "Taken together," Christie claims the bills "would add more than $275 million of government spending for the coming fiscal year." Several of the bills clearly authorize additional appropriations, such as a bill that increased the amount of aid municipalities receive from the Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Fund, starting with a $66 million bump in fiscal year 2013. But others don’t. One bill Christie vetoed would have provided towns more time to spend affordable housing funds before turning the money over to the state. And other bills, like a piece of legislation that would have required municipalities to submit economic growth plans to keep participating in the state’s urban enterprise zone program, lacked a firm estimate of potential fiscal impact. Still, all of the bills were vetoed outright by the governor and were not part of the state budget he signed. Christie used his line-item veto authority to cut more than $86 million -- not $360 million -- from the Legislature’s budget. Our ruling Christie said he used his "line-item veto authority to veto $360 million dollars in special interest spending, so that our budget this year ... is still smaller than the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 budgets signed by my predecessor." Only one fourth of that figure -- about $86 million -- represents appropriations in the budget reduced by Christie’s line-item veto. And Christie’s point that those cuts reduced the size of the budget to below 2008 and 2009 levels is wrong. The budget the Legislature passed was already smaller than those two budgets.

pomt-12146	Says Scott Walker "has taken money away from internet expansion in our state."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/10/andy-gronik/testing-democratic-challenger-claim-scott-walker-t/	In statewide elections, Democrats tend to rely on an urban base. But in a July 14, 2017, interview on WisconsinEye, gubernatorial hopeful Andy Gronik criticized Gov. Scott Walker for a lack of progress in plans for rural development in the state. "To suggest to our rural areas in Wisconsin that Governor Walker has a real plan and that he really cares about economic development in those areas -- come on," Gronik said, later adding: "The fact that Governor Walker has taken money away from internet expansion around our state is ludicrous." The notion that Walker has taken money from internet expansion comes from a controversial move in 2011, when state officials returned nearly $23 million in federal stimulus money from the National Telecommunications & Information Administration. The grant would have "boosted broadband connections in 380 Wisconsin communities, including 385 libraries and 82 schools," the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in 2011. The Gronik campaign cited the piece as its initial backing for the statement. But is Gronik’s claim accurate today? We took a look at the circumstances of 2011 -- and at what's happened since. The 2011 picture The $23 million grant was returned a year after it was awarded. The money was provided through the federal Broadband Technology Opportunities Program, which aimed to expand broadband access to underserved rural areas across the country. Walker’s decision was a source of disappointment for school and library associations, and viewed with skepticism by Democrats such as Mark Pocan, then a state lawmaker, who argued the decision was in the interest of Walker’s "big telecommunications campaign donors." AT&T employees and the company’s political action committee donated more than $20,000 to Walker’s 2010 campaign. AT&T contracts with the state to manage and maintain the infrastructure that forms the BadgerNet Converged Network, the public network that was to receive the federal funds. Ironically, that public/private partnership made it difficult for the state to meet the grant requirements. And giving back the money was something many agreed with at the time. "After months of negotiations that spanned administrations, it was clear the unique nature of Wisconsin’s Badger Network was not compatible with the technical requirements of the NTIA," said David Cagigal, chief information officer of the state’s Department of Enterprise Technology in a statement to Politifact Wisconsin. "In fact, the Badger Network we have in the state was able to accomplish the same goals of the NTIA funding by 2014." Barry Orton, a retired University of Wisconsin-Madison telecommunications policy professor, said the public/private partnership made meeting federal requirements difficult. "Other states and the feds said, ‘Well, this money shouldn’t go right to the carriers, it should go to local governments, to non-profits, to co-ops. We want to see that the money is spent for actual new broadband rather than increasing the capital budgets of existing carriers,’ " he said. Others noted taking the grant without meeting the requirements would have left Wisconsin taxpayers with a $23 million bill. Tony Varda, who has spent 11 years as the chair of the board for the Town of Berry, still supports the decision, despite his town’s need for better broadband connections. "You gotta think about it a little before you look the gift horse in the mouth," he said. "But when we looked in the mouth here, it wasn’t pretty." So, Walker clearly turned back money for internet expansion -- but the picture is much more blurry, as the state’s existing set-up created complications in accepting it. The picture since Since 2011, the state’s efforts to expand internet access -- especially rural areas -- have grown. In an analysis of NTIA and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) data, the Public Service Commission (PSC) of Wisconsin and the state-level Wisconsin Broadband Office found coverage expansion in "practically every county," including 20,000 households with improved connections. Over the last five years, the PSC gave out $5.5 million in grant funding to underserved areas of the state. In Walker’s current two-year budget request, he asked lawmakers to approve $15 million in grant money. He also requested more than $25 million for the TEACH program, which provides infrastructure and teacher training grants for schools. Though the budget is stalled before the Legislature, the outlook for including the internet money is promising, said Elise Nelson, spokeswoman for the PSC. Those who work with public schools and libraries said things are on the upswing. "Schools are in a much better position now," said Dan Rossmiller, director of government relations at the Wisconsin Association of School Boards. "They have much better bandwidth at much lower cost than they did then." Nevertheless, the internet challenges in rural Wisconsin are far from solved. Walker’s $15 million request over two years is less than the $20 million allocated this year alone in Minnesota’s development grant program, Border to Border. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission monitors the percentage of people who lack broadband connectivity each year in 56 states and territories. The 2016 average for the 50 states and Washington, D.C., was 13% -- the same as the portion of Wisconsinites who lack coverage. In rural areas, the national number jumps to 38%. Wisconsin comes in at 43%, roughly equal with Minnesota. Our rating Gronik says Scott Walker "has taken money away from internet expansion in our state." In 2011, Walker’s first year in office, the state returned $23 million to the federal government -- though the decision is not as simple as Gronik portrays it. Since then, Walker’s office has increased funding for broadband development grants. Price tags aside, the data available on rural coverage put the state’s reach on par with Minnesota -- which spent tens of millions more in the same time frame -- and in the middle of the pack of neighbors Illinois, Iowa and Michigan.

pomt-06803	"President Obama and Democrats' spending addiction has driven our national debt to historic proportions, maxed out our national credit card and has now led to the Democrat Downgrade of our country's AAA credit rating."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/12/kevin-dewine/ohio-gop-chairman-kevin-dewine-blames-democrats-dr/	Even before financial markets had a chance to react, the blame game started over Standard and Poor's decision to lower the credit rating of the United States government from AAA status to AA-plus. The Obama administration reacted to the downgrade with indignation, finding flaws in S&P's calculations and analysis. Democrats and Republicans began finger-pointing that was not limited to Washington. Ohio Republican Party Chairman Kevin DeWine issued a statement blaming Obama for what he called a "Democrat downgrade." "President Obama and Democrats' spending addiction has driven our national debt to historic proportions, maxed out our national credit card and has now led to the Democrat Downgrade of our country's AAA credit rating," he said. PolitiFact has repeatedly checked statements in recent months about "maxing out the U.S. credit card," and found significant exaggeration. Although Democrats shoulder a fair amount of blame for the nation's fiscal woes, so do Republicans because they voted for tax cuts and additional spending that also contributed to the large deficits. What is new in DeWine's statement is what attracted our attention: the label of "Democrat downgrade" on S&P's rating. We asked the Ohio GOP how it backed up the claim, and it cited about two dozen sources. One was a PolitiFact story that referred to Obama as "the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents." (Which, the story went on to say, "goes to show that statistics can be used -- and misused -- to bolster almost any argument.") The other sources, mostly commentaries, fault Obama's leadership on the economy, tie Democrats to spending or speculate on the political damage to Obama and Democrats from the downgrade. One citation is a story from Politico saying that Obama "is now firmly part of the landscape that S&P trashed" -- after the story says he was "dragged by Hill Republicans into the endless fiscal and personal nightmare that was the debt ceiling debate." We think the best way to determine what's in the S&P report is to read it. It's available to anyone online. "We lowered our long-term rating on the U.S.," the report says, "because we believe that the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate indicate that further near-term progress containing the growth in public spending, especially on entitlements, or on reaching an agreement on raising revenues is less likely than we previously assumed and will remain a contentious and fitful process." In other words -- though S&P says it "takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures" that would put the country's finances on more stable footing -- the firm looked for spending to be better contained and for revenues to increase. New revenues might have helped head off a downgrade, but "the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues," the report says. S&P faults "the political brinksmanship of recent months" for making America's governance and policymaking "less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed." The firm complains that the statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default "have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy" and that "the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge." In our reading -- and in the words of the very Politico story that the GOP cites as a source -- "S&P suggested that the Democrats are just as much a part of the problem as the Republicans." We repeat: Just as much. Democrats and Republicans both. That means the one-sided label of "Democrat downgrade" has some element of truth -- but it ignores so much critical information that it gets a Truth-O-Meter rating of Mostly False.

pomt-01936	"Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/25/republican-party-florida/cost-prepaid-college-tuition-nosedived-under-scott/	Students, teachers and a mom praise Gov. Rick Scott’s record on higher education and bash that of Democratic front-runner Charlie Crist in a new TV ad released June 17, 2014, from the Republican Party of Florida. "You know college has become so expensive. Gov. Crist was a governor that was not looking out for Florida. Tuition skyrocketed. You know Charlie Crist made college cost more. Charlie Crist did not make education a priority," states the ad, as a 2009 Tampa Bay Times headline flashes on the screen citing a tuition increase of up to 15 percent. "Rick Scott has put a lot of money back into education," the ad continues. "Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000. A lot of my students now see hope. Rick Scott has made college more affordable." We previously fact-checked a claim by Scott that Crist "allowed college tuition to increase up to 15 percent every year" and rated that Mostly True. (And we have fact-checked other claims in the race about higher education cuts.) Here we will fact-check the Republicans’ claim that Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000. Florida prepaid college tuition program The Florida Legislature created the Stanley G. Tate Prepaid College Program in 1987. Here’s how it works: Families set up an advanced payment contract, typically paying a monthly fee. That allows families to lock in many of the costs associated with college and apply it when their child heads off to college. For example, someone who purchased a contract earlier this year for a newborn would lock in to pay $350 a month, which would generate enough money to cover college when their child enrolls in 2032. (Parents can also sign up children in later years, too, though that increases the monthly cost.) While the plans are designed to cover tuition at Florida schools and universities, the money can be applied to schools in other states. We should note that setting aside the money isn’t a guarantee that a child will get into college; they still have to apply and be accepted. About 80 percent of families choose the monthly option which includes interest so it adds up to paying more over 18 years than those who pay the lump sum up front. (It operates much like a mortgage -- homeowners pay less over the term of a mortgage if they pay it more quickly.) More than 1.6 million prepaid plans have been purchased and nearly 350,000 students have attended college using these plans. The program is popular, but the amount for new plans skyrocketed in 2008 and again in 2010 -- for example the lump sum payment rose from about $22,000 in 2009 to $40,000 in 2010. The hikes were as a result of the Legislature approving the "tuition differential" that allowed universities to tack on an extra increase in tuition up to 15 percent. (First the hike was reserved for University of Florida and Florida State University, but later additional universities were added.) The prepaid college board assumed that universities would use that maximum amount, sending the costs into an upward spiral. This year, the Legislature passed House Bill 851, which will cause the prepaid program to drop in cost starting with the enrollment period that begins Oct. 15. The bill lowers tuition costs because it: • eliminates automatic annual rate-of-inflation increase for all universities; • gets rid of tuition differential for all but two universities (UF and FSU); • for UF and FSU, the tuition differential drops from an annual maximum of 15 percent to 6 percent. The bill passed the House 84-32 and the Senate 26-13 and Scott signed it June 9. (The bill also established in-state tuition for certain illegal immigrants who arrived here as children.) For the prepaid plans, the price of the four-year university plan would be reduced by "at least $10,000" for future participants, according to a House staff analysis of the bill. Additionally, thousands of families already participating in prepaid plans will get refunds or reductions, depending on the plan. The Florida Prepaid College Board cites an even bigger savings on its website: the lump sum price of the Four-Year Florida University Plan for newborns is anticipated to drop nearly $20,000 from its current price of $54,000 to $35,000 or less. For those who choose the monthly payments for the same plan, the board anticipates the monthly payments will drop at least $100, from $350 to $250 or less. Over the life of a plan, that could add up to about $22,000 less than before the Legislature passed this bill, a spokeswoman for the prepaid board told PolitiFact Florida. More precise figures under both scenarios will emerge in September when the board sets costs for the new enrollment period. We asked Ryan Duffy, a spokesman for Florida House speaker Will Weatherford, why the House staff analysis cited a savings of "at least $10,000" while the prepaid board said savings would add up to "nearly $20,000." The $10,000 figure was a conservative estimate provided by the prepaid college board in February based on an earlier version of the bill, Duffy said. That lower figure did not include the changes to tuition differential. Our ruling A TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida stated "Gov. Rick Scott cut the cost of prepaid college tuition by nearly $20,000." That figure comes from a projection by the prepaid college tuition board which anticipates that a newborn’s lump-sum plan will decline by that amount. An earlier analysis of the bill placed a more conservative estimate of "at least $10,000" but that did not fully reflect the changes approved by the Legislature to lower the costs. The main caveat here is that Scott doesn’t get full credit: the Legislature signed off on the bill, too. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01577	The United States has "the most number of deductions available to corporations" for the corporate income tax.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/bob-beckel/does-us-have-more-corporate-tax-deductions-any-oth/	America’s tax code is so famously byzantine that it’s difficult to even measure how riddled it is with loopholes. But Fox News’ Bob Beckel took a shot at doing this on The Five, during a discussion of corporate taxes with co-host Eric Bolling. "We have a high corporate tax rate," said Beckel, but "we also have the most number of deductions available to corporations. They pay lower taxes than an awful lot of European countries do." Bolling countered that the United States has "the highest corporate tax rate in the free world," which he said is why companies like Pfizer and Burger King "jumped ship" by relocating their corporate headquarters outside of the United States. Beckel, however, stuck to his guns, repeating that the United States has "the highest number of deductions" and adding that companies leave the United States for cheap labor, not to evade taxes. We checked Bolling’s claim separately. In this check, we will look at whether Beckel is correct that the U.S. tax code has the highest number of deductions. The uncountable The bad news for Beckel: Experts told us it’s neither practical nor useful to tally the number of deductions in the tax code, and that they hadn’t seen any study that tried. PolitiFact, our sister site, checked a claim in 2013 that "there have been literally hundreds of new tax preferences and loopholes added to the code since 1986." Based on the best estimates available, we ruled that True, but that’s a much more limited claim than the one Beckel made. Deductions constitute a broader category of tax provisions, making Beckel’s claim even harder to check. "Some Internal Revenue code sections might have 10 or more deductions" by themselves, said David Kautter, managing director of the Kogod Tax Center at American University. The Treasury Department has issued estimates of the number of "tax expenditures," but those are only a "subset of tax deductions," said Kautter. "Many deductions are not tax expenditures," such as "wages, office rent, pencils, writing pads, etc." Since tax experts can’t even really count the number of deductions in the United States, an international comparison is more or less impossible. In any case, experts told us that the more relevant figure is the size of deductions. Governments use what’s called a statutory rate -- 39.1 percent in the United States, the highest in the developed world -- which is levied on the businesses’ taxable base. The taxable base starts out as the corporation’s profits, but the tax code allows them to deduct certain expenditures from that base, like wages, health insurance, and investments in infrastructure. Once you account for deductions, the actual proportion of their profits that businesses fork over to the government is a lot lower. This is called the effective rate. Experts suggested we determine the difference between countries’ effective rates and their statutory rates as a way of measuring the scope of deductions. If the United States were to lead in that measure, then Beckel might have had a point, even if his literal claim didn’t hold water. Sizing up deductions Even this is difficult, experts say. William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, noted that credits and exemptions also help shape the effective rate, so the simple difference between effective and statutory rates can’t be chalked up to tax deductions alone. Still, since we figured that Beckel cared more about the difference between effective and statutory rates than about distinguishing between deductions and exemptions, we ran the numbers anyway, using the World Bank’s estimates for countries’ 2014 effective rates and the Tax Foundation’s tabulations of their statutory rates. Those figures showed that the United States has an effective rate of 27.9 percent, meaning the gap was 11.2 points. That difference ranked 16th out of the 34 advanced, industrialized nations that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Iceland had the widest ratio between its statutory and effective rates (20 percent versus 3 percent), while Belgium had the largest percentage-point drop (from 34 percent to 6.4 percent). In both difference and ratio, the United States was roughly in the middle of the pack. Our ruling Beckel said the United States has "the highest number of deductions available to corporations." Counting and comparing deductions internationally isn’t practical, and the only plausible alternative -- estimating the gap between the nations’ statutory and effective tax rates -- shows that the gap in the United States is about average among advanced, industrialized countries. We rate Beckel’s claim False.	None	Bob Beckel	None	None	None	2014-09-09T11:01:31	2014-09-01	['United_States']
pomt-09227	"She (Kagan) took money from Goldman Sachs just like her boss, Obama."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/14/michael-savage/michael-savage-says-kagan-took-money-goldman-sachs/	Never once to mince words, radio talk show host Michael Savage offered a blistering assessment of Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan on the conservative World Net Daily website. Savage said one of the knocks on Kagan is that she was paid by Goldman Sachs, the investment bank under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud related to its dealings in the subprime mortgage market. "She took money from Goldman Sachs just like her boss, Obama," Savage wrote. According to a Judiciary Committee questionnaire Kagan filled out when she was tapped by President Barack Obama to be solicitor general in 2009, Kagan was a member of the advisory council for the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She served on the panel from 2005 to 2008 while she was dean at Harvard Law School. And in 2008, according to financial disclosure forms filed with the Senate committee, she was paid a stipend of $10,000 for her services. According to its website, the Global Markets Institute at Goldman Sachs "provides research and high-level advisory services to policymakers, regulators and investors around the world." Kagan participated for several years in an annual, daylong conference for the company. "This advisory group was comprised of leaders from various sectors including academia, the media, business, and other industry," Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler told media outlets that inquired about Kagan's role with the board. "They met once a year for a daylong conference organized around public policy matters. The group was not involved in making any investment decisions for the company." Asked about Kagan's involvement with Goldman Sachs on the day before her nomination, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the panel "had absolutely nothing to do with decisions Goldman is being investigated for." The Huffington Post posted two reports the advisory council completed in 2005 and 2008. Among other things, they assess various risks faced by the world economy (and as the HuffPo article notes, they weren't exactly prescient). While it certainly doesn't do any political good to be associated in any way with Goldman Sachs right now, we could find no evidence that Kagan's role is tied to any alleged wrongdoing at Goldman Sachs. We also think it's a stretch for some critics to embellish her limited one-day-a-year position into a broad characterization that she "worked for" Goldman Sachs. But that's not what Savage said. He said Kagan took money from Goldman Sachs, and she did -- at least $10,000 in 2008. The second part of Savage's claim -- the "just like her boss, Obama" part -- is a bit of a stretch, though. Obama has never drawn a paycheck from Goldman Sachs and federal law prohibits corporations from making direct campaign contributions. So neither Obama nor his campaign got any money from Goldman Sachs, the corporate entity. And during the presidential election, his campaign didn't accept money from federal political action committees. But he did accept considerable campaign contributions from Goldman Sachs employees. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a well-respected nonpartisan group that specializes in analyzing campaign data, Goldman Sachs employees gave the Obama campaign $994,795. That put Goldman Sachs employees No. 2 on Obama's top donors list. But again, getting a check from Goldman Sachs for services rendered (as Kagan did, albeit a small one) is far different than accepting campaign contributions from the company's employees. By that measure, Obama's Republican opponent Sen. John McCain took money from Goldman Sachs too -- $230,000 in campaign contributions from its employees. So we find Savage's claim to be Half True.

pomt-10298	On a timetable to withdraw from Iraq.	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/12/barack-obama/obama-sticks-to-his-iraq-plan/	The day before the Fourth of July weekend, Sen. Barack Obama talked about the likelihood that he will soon travel to Iraq and what it means for his foreign policy. "I've always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability. That assessment has not changed," he said. "And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground, I'm sure I'll have more information and will continue to refine my policies." Sen. John McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee pounced on those comments, charging Obama with flip-flopping. "Since announcing his campaign in 2007, the central premise of Barack Obama's candidacy was his commitment to begin withdrawing American troops from Iraq immediately," said Brian Rogers, a McCain spokesman. "Today, Barack Obama reversed that position proving once again that his words do not matter. He has now adopted John McCain's position that we cannot risk the progress we have made in Iraq by beginning to withdraw our troops immediately without concern for conditions on the ground." "There appears to be no issue that Barack Obama is not willing to reverse himself on for the sake of political expedience," said Alex Conant, a spokesman for the national Republican Party. "Obama's Iraq problem undermines the central premise of his candidacy and shows him to be a typical politician." We reviewed Obama's statements on Iraq from the campaign to try to uncover whether he was backtracking on earlier promises. Iraq was one of the most pressing issues of the Democratic primary campaign, discussed and dissected during more than 20 debates. We found that Obama has made a few points about Iraq over and over again: that he opposed the war "from the start"; that U.S. troops should leave Iraq quickly and in an orderly fashion ("as careful getting out as we were careless getting in"); and that the United States should not have permanent bases inside Iraq. How quickly should troops leave? His campaign Web site says: "Obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from Iraq. He will remove one to two combat brigades each month, and have all of our combat brigades out of Iraq within 16 months. Obama will make it clear that we will not build any permanent bases in Iraq. He will keep some troops in Iraq to protect our embassy and diplomats; if al-Qaida attempts to build a base within Iraq, he will keep troops in Iraq or elsewhere in the region to carry out targeted strikes on al-Qaida." The McCain campaign and the RNC have pointed to the "16 months" statement as an indication that Obama favors a "precipitous withdrawal," presumably as early as the middle of 2010. (We checked that claim earlier here and found it Half True.) They also point to a March 2007 statement from Obama campaign manager David Plouffe. "On Iraq, he has been very clear," Plouffe said. "He offered a withdrawal plan well over a year ago. It's essential to his candidacy and a rock-solid commitment. ... It will be 16 months at the most where you can withdraw combat troops." Plouffe's statement appears to be the best evidence to support the McCain campaign's argument. Plouffe was responding to comments from former Obama adviser Samantha Power, who had said the 16-month timeframe was a "best-case scenario" that Obama wouldn't necessarily follow once he was in office. Power was forced to resign after calling Sen. Hillary Clinton a "monster." But does this mean a 16-month clock starts ticking the moment Obama enters office? We could not find a direct statement from Obama saying that, and found statements he made throughout the campaign that contradicted that. For example: • At a Democratic debate in Hanover, N.H., on Sept. 26, 2007, the late Tim Russert pressed Obama as to whether he would have all troops out by the end of his first term. "I think it's hard to project four years from now, and I think it would be irresponsible. We don't know what contingency will be out there," Obama said. "I will drastically reduce our presence there to the mission of protecting our embassy, protecting our civilians and making sure that we're carrying out counterterrorism activities there. I believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013, but I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation's going to be three or four years out." • At a Democratic debate in Cleveland on Feb. 26, 2008, Obama said, "As soon as I take office, I will call in the joint chiefs of staff, we will initiate a phased withdrawal, we will be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in. We will give ample time for them to stand up, to negotiate the kinds of agreements that will arrive at the political accommodations that are needed." • At a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008, Obama said, "Now, I will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics. Once I've given them a new mission, that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of Iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out, we will not have permanent bases there, once I've provided that mission, if they come to me and want to adjust tactics, then I will certainly take their recommendations into consideration; but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief." • On Meet the Press on May 4, 2008, Russert asked Obama what he would do if advisers thought "a quick withdrawal" from Iraq would result in genocide. Obama replied, "Of course, I would factor in the possibilities of genocide, and I factored it in when I said that I would begin a phased withdrawal. What we have talked about is a very deliberate and prudent approach to the withdrawal — one to two brigades per month. At that pace, it would take about 16 months, assuming that George Bush is not going to lower troop levels before the next president takes office. We are talking about, potentially, two years away. At that point, we will have been in Iraq seven years. If we cannot get the Iraqis to stand up in seven years, we're not going to get them to stand up in 14 or 28 or 56 years." Taken in their entirety, Obama's comments reflect a philosophy of "about 16 months" for withdrawal. He also appears to be willing to take advice from commanders on the ground that might affect the general pace, but not the overall goal of withdrawal. Yet Obama has been artful in his rhetoric. His campaign has clearly emphasized "16 months" when speaking to antiwar audiences and " about 16 months" when answering questions from withdrawal skeptics. But Obama never urged a "precipitous" withdrawal; even a bill he offered in January 2007 that set a deadline for getting out of Iraq contained an exemption for national security. The Plouffe statement, however, is troubling. Plouffe said the 16-month time frame was a "rock-solid commitment." But it's the only statement we found that supports the idea of withdrawal with no allowances made for circumstances on the ground, and it appears to be contradicted by the candidate himself. After the McCain campaign attacked Obama as a flip-flopper, the candidate responded with another news conference the same day. "I intend to end this war," Obama said. "My first day in office I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in, and I will give them a new mission. And that is to end this war. Responsibly, deliberately, but decisively. And I have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades per month. And again, that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months' time." Weighing all these statements together, we find that Obama has not flip-flopped on Iraq, but that he has emphasized different aspects of his plan under questioning. This rates a No Flip on the Flip-O-Meter scale.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-12T00:00:00	2008-08-04	['Iraq']
pomt-13544	Says there are "concrete examples" of University of Texas job applicants or prospective applicants and students as well as invited speakers changing their minds because of handguns being allowed in campus buildings and classrooms.	true	/texas/statements/2016/aug/26/lisa-moore/professor-concrete-examples-teachers-students-spur/	A University of Texas English professor says a law enabling Texans with state permits to carry concealed guns into classrooms has already caused prospective faculty, students and even speakers not to come to the Austin campus. Lisa Moore said in an NPR interview aired Aug. 7, 2016, six days after the campus-carry mandate took effect: "We already have concrete examples of faculty who have declined to apply for jobs here at the university or who, once offered jobs, have turned them down when they realized that this policy would go into effect, students changing their minds about coming to our graduate and undergraduate programs, and invited speakers declining to come when they realized that we couldn't guarantee that they would give their talk in a gun-free space." "Concrete examples" is definitive. So, how about details? First it’s worth noting that since 1995, Texas law has allowed any individual with a concealed handgun permit to carry a gun on public college and university sidewalks, streets, parking areas and other grounds. In 2015, state lawmakers widened the law by voting to let permit holders also carry guns in campus buildings, except in areas excluded under rules adopted by each school’s president. UT-Austin President Gregory L. Fenves has written that he doesn’t believe handguns belong in campus buildings; still, he agreed to allow them in classrooms because, he said, barring them would have the effect of generally excluding guns from campus, which the law prohibits. In February 2016, Fenves also wrote Bill McRaven, the UT System chancellor: "Since this is a new law with an unknown effect on UT Austin, we will monitor implementation and its impact on students, faculty members, and staffers. I have significant concerns about how the law will affect our ability to recruit and retain faculty members and students. Fenves is among state defendants, too, in a lawsuit filed by Moore and two fellow professors seeking to bar civilian handguns from campus. On Aug. 22, 2016, a federal judge denied their request for a preliminary injunction that would have allowed them to ban concealed handguns from their classrooms. U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel said he found no precedent for the argument that professors have a right of academic freedom under the First Amendment so broad that it overrides decisions of the Legislature and the university that employs them. Moore, Jennifer Lynn Glass and Mia Carter were still free to pursue the merits of their case. But Yeakel’s ruling was a considerable setback for them, as they wanted to ban guns in time for the start of fall classes. Virginia professor declined UT visit Moore, asked for concrete examples, initially responded with an email reminding that an out-of-state candidate for a UT deanship said he bowed out of consideration in 2015 due to the gun law. A February 2016 Austin American-Statesman news blog post quoted Siva Vaidhyanathan, a University of Virginia professor of media studies who’d previously earned UT bachelor’s and doctoral degrees, saying he’d been contacted by a search firm helping the university find a dean for the Moody College of Communication--and, the story said, was later told he was a finalist. But the gun law weighed on him; the story said that if chosen, Vaidhyanathan said, he’d have felt compelled to side with faculty members seeking to bar guns from classrooms. "I would probably be fired immediately," he said. "I told the search firm I was no longer interested in the position." To our inquiry, Vaidhyanathan provided a December 2015 email he sent to search firm officials declining their invitation to return to the Texas campus for "an extended visit and a dinner" about the deanship that would have included meetings with Fenves and others. Vaidhyanathan’s email said the prospect of guns being allowed in classrooms meant he couldn’t "pursue this position with enthusiasm." Vaidhyanathan wrote: "I could not, in good conscience, ask faculty and students to put themselves into an environment in which students, visitors, or even faculty could be armed. My wife is a scientist. I could not ask her to take a job at a university that was forbidden by law to restrict guns from classrooms. The very consideration of that possibility puts a chilling effect on open and relaxed discourse in the classroom. And the fact that the university cannot restrict guns on campus in general means that university police officers are forbidden to do their jobs effectively. They can’t diffuse a threatening situation until it becomes a dangerous one. "Universities are tense enough already. And we all count on our university police forces to confront and (defuse) threatening situations as early as possible. The State of Texas has put every student and professor in Texas in danger. I applaud the chancellor, the president, the faculty, and the students for their strong opposition to campus carry." So, that’s a candidate for dean confirmed. Next, we followed up with Moore about particular students, other prospective faculty and speakers deciding not to come to UT due to the gun law. A mother’s email Moore forwarded a November 2015 email sent by a parent, Rachel Zucker, to a UT mailbox. The message says: "Dear UT, I want you to know that my son, Moses Goren, is a straight A student at Hunter College High School (in NYC) who has expressed interest in applying to your Plan II program at UT (Austin). He and I have decided, however, that he will not apply to any schools that have campus carry laws. We believe that guns should not be allowed on college campuses and that guns present a serious physical danger for faculty and students. If you were to make UT Austin a safer place by making it illegal to bring a gun on campus, I would eagerly and proudly have Moses apply to your esteemed school. Thank you, Rachel Zucker" To our inquiry, Zucker confirmed her son’s decision. "Both of us feel even clearer about this than we did when wrote that email. The rampant gun violence and lack of commonsense gun control in this country should be a source of unmitigated shame for our leaders and legislators," Zucker said by email, adding that she hopes UT bans guns on campus. Moore also noted the departures of two UT faculty members by 2016. In each instance -- Architecture Dean Frederick Steiner’s move to the University of Pennsylvania and economist Daniel Hamermesh’s shift to opportunities abroad -- news stories and emails we fielded from the men describe the gun law as a factor, though not the only factor, in the departures. Hamermesh urged us to consult Joan Neuberger, a UT history professor, who responded by emailing a prospective graduate student’s February 2016 email saying she would decline UT’s offer of admission "due to my misgivings with the campus carry guidelines President Fenves released today." Nora Dolliver went on: "Although I think that UT would be a wonderful place to complete my graduate training, I am unwilling to study or work in an environment where my classmates, professors, students, or patrons are permitted to carry handguns." Harvard professor’s decision A March 2016 news story in UT’s student newspaper, The Daily Texan, quoted Moore saying a Harvard University professor had withdrawn from a search for a faculty position in the UT Women and Gender Studies department because of the measure letting guns into classrooms. By phone, Moore told us the professor, Robin Bernstein, had been urged by Moore and others to apply in 2015, but Bernstein, citing the gun law, declared she wouldn’t. "She definitely would have been a finalist," Moore said, adding that faculty were ultimately unable to fill the position. By email, Bernstein told us she was invited to apply for a professorship in women’s and gender studies but declined to do so "in large part because of the changes in Texas law to allow guns in class." Bernstein shared a portion of her November 2015 email to Moore about deciding not to apply. The email says Bernstein had been "watching the madness with the Texas legislature" and wasn’t more than 50 percent sure she’d accept the UT job if it were offered. Concerned outside speaker Moore, asked about speakers deciding not coming to campus, pointed us to Paloma Diaz, an administrator in UT’s Teresa Lozano Long Institute for Latin American Studies. Diaz said by phone that a speaker who teaches at the University of Washington cited the gun law in initially resisting the institute’s invitation to give a talk in fall 2016, though she said the speaker subsequently relented. Diaz said she didn’t have permission to identify the speaker. Otherwise, a web search showed the institute has posted a notice that Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, a UW professor, is expected to visit and give talks Sept. 26, 2016. Godoy didn't respond to our query. We couldn’t fairly consider a couple of late-breaking instances of invited speakers deciding not to come to UT because their decisions became public after Moore spoke to NPR. Still: --A Duke University professor, Karla Holloway, wrote Phillip Barrish, a UT English professor, that she was rescinding her acceptance of Barrish’s invitation to speak on the campus in fall 2016. Holloway wrote Aug. 26, 2016: "I believe guns, and especially the vulnerabilities exposed in conceal carry cultures, contribute mightily to our nation’s public health crisis. And with the conceal carry now in full effect there, and after discussion with my family, I just cannot come." To our inquiry, Holloway forwarded a copy of the emailed March 2016 invitation from Barrish that she and Barrish told us she’d previously accepted. --Neuberger separately alerted us to a Texas Christian University historian, Hanan Hammad, reversing course about speaking at UT, also while citing the gun law (which allows private universities like TCU to opt out of the mandate). To our inquiry, Hammad forwarded her Aug. 26, 2016, email rescinding her agreement to speak in October 2016. Hammad wrote that "with campus carry now in full effect at UT, I just cannot come. I'm always proud to be a UT alumnus and I owe my mentors and teachers great deal, but I'm in full solidarity with all UT faculty, staff, and students whose health and lives are in danger due to campus carry. I believe open or conceal carry on campus is wrong and dangerous." UT administration suggests claim solid We also asked a university spokesman, Gary Susswein, about the accuracy of Moore’s claim. Susswein responded by emailing a web link to an August 2016 statement by sociologist Harry Edwards, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, in which Edwards said that due to implementation of the gun law, he was rescinding his permission to present UT lectures on sport and society, launched in 2014, in his name. "My decision was an exceedingly difficult one," Edwards wrote, "but silence is evil's greatest and most consistently dependable ally." Another campus spokesman, J.B. Bird, said by email the administration could confirm Moore’s claim. Bird didn’t identify resistant individuals by name though he wrote that the university provost’s office "confirmed hearing of a few people who decided not to interview and who stated that it was because of campus carry. Similarly, Bird said, provost officials say "they have heard of a few cases of faculty speakers who have decided not to come to campus to give talks because of the law." Bird said too that "we know of students changing their minds about coming based on campus carry. Our admissions office said when the law was announced they received about 10 calls and 10-15 emails with applicants saying that they were not coming or would not apply. We assume that we don’t hear from 100 percent of the people who make this decision. "That said," Bird wrote, "we did just admit the largest incoming freshmen class in UT’s history, with about 8,500 freshman. From what we have seen, though, the assertion is true that some individuals have chosen not to come because of the new state law." Our ruling Moore told NPR there are "concrete examples" of UT job applicants, prospective students and invited speakers deciding not to come to the university because of conceal-carry permit holders newly being allowed to bring handguns into campus buildings including classrooms. Not naming names, UT’s administration says this is so. We separately identified two out-of-state professors, a prospective graduate student and the mother of a high school student who cited the change in gun law and policy for not continuing to seek a UT position or not applying to come there--plus an outside speaker who reportedly resisted an invitation to speak on campus before relenting.

pomt-02133	The proposed Gogebic mine in northern Wisconsin "could be extended as long as 21 miles."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/08/dan-kaufman/Dan-Kaufman-claims-gogebic-iron-mine-could-extend/	Much of the debate over the proposed Gogebic mine in northern Wisconsin has turned on environmental and economic concerns. Less attention has been paid to the size of the project. In an opinion piece in the New York Times Sunday Review, "The fight for Wisconsin’s soul," Dan Kaufman discusses the open pit iron mine that Gogebic Taconite wants to build in Iron and Ashland counties. Kaufman is a Wisconsin native, writer and musician who lives in Brooklyn N.Y. He’s also a freelance fact checker for the Times and has previously written about Wisconsin politics for the paper. "The $1.5 billion mine would initially be close to four miles long, up to a half-mile wide and nearly 1,000 feet deep, but it could be extended as long as 21 miles," Kaufman wrote in the piece published March 29, 2014. That’s about the distance from Milwaukee’s Bradford Beach to, say, downtown Waukesha. We’ve considered a couple of previous statements that addressed the size of the mine. We rated True a claim by state Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee, who said the mine would be larger than his Assembly district, which is among the smallest in the state. State Rep. Penny Bernard Schaber, D-Appleton, said the mine would be two-thirds the size of Lake Winnebago. We rated that Mostly False. So what about Kaufman’s claim that the mine could be 21 miles long? Kaufman said the estimate was based on news reports, and documents that the company filed with the state of Wisconsin. Those records show Gogebic has an option to purchase the iron found in the deposit, which is 21 miles long, threading through the the Penokee mountain range. "You'll notice our phrase says ‘but it could be extended as long as 21 miles,’" Kaufman said in an email. "We don't say it will be for sure. The company has many potential phases outlined of this project." Here’s how the Department of Natural Resources describes the proposed mine on its website: "Gogebic is currently considering potential development along a four-mile stretch east of Mellen in west-central Ashland County." So, what accounts for the difference? Digging in The permit process for the mine is in the early stages, said Larry Lynch, a hydrogeologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He is the agency’s top administrator overseeing the project. The first stage would actually be two pits, each two miles long. That’s different from a single giant trench suggested in Kaufman’s claim. Kaufman describes a mine that if fully developed could be 21 miles long, a half mile wide and 1,000 feet deep. There’s no question this would be an immense project, if it happens. But the mine would never look like that. Lynch said the first phase involves the excavation of a pit, which would, in turn, be filled in by the next pit. (Separately, we rated Mostly True a Kaufman claim that the company would be allowed to fill in "pristine streams and ponds with mine waste.") In any case, the mine’s first phase would operate for a projected 35 years. The mine faces strong opposition from the neighboring Bad River band of the Chippewa. And the permitting process would be repeated if the company wanted to mine any additional part of the deposit. That would depend upon what happens with the first phase, and comes with a host of unknowns. Geologists believe the deposit extends 21 miles, but Lynch said "we do not have any information that says it will be economical" for the company to mine all of the iron in the deposit. The iron in the latter phases might been too difficult to extract, in part because the iron is laced throughout the mountains in that region of the state. In any case, no one is suggesting the mine -- even if it was fully developed decades from now -- would be a single, 21-mile-long pit. Our rating Kaufman says the mine "could be extended as long as 21 miles." That’s the size of the deposit that Gogebic Taconite has the rights to mine. But the initial phase envisioned in the permitting process is a four-mile stretch. Any additional mining would require another permitting process and would be decades away. And that’s only if the company decides it’s worth the effort. Yourdictionary.com says: "The definition of ‘could’ is often used in the place of ‘can’ to show a little doubt." But there’s more than a little doubt here. Kaufman’s statement may be partially true, but it leaves out important information and details. That’s our definition of Half True.

pomt-15047	"When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/29/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-when-he-left-us-house-we-had-5-tr/	Against the backdrop of acrimony in the House Republican Caucus -- leading to the resignation of Speaker John Boehner last week -- Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is harking back to his own tenure in the House, when, in his view, things moved more smoothly. "Look, I was there in the '90s when we actually got things done," Kasich said in an interview on CBS’ Face the Nation. "Think about it. We changed the welfare system, which had been in place for about 40 years. We balanced the budget, of which I was chief architect. And we cut taxes. The economy was growing and we were doing great. And when I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus." A reader asked us about the $5 trillion number, and we didn’t recall the surplus ever having been that high. So we looked back at the data. Kasich, now the second-term governor of Ohio, last served in the House in 2000, a year when Bill Clinton was ending his tenure in the White House and the Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress. That year, the federal government registered a $236 billion surplus. In raw dollars, that’s the biggest one-year surplus in American history, but it’s not anywhere near the $5-trillion number that Kasich mentioned. So what’s going on? The Kasich campaign said it came from a 10-year figure for the size of the future surplus as determined by the Clinton administration in 2000. The administration projected a cumulative $5 trillion surplus over 10 years, 2001 through 2010. (We should note the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, projected a lower surplus over the same time period of $4.6 trillion.) Of course, this never actually panned out, for a variety of reasons, including the technology bust, the post-9/11 attack recession and the Bush tax cuts, which decreased tax revenues collected. The bigger problem with Kasich’s claim is the shorthand terminology used to describe that number. Even though Kasich said, "When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus," the government never actually had a $5 trillion surplus in hand -- it had a projected $5 trillion surplus (and it was over 10 years, not one). That projection was also subject to numerous assumptions about future growth in spending and revenues -- assumptions that, as it turned out, didn’t hold. Kasich’s campaign acknowledged that his phrasing was somewhat elliptical. "It’s a bit of budget jargon to shorthand it to a ‘$5 trillion surplus’ and leave off the ‘projected,’ but it reflects the way these types of projections are used in policy and budget planning," said Chris Schrimpf, a spokesman for Kasich. Kasich "typically notes that the $5 trillion was a projected surplus, but failed to do so in this instance," added Rob Nichols, another Kasich spokesman. Our ruling Kasich said, "When I left Washington, we had a $5 trillion surplus." His rationale for the $5 trillion figure is reasonably sound, but he was inaccurate in how he referred to it. It was a 10-year cumulative projection for future surpluses, rather than a one-year actual surplus, and the savings turned out to be ephemeral due to unforeseen events. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2015-09-29T15:56:27	2015-09-27	['None']
pomt-14349	"Today, the United States has, sadly, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/mar/23/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-claim-about-us-having-one-lowest-vo/	Does the United States have a lower voter turnout rate than countries from Germany to Greece, and the Netherlands to New Zealand? Democratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd in San Diego Tuesday night that America lags far behind the world’s major countries in carrying out this civic duty. "Today, the United States has, sadly, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth," Sanders claimed. Sanders makes the claim about low voter turnout at the 17:08 minute mark in the above C-SPAN.org video. Sanders added in a news conference on Wednesday that high voter turnout – particularly among younger and progressive Californians – is key to him winning the Golden State, where turnout has plummeted in recent elections. And while California’s voting struggles have been well documented, we decided to check Sanders’ claim that the country as a whole is mired in a deep turnout slump. The iconoclastic politician has captured strong support from young people during his run for president. That group has traditionally lagged behind on voter turnout. Experts say he must continue to persuade them to vote in high numbers to stand a chance of upsetting frontrunner Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination. Our research As of Wednesday afternoon, the Sanders campaign had not responded to our request for sources backing up the senator’s claim. But, we found, there’s not much debate about America’s poor voting rate. Last May, the Pew Research Center ranked the United States 31st among 34 developed countries in voting turnout. The center examined votes cast as a percentage of countries’ estimated voting-age population. Looking at votes cast for president in 2012, turnout in the United States was 53.6 percent. The highest comparable rates were in Belgium (87.2 percent), Turkey (86.4 percent) and Sweden (82.6 percent). Meanwhile, Germany had a 66 percent turnout and the United Kingdom’s rate was 61 percent. Smaller players on the national stage, such as Greece, the Netherlands and New Zealand, also all outranked America by a wide margin. Of course, there’s a big caveat. Nearly 30 countries, including six in the group studied by the Pew Research Center, have compulsory voting, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Those include Belgium and Turkey, which had the highest turnout rates. Another factor at play is that many countries, like Sweden and Germany, automatically register citizens to vote. In the United States, that responsibility tends to rest with the individual. Our ruling Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has made boosting voter turnout a big part of his presidential campaign. He continued that focus in San Diego by saying the United States "has, sadly, one of the lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth." Research on the topic shows the United States does, indeed, rank near the bottom in turnout among developed countries. But unlike the U.S., some of those countries require their citizens to cast ballots. And others automatically register them to vote. Sanders’ statement wasn’t wrong, but it left out information that would have helped paint the full picture. We rate his claim Mostly True. In the end, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-06161	"We’re $15 trillion now in debt, with a president that’s racked up as much debt as almost all of the other presidents combined."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/16/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-has-racked-much-debt-almost/	During the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Mitt Romney took a shot at President Barack Obama’s handling of the economy and the federal budget. "We all understand that the spending crisis is extraordinary, with $15 trillion now in debt, with a president that’s racked up as much debt as almost all of the other presidents combined." If this sounds familiar, it is: It’s a variation on a claim we’ve addressed before. Romney said something similar at a roundtable of small business leaders in Salem, N.H., on June 27, 2011. Romney said that Obama "is on track to have added so much debt to this country, that by the end of his first term, he will have added as much debt as all the prior presidents of this country combined." We rated the statement Mostly True. But the second statement won’t get the same rating, for a couple of reasons. Type of debt being measured There are actually two main ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. The other is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future. In June, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told us that the candidate was referring to debt held by the public, so we used that for our measurements. But Romney’s comment from the Sioux City debate was less clear. In the debate, Romney initially said the nation is "$15 trillion now in debt." That’s a measure of gross federal debt -- which is not the measurement he’d been using in previous statements. We were confused about how to proceed, so we checked with the Romney camp. They confirmed that Romney was basing his comparison on public debt. That clarifies our assignment, but it does mean that Romney offered contradictory information in making his debt comparison. Time frame In the earlier statement at the New Hampshire roundtable, Romney was pretty clear that he was talking about how much Obama will have added "by the end of his first term." By contrast, the more recent statement from Sioux City lacks that qualifier, and instead makes it sound like Romney was referring to the amount of debt Obama has racked up so far in his term. The extra year or more in Obama’s first term adds enough debt to make a significant difference in the result. To analyze Romney’s comparison requires determining the start and end points for calculating how much of the debt can be categorized as falling within Obama’s first term. This is not as easy as it sounds. Obama took office on January 20, 2009, but who "owns" the debt recorded for fiscal year 2009 is unclear. Obama signed off on the budget that year, but it was assembled during Bush’s term, and it does not really bear Obama’s imprint. When judging Romney’s claim from the Sioux City debate -- how much debt has accumulated so far during Obama’s term -- we believe that there are three plausible date ranges: -- October 1, 2008 (the start of fiscal 2009) to Dec. 14, 2011 (the day before the Sioux City debate) -- January 20, 2009 (the day of Obama’s inauguration) to Dec. 14, 2011 -- October 1, 2009 (the start of fiscal 2010, Obama's first full budget year) to Dec. 14, 2011 We are able to calculate the debt figures using the U.S. Department of Treasury’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator. Here are the public debt totals accumulated during the three periods we listed above: * End of fiscal year 2008, when the accrued debt under the 43 presidents was $5.851 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined. * Obama inauguration, when the accrued debt was $6.307 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined. * End of fiscal year 2009, when the accrued debt was $7.506 trillion, to Dec. 14, 2011, when the debt was $10.393 trillion. No, not more than the previous 43 presidents combined. What’s the meaning of "almost"? In the Sioux City debate -- but not the New Hampshire roundtable -- Romney gave himself some breathing room by inserting the word "almost." But what he meant by that "almost" is not so obvious. In the actual quote, Romney places "almost" before "every president." We’re not quite sure how one would define "almost every president" -- do you drop George W. Bush, who accumulated a lot of debt, or William Henry Harrison, who died a few weeks into his term? If you subtract George W. Bush from the calculation, it's a very favorable way to calculate it from Romney’s perspective, and in fact for one of the measurements -- comparing the accumulated debt level at the start of fiscal 2001 to what Obama has added so far, Obama’s figure is higher. But when we talked to the Romney camp, they said that the candidate had actually meant to say, "almost as much debt as." So how does that formulation mesh with our math above? Under the first of our three scenarios, the debt under Obama has increased by about 78 percent of the amount it rose under the previous 43 presidents. That’s off by more than 20 percent. The other two scenarios don’t come that close. For the second scenario, it’s 65 percent, and for the third, it’s 38 percent. An additional point that affects all comparisons of this sort: Because of the effects of inflation, it’s not entirely fair to compare debt accumulated today to debt accumulated in the time of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln or Theodore Roosevelt. But neutralizing that problem isn’t easy, so we won’t do anything beyond noting the issue. Our ruling Romney was trying to revive a talking point -- that by the end of his first term, Obama will have added as much debt as all the prior 43 presidents combined -- that was accurate enough to earn a Mostly True from PolitiFact. This time, though, he allowed small but significant changes to creep in and weaken its accuracy. Romney confused public debt and gross debt; he failed to clarify that he was talking about the debt accruing during the entirety of Obama’s first term; and he misplaced the word "almost" in a way that makes it hard to parse his claim. If we use the public debt figure and put the word "almost" where the Romney campaign says it should be, "almost" might apply to one of three comparisons -- one in which the debt is about four-fifths of the way to equalling totals under previous presidents. That’s a grain of truth, but not much more. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-12-16T15:53:24	2011-12-15	['None']
pomt-05863	Says he signed legislation leading to 12 Texas abortion clinics being closed.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/feb/10/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-signed-legislation-leading-clos/	At a Personhood USA forum in South Carolina last month, Texas Gov. Rick Perry praised a move by Texas lawmakers to "de-fund" Planned Parenthood, which runs family planning and abortion clinics around the country. According to a Jan. 18, 2012, account by Politico, Perry said: "I was really proud to be able to sign legislation that we worked with our legislature to defund Planned Parenthood in the state of Texas. There are 12 abortion clinics that aren’t open in the state of Texas today because our members of the Legislature had the courage, the wisdom to do that." Perry’s statement, made the day before he dropped his bid for president, came to our attention from Sarah Wheat, interim co-CEO of the Austin-area Planned Parenthood, who told us via email that none of the clinics Perry referenced provided abortions -- and that 11, not 12, clinics closed. Wheat told us the Texas clinics to which Perry referred were "nonprofit health centers … that provided family planning health exams, cancer screenings, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and other basic health care." Wheat said in another email that the clinics were located in Arlington, Gainesville, Mesquite, Plano, Terrell, Mission, Progreso, Rio Grande City, San Carlos, Alice and Brownsville. She said clinics that provide abortions are ineligible for state funds, while the closed clinics had been receiving state money until September 2011, the beginning of the state’s new fiscal year. Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), advised by email that there are now 156 state-supported family planning clinics -- compared to 300 through August 2011. Previously, such clinics served 220,000 women a year, she said, while expectations are that the remaining state-supported clinics will serve about 60,000 women a year through August 2013. In a telephone interview, Williams confirmed that abortion clinics do not receive state or federal funding. In an email, she said the clinics that closed had each received state funding in 2011. Separately, she said that had those clinics provided abortions, they would not have been eligible for state money. Perry repeated his characterization of the shuttered clinics at a Feb. 6, 2012, Republican Party event north of Austin, according to a KVUE-TV report. "Since I signed that budget," Perry said then, "there have been about a dozen Planned Parenthood 'abortion clinics' that have shut down in this state. There are lives that have been saved." We asked Perry spokesman Josh Havens for backup information on the governor’s claim that legislative action caused abortion-providing clinics to close. Havens said in a telephone interview that he didn’t know which, if any, of the clinics performed abortions. Regardless, Havens said, he would "make the argument that a Planned Parenthood clinic is an abortion clinic." "Even if the specific clinic was (for) family planning, it’s affiliated with its parent organization, which does do abortions," Havens said. Havens agreed in an email that clinics that provide abortion services are ineligible for state funds. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. bills itself as "the nation's leading sexual and reproductive health care provider and advocate" and runs its sexual health clinics through local affiliates. About 3 percent of the services Planned Parenthood offers are abortion services, the organization says. In Texas, 14 Planned Parenthood-affiliated clinics provide abortions, according to information on Planned Parenthood’s website. Wheat said its 51 other clinics in the state focus on preventive services, including the provision of contraception and screenings for cervical and breast cancer. The organization also offers some services for men. Nationally and in Texas, whether government funding should pay for abortions has long been debated. Title X of the Public Health Service Act, enacted in 1970, stipulated that federal family planning funds could not be used for abortions, according to Elizabeth Nash, a specialist in state-level sexual health policy at the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde amendment, significantly reducing federal funding of abortions by banning Medicaid and other programs from spending federal funds on the procedures except in cases of rape or incest, or when the woman’s life is in danger. In Texas, various laws have addressed the issue of state funding for abortions since the 1990s. But 2003 was a pivotal year. Before then, "Planned Parenthood and other providers that pay for abortions with non-tax dollars received state money to provide Pap smears, well-woman exams, counseling and mammograms, mostly for low-income patients," according to a May 23, 2003, Austin American-Statesman news article. In 2003, the newly Republican-majority Texas House and Republican-steered Senate agreed to a budget provision barring federal family planning funds from being distributed to health care facilities that performed abortions. In subsequent legislative sessions, lawmakers renewed that language in each budget. Sometimes, they advanced into law additional proposals intended to keep public funds from reaching abortion providers and clinics affiliated with the providers. So, what exactly did the 2011 Legislature do that affected the Planned Parenthood clinics? To our inquiry, Williams of the DSHS pointed out two actions. First, Williams said, lawmakers reduced the department’s family planning funding by two-thirds. That is, they appropriated $38 million for family planning services for 2012-13, compared to the $111 million budgeted in 2009-10. Williams said the reduction wiped out funds to some of the Planned Parenthood clinics that ultimately shut down. Besides the funding cut, Williams said, lawmakers advanced two measures, House Bill 1 and Senate Bill 7, restructuring the way funding is allotted for the DSHS-supported family planning centers in the state. "It stands to reason that (there are fewer clinics now) because of the budget cuts," Williams said. "The budget for family planning was reduced dramatically, and that’s going to change the financial outlook for clinics. There’s less money available." Under the restructuring provision, state family planning aid is awarded first to public entities, like state health clinics, that provide family planning services, and last to clinics--like Planned Parenthood--that don’t provide comprehensive health services. The budget cuts and establishment of the tiered funding system "changed the landscape for Planned Parenthood and other providers," Williams said. Wheat said that the cut in family planning aid caused the Planned Parenthood clinics to shut down. "The number one, primary reason for these closures is there’s one-third of the funds that used to be available," she said. "There’s precious few dollars in the state that are left." Some Planned Parenthood clinics, including an East Austin clinic now dependent on donations, had previously relied on the state funding to survive, Wheat said. She speculated that when Perry celebrated the 12 closures, he might have been including the East Austin clinic. So, legislative moves approved by Perry evidently led to at least 11 Planned Parenthood clinic closings. Presuming those clinics did not provide abortions, since they were eligible for state money, we asked Wheat whether shuttered clinics could still be reasonably associated with abortion clinics -- and if that, as Perry’s spokesman suggested, makes them about the same as abortion clinics. Wheat said the family planning clinics and abortion service providers were entirely separate, independent nonprofit organizations, per language inserted into each budget since the 2003 legislative session that requires the separation of such institutions in order for family planning clinics to be eligible for state funds. "We are all Planned Parenthood health centers, but the services that are provided and how we’re legally operated and governed, those are all completely independent," Wheat explained. She said that while Planned Parenthood family planning and abortion clinics fall under the same umbrella organization, and all have to meet certain requirements--professional standards for personnel, for example--the two kinds of clinics are entirely separate, maintaining different bank accounts, different governing boards and filing separate tax returns. At Planned Parenthood family planning clinics, Wheat said, counselors inform women facing unintended pregnancy of three options: adoption, abortion or prenatal care. Wheat said that if a woman chooses the abortion option, a counselor talks with her about how to proceed and offers a list of resources including abortion providers. However, Wheat said, the family planning clinics do not transfer any client’s medical records to an abortion clinic or otherwise provide medical referrals. Clinics will, however, transfer official medical records for women who opt for prenatal care, she said. As we closed out this research, we asked Joe Pojman, executive director of the anti-abortion Texas Alliance for Life, to assess Perry’s statement. Pojman said that as far he knows, no Texas abortion clinics shut down as a result of Texas legislative decisions in 2011. Perry, he speculated, was suggesting that Planned Parenthood’s family planning clinics are closely related to the abortion services affiliated with the overarching Planned Parenthood group. Havens responded to a follow-up request for clarification of the governor’s statement in an email: "The governor meant what he said. Planned Parenthood clinics either perform abortions or refer women to affiliated abortion clinics. Neither the governor nor the Texas Legislature make a distinction between whether the abortion is performed on premises or enabled through an affiliate. When a Planned Parenthood clinic closes, it can no longer perform this function." Our ruling Planned Parenthood clinics shut down due to legislative decisions approved by Perry. But Perry's key point -- that the clinics provided abortions -- is unsupported. Abortion providers had been ineligible for state funding for years. This reference to abortion is critical to Perry's claim, which we rate Mostly False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-02-10T13:46:25	2012-01-18	['Texas']
pomt-03505	"During the Bush administration, liberal groups were targeted" by the IRS, similar to recent targeting.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/06/jim-mcdermott/irs-targeted-liberal-groups-bush-years-jim-mcdermo/	At a House Ways and Means committee hearing Tuesday, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., listened closely to the stories from members of groups that were snagged when the IRS cast a wide net for politically active organizations seeking tax-exempt status. All of the groups advocate for conservative causes, from opposing gay marriage to promoting a broad tea party agenda. While McDermott said he was sorry they had been singled out, and that "the IRS has unequivocally made a mistake here," he was more focused on the lack of clear legal rules that should guide the IRS. "Let’s not get lost," McDermott said. "During the Bush administration liberal groups were targeted without any concern by Mr. Issa or anyone else in this committee." (Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., is chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.) This caught our eye. Were liberal groups targeted when a Republican held the White House? And if so, were the circumstances back then similar to what has come to light today? We asked McDermott’s office for details and staff pointed us to a recent Salon article that described how the IRS subjected the NAACP, Greenpeace and a liberal Episcopal church in California to sometimes intense scrutiny. In 2004, the IRS audited the NAACP after its chairman said President George W. Bush was the first sitting president since Herbert Hoover who declined to speak before the group. The same year, the IRS moved to revoke the tax-exempt status of All Saints Episcopal in Pasadena. The Sunday before the 2004 election, the rector told the congregation "Jesus (would say), ‘Mr. President, your doctrine of pre-emptive war is a failed doctrine.' " That case dragged on for three years before the IRS dropped it. From 2004 to 2009, the IRS had a Political Activities Compliance Initiative aimed at 501(c)(3) groups that might have endorsed a candidate or otherwise crossed the line between charitable work and electioneering. In 2004, the IRS opened cases on 110 groups. While there were allegations and even lawsuits claiming that the IRS took a light hand with churches that promoted conservative candidates, a 2005 audit by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found no political bias. "We ... did not identify any cases in which the same criteria were used to select one information item for examination and to decline a similar item for examination," the auditors wrote. The current controversy involves the examination of nearly 300 groups and there are significant differences today from the examples cited in the Salon article: The inspector general found that IRS staff used "inappropriate criteria" to identify groups for special attention. A group’s name or a focus on government debt and spending triggered IRS action, rather than the group’s activities. Most of the groups, about 70 percent, held or were applying for 501(c)(4) status, not 501(c)(3). The limits on (c)(3) groups -- the ones examined under Bush -- are much more strict than for (c)(4) groups. The inspector general found that all cases with "tea party," "patriots" or "9/12" in their name were singled out. All the experts we contacted said the rules concerning what 501(c)(4) groups can and cannot do are vague and leave the door open to excesses by the IRS. McDermott’s office said that the congressman’s point was that while the recent IRS actions were unacceptable, they don’t represent a political conspiracy or a unique occurrence. Nevertheless, McDermott’s comparison falls short on a number of fronts. David Keating, president of the conservative leaning group, Center for Competitive Politics, sees nothing similar between what happened under Bush and what happened under Obama. "I just don't’ see this as being in the same league," Keating said. The key difference is the global impact of the IRS screening. "What the IRS did with the tea party groups is they set them aside and every single one got special scrutiny because of the philosophy of the organization." In contrast, Keating said, there is no evidence that the IRS under Bush targeted all environmental groups or all progressive churches. Another legal expert, Bruce Fein, who served in the Reagan Justice Department, said McDermott’s comparison also falls short because the rules concerning (c)(3) groups are so tight. "Even the tiniest political activity would raise a flag with a (c)(3). You would naturally expect that there is going to be a more exacting examination." On the other hand, Gabe Rottman, legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said we should withhold full judgment on the IRS actions during the 18 months between 2010 and 2012. "We don't know if it was a good faith mistake or if it was an effort by people at the IRS to target these groups because of their political beliefs," Rottman said. "What happened under Bush, the mechanics might be different, but the existence of a situation that allows selective enforcement is a problem across both administrations." That said, Rottman agreed that the systematic screening criticized in the present inspector general’s report creates greater harm than the more case-by-case instances during the Bush administration. We should note that the IRS’s more recent methods caught up at least three Democratic-leaning groups. Bloomberg reported that Emerge America, Progress Texas and Clean Elections Texas received IRS letters requesting more information. Emerge America ultimately saw its tax-exempt status denied, making it the only group to suffer that fate during this episode. Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an organization that has sued the IRS for failing to rein in conservative 501(c)(4) groups, said she has no doubt the Bush administration went after the NAACP and others because it didn’t like them. But she finds little use for McDermott’s comparison. "It’s apples and oranges," Sloan said. "Those were big organizations with an established track record. What you have here are new groups asking for special tax status, and the IRS was legitimately asking them if they engaged in political activities to see if it exceeded what the law allows." Our ruling McDermott said liberal groups were targeted during the Bush administration. While some liberal groups were audited, the numbers we could find were small, largely confined to 501(c)(3) nonprofits where the rules are more strict, and stemmed from complaints levied by outsiders. In contrast, the current case was fueled by internal bureaucratic rules applied to a significantly larger number of organizations. A group’s name or its policy agenda triggered the IRS action, rather than a complaint or the group’s specific activities. While there is an element of truth in McDermott’s statement, the systematic nature of the IRS actions between 2010 and 2012 represents a distinctly different set of circumstances. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Jim McDermott	None	None	None	2013-06-06T11:01:25	2013-06-04	['None']
pomt-06680	Says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security must report to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees.	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/08/tom-kean-sr/former-new-jersey-gov-tom-kean-claims-homeland-sec/	People look at former Gov. Tom Kean in disbelief when he says the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees. Kean, the former head of the 9/11 Commission, received the same reaction from radio host Brian Lehrer on Aug. 30 when discussing counter-terrorism efforts as the country approaches the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. During the WNYC broadcast from Montclair State University, Lehrer asked Kean about a May 2010 article on NJ.com, in which Kean is quoted as saying "Homeland Security spends way too much of its time reporting to the 100 congressional subcommittees that claim some type of jurisdiction." Lehrer asked Kean, "Is it really a hundred or were you just kind of using an expression?" Kean responded: "I wish I was. No, it’s about a hundred…Believe it or not, if you can imagine this, let’s say you’re (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary) Janet Napolitano and you’ve been given a job of running Homeland Security. In other words, protecting all of us. "And all of sudden, you find out you’re reporting to a hundred different committees and subcommittees in (the) United States Congress. And you’re spending at least a third of your time preparing testimony or testifying, you and your top deputies. That’s a third of your time you’re not spending protecting us. This is dysfunctional." That may be dysfunctional, but it’s also true. PolitiFact New Jersey discovered Kean was right -- Homeland Security must report to 108 congressional committees and subcommittees, according to the department. Between Jan. 1 and Aug. 26, Homeland Security officials testified at 120 hearings and provided about 1,809 briefings to congressional offices, according to department records. Napolitano also has expressed concern with her department’s level of congressional oversight. "This often results in our principals and their staff spending more time responding to congressional requests and requirements than executing their mandated homeland security responsibilities," Napolitano wrote in an April 2010 letter to U.S. Rep. Peter King (R-NY). The number of congressional eyeballs on Homeland Security operations has been subject to continued criticism in the years since the department was formed. Created slightly more than a year after Sept. 11, Homeland Security combined all or part of 22 different federal departments and agencies. According to its July 2004 report, the 9/11 Commission recommended reforming congressional oversight of Homeland Security, which was then answering to 88 committees and subcommittees. A few months later, a report from a group of former legislators and other individuals noted that oversight of the U.S. Department of Defense was much different. "In comparison, the Department of Defense, with a budget that is more than ten times greater than DHS, reports to only 36 committees and subcommittees in the House and the Senate," according to that December 2004 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies and Business Executives for National Security. Following the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and another federal panel, Congress took "a few incremental steps," such as forming the House Homeland Security Committee, according to a December 2008 report from the Commission on the Prevention of WMD Proliferation and Terrorism. But that report said "the creation of these new committees (and subcommittees) did nothing to streamline the number of congressional panels to which DHS must respond." More criticism of Homeland Security’s oversight came as recently as last week, when Kean and other members of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s National Security Preparedness Group -- a follow-up to the 9/11 Commission -- issued a "report card" on the status of the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations. That report card said "too many committees have concurrent and overlapping jurisdiction. This is a recipe for confusion." King, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, pledged in a Sept. 1 press release to continue working with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and other House leaders to reform congressional oversight of Homeland Security. The ruling As unbelievable as it may sound to his listeners, Kean accurately states that Homeland Security answers to about 100 congressional committees and subcommittees. It’s a level of oversight that has attracted the criticism of various entities and the Homeland Security Secretary herself. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12402	"You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license" in Florida.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/may/25/desmond-meade/driving-suspended-license-can-lead-loss-voting-rig/	Desmond Meade, a convicted drug offender who later turned his life around and graduated from law school, is leading the effort in Florida to automatically restore voting rights to many felons. Meade’s effort to put a question on the Florida ballot got a major plug from comedian Samantha Bee, who used her TBS show Full Frontal on May 10 to highlight the topic of how felons struggle to regain civil rights in Florida. "Ever since losing the popular vote, President (Donald) Trump has had his Underoos in a wad about 3 million people who voted illegally," Bee said, setting up her interview with Meade. "They don't exist. What does exist is 6 million people whose right to vote has been taken away. To learn about them, I went to Florida, where retirees and democracy go to die." Meade, from Orlando, told Bee that in Florida, 1.68 million felons have lost the right to vote. And some of those felonies are less serious than others. "It doesn’t matter if it's a first degree or third degree. You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license," he said. "Come on Florida," Bee replied, "do you really want to be the Florida of everything?" Meade has a point that not all the felonies that cost a person their right to vote are as egregious as murder or sexual assault. For this fact-check, we wanted to know if driving with a suspended license could really cost a Floridian his or her civil rights, and how often it happens. Restoration of rights for felons is a hot topic in Florida, a swing state where any significant changes to the voting population can have a big impact. Research in a few states has shown that more felons after being released from prison register as Democrats than Republicans. All felony convictions cost Floridians the right to vote In April, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously approved language for a proposed amendment to restore voting rights to felons after they complete their sentences. The next hurdle for advocates including Meade is to collect about 700,000 signatures to place a question on the ballot in 2018. (Meade, a recovered drug addict, is among felons who have lost their civil rights: He served about three years in prison after a conviction for a 2001 firearm possession charge.) The proposed amendment calls for restoring voting rights for felons automatically once they have completed their sentences including parole or probation. Automatic restoration would not apply to felons convicted of murder or sexual offenses, who would still have to ask the Florida Cabinet and Gov. Rick Scott to restore their rights in a slow and cumbersome process. While the policy extends back to the Jim Crow era and makes Florida an outlier nationally, there have been efforts to make the process easier. In 2007 under then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, felons convicted of less serious offenses could regain their rights without a hearing after finishing their sentences. However, in 2011, the Republican Cabinet, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Gov. Rick Scott scrapped that process and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period. Since 2011 through April 1, 2017, about 2,600 felons have gotten their rights restored while more than 10,000 cases are pending. That means that felons don’t necessarily lose their rights for the rest of their life, but it’s a long and cumbersome process and ultimately the Cabinet can deny restoring someone’s rights. The Florida Constitution (section 4a) states: "No person convicted of a felony, or adjudicated in this or any other state to be mentally incompetent, shall be qualified to vote or hold office until restoration of civil rights or removal of disability." That broadly applies to all types of felonies, experts said. "Any felony conviction in Florida, no matter how small or seemingly trivial, results in the loss of your civil rights," said Randall Berg of the Florida Justice Institute. Meade sent PolitiFact the statute about the penalties for driving with a suspended license in Florida. The law states that a first or second offense is a misdemeanor but a third or subsequent conviction is a third-degree felony. We were unable to find any data on how many people had lost their rights based on particular statutes. That makes it difficult to quantify which statutes most commonly, or infrequently, result in loss of rights. We were able to get data on the number of felony convictions for driving with a suspended license. There were 6,759 felony convictions between 2012 and 2016, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Advocates in favor of restoring rights to felons pointed to some other felonies that don’t exactly conjure up the image of threatening lawbreakers. Bee’s show highlighted some of those statutes, such as tampering with a lobster trap or an odometer -- both felonies, although they rarely result in convictions. Take the case, for example, of the man a state trooper said violated a rarely-prosecuted felony pollution statute when Anthony Brasfield released a dozen heart-shaped balloons in Broward around Valentine’s Day in 2013. Broward prosecutors didn’t file a case based on that statute, in part because prosecutors thought the jury would likely see this as a romantic gesture rather than a criminal act. Brasfield ultimately pled guilty to a lesser offense: a misdemeanor for driving while his license was suspended. Howard Simon, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, pointed to a few additional felony statutes, including knowingly presenting a counterfeit or altered state lottery ticket or trespassing on posted commercial horticultural property Our ruling Meade said, "It doesn’t matter if it's a first degree or third degree. You could lose your rights for life over something as simple as driving with a suspended license," he said. The Florida Constitution says people convicted of felonies cannot vote until their civil rights are restored, a process that takes years after felons complete their sentences and is ultimately up to the Florida Cabinet and governor. Meade omits an important caveat about the Florida statute specifically about driving with a suspended license: the first and second convictions are misdemeanors, so the crime only becomes a felony upon the third or subsequent conviction.

pomt-02066	Surface temperatures on Earth "have stabilized."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/27/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-surface-temperatures-earth-have-st/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been attracting a lot of attention recently for expressing skepticism about how much humans contribute to global warming and what policy approaches the United States should take. During a May 20, 2014, interview, Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly asked Rubio, "Now, you said (a) flat-out bold and fresh statement that you don't believe the scientists on global warming. Are you going up against these people?" Rubio responded, "No, here's the point. First of all, I have never denied the climate is changing. That shouldn't surprise us. The climate is always changing. The second point on the science is, the left loves to go around saying there is a consensus, there is a consensus. There is a majority of scientists that say that global carbon emissions by humans causes some changes in the climate. What there is no consensus on and (what) they conveniently ignore is there is no consensus on the sensitivity of the climate. How much is it changing and how much of it is directly attributable to human carbon emission? There is no consensus on that, which is why the models vary so greatly, which is why, despite 17 years of dramatic increases in carbon production by humans, surface temperatures (on) the earth have stabilized." We wondered whether Rubio was accurate when he said that surface temperatures on Earth "have stabilized." Rubio’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story. But in interviews with nearly a dozen scientists, we received a nuanced assessment of his remark. On the one hand, we found most accepting Rubio’s starting point -- that surface temperatures on earth, which were once rising rapidly, have "paused" their increase over the past 16 or 17 years. On the other hand, most of the scientists we checked with took exception to his use of the word "stabilized" to describe this phenomenon, saying the "pause" is temporary. While "stabilized" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of it, the reality, scientists say, is that temperatures will rise again, sooner or later. "Stabilized" is "a very poor word to use," said John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Rubio’s word choice "has no merit," agreed Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and a professor of geography at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Reto Ruedy, a climate specialist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, concurred, saying that the claim of stabilization had "no legitimacy." Even Paul C. "Chip" Knappenberger, a scholar at the Cato Institute, said Rubio had gone too far by saying the situation had "stabilized." While global warming "certainly has slowed down considerably" over the past 16 or 17 years, Knappenberger said confirmation that the situation has "stabilized" would take "another 10 to 20 years." "The pace will probably pick back up again at sometime in the future," Knappenberger said. "But when that will be, or what the new pace will be, are far from scientifically agreed upon characteristics." A closer look at the recent past Climate-change skeptics have made the pause a cornerstone of their argument that concern about global warming is overblown. And at least on the existence of a pause, the statistics are on their side. An interactive chart from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows land and ocean surface temperatures going back to the 1800s. While there’s been some variation in surface temperatures since 1998, it has remained within a relatively narrow band, which contrasts with the rapid rise during the decades that preceded it. (The strongest evidence of a pause is for the past 16 years, but we won’t quibble with Rubio’s use of the 17-year time frame.) Scientists also said that Rubio is correct to point to the uncertainty inherent in climate models. Mainstream climate scientists are taking the pause seriously. As PolitiFact Rhode Island has noted, the United Kingdom’s weather office has begun referring to the last 16 years as "the recent pause in warming." It’s worth noting that even at the level of the "pause," temperatures are still historically high. As we’ve previously noted, 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years, according to NASA. But importantly, most scientists do not expect the pause to continue indefinitely. The United Kingdom office published three reports in which they asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, though on an uncertain timetable. Judith Curry, who chairs the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology -- and who believes climate change is happening but has put more emphasis on the scientific uncertainties than other scientists -- said reasonable people can disagree with how quickly the temperature rise will begin and how far it will go. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international body that has been among the most prominent voices raising the specter of significant impacts from climate change, said it "expects the temperatures to resume increasing soon, whereas certain scientists, including myself, expect the current pause in surface temperatures to continue for another decade or two," Curry said. We couldn’t find any experts who believe temperatures have "stabilized" in the sense of settling down into a consistent pattern indefinitely. "Increases in Earth's temperature have indeed slowed, but have certainly not stabilized," said Rob Jackson, an earth sciences professor at Stanford University. "Every year is now what would have been a record year in the 1990s, and the last decade was the warmest in the modern record." Rubio’s statement "is misleading, because it implies that the climate has reached a balance or equilibrium, so that global temperatures will not rise in the future," agreed Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. "However, the earth's climate has not stabilized. In particular, the flow of energy into and out of the planet is not in balance. It is gaining more energy than it is losing, due to increased greenhouse gases, and therefore future warming is unavoidable." Explaining the paradox of the 'pause' The central paradox Rubio points out -- an increase in carbon dioxide emissions without a commensurate rise in surface temperatures -- has prompted several theories to explain it. One reason is that, over the long term, data always fluctuates somewhat. "The global average air temperature over the past 150 years has been characterized by overall rise," but superimposed on this general trend are "periods, lasting as much as several decades, of stronger warming, little change and even cooling," said Serreze of the University of Colorado-Boulder. Barring dramatic cuts in carbon emissions, Serreze suggested that 50 years from now, "the period of slower warming from the late 1990s to present will appear as just another blip on the overall pattern of warming." Some experts add that starting the count in 1998 exaggerates the "pause," since that was an unusually strong "El Nino" year. El Nino is an occasional pattern in ocean currents that significantly affects the weather globally, including raising global temperatures by releasing "tremendous amounts of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere," said Jennifer Francis, a research professor at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University. "To look at the trend of a relatively short period that started out with an extraordinary El Nino event causing a huge temperature spike is a cheap device," said Reto Ruedy of NASA’s Goddard Institute. The physical explanation gaining the most traction is that "the oceans have accumulated most of the heat from human-induced global warming," said Harold Wanless, University of Miami geological sciences professor. One recent paper found that in one part of the Pacific, middle-depth temperatures have been rising 15 times faster over the past six decades than at any other time over the past 10,000 years. Other papers have found similar evidence. Basic physics teaches that water has an immense ability to take in and hold heat -- but that same heat will eventually be released. "The trapped heat is still in the system, and it will be released into the atmosphere when the recent pattern of Pacific Ocean temperatures switches back to its warmer phase," said Francis of Rutgers. Other factors may also be playing a role in the "pause," said Reilly of MIT. In addition to an absence of strong El Nino events since 1998, Reilly said, the eruption of some moderate volcanoes may have produced cooling effects that counteracted some of the heating. And there’s evidence that the long-term data sets for temperature have under-recorded Arctic regions where temperatures have been rising most rapidly. "So, several factors that are known sources of variability in the climate system all, by coincidence, contributed to a cooling trend over the period," Reilly said. This suggests that global warming "was occurring -- it's just that the added warmth was going into the ocean. It’s unlikely that all of these coincidences will continue, or continue to offset warming." Our ruling Rubio said that "surface temperatures in the earth have stabilized." He has a point that over roughly the past decade and a half, global surface temperatures have "paused," particularly compared to their rapid rise in previous decades. But scientists we interviewed agreed that the use of the word "stabilized" represents an unjustified leap from the data, since "stabilized" suggests that we have gotten through the worst of climate change. At the very least, the uncertainty inherent in climate forecasting makes such a claim of "stabilization" premature. More likely, the evidence suggests that the "pause" in global surface temperatures is temporary, with temperatures poised to rise once the oceans start releasing more heat, such as during an El Nino event. It’s not clear when temperatures will rise again, but few scientists doubt that temperatures will rise again at some point. We rate Rubio’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-07904	Wisconsin employers have repeatedly said in surveys that our anti-business litigation climate is one of the most important factors affecting their expansion decisions.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/02/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-surveys-repeatedly-showed-bu/	Gov. Scott Walker sounded a bit defensive when signing a lawsuit-reform bill he called for during the Republican-controlled Legislature’s special January session. Walker told reporters he wanted the bill passed quickly to ease the threat of frivolous litigation, because Wisconsin has "out of control" lawsuit abuse -- and employers have made it a top complaint. We have already tackled the first part of that explanation. We gave a False ruling to a small business group’s claim that Wisconsin has one of the most anti-business injury-lawsuit systems in the country. (Wisconsin stands out on a few high-profile issues, but is generally rated middle of the pack or even better in legal-climate surveys). Addressing reporters at a Jan. 27, 2011, bill-signing ceremony, Walker elaborated on the second part of his rationale. "Time and time again on survey after survey," he said, "employers tell us that one of the most important elements when they are considering expanding and investing in the state, is what the litigation climate is." Is lawsuit reform really one of the top priorities for employers seeking a friendlier business climate? The legislative debate is over. But we thought it was worth a look back as the changes -- which critics say will harm consumer protection in injury cases -- go into effect. Walker, through spokesman Cullen Werwie, pointed us to four national surveys. One was a 2010 national poll for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an advocate of easing lawsuits on business. In it, 67% of lawyers for major corporations said the litigation environment is likely to affect business decisions such as where to do business. A second -- a 2007 national survey for the chamber -- found half of businesses were concerned about getting unfairly sued. In that group, 11% blamed lawsuit-related business decisions for laying off workers. The other two surveys, by private groups surveying the public and doctors, showed strong support for tort reform as part of federal health care legislation. The national surveys don’t break out any state-specific results or rank concerns about the litigation climate against the many other factors that play a role in relocation or expansion decisions. And Walker did not cite any information specifically about Wisconsin. So, we went looking for some Wisconsin data -- and what we found did not break in Walker’s favor. The most on-point data comes from the annual surveys by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, a trade group that represents 3,500 Wisconsin employers. In June 2010, 263 CEOs responded to the organization’s survey that asked executives to pick "one thing state government could do to improve Wisconsin’s business climate." The result: 1 percent named lawsuit reform. The group also did a narrower 2010 survey, of the group’s board of directors. None named it, and over the last five years just 3 percent to 6.4 percent of board members mentioned it. In a prior survey of its full membership, in 2001, the WMC did not even put tort reform on the list of possible answers to that question. In 2010, lawsuit reform tied for lowest among 10 concerns in the membership survey. Topping the wish list: reduced taxes, less regulation and cuts in government spending. The song was the same when the membership was asked to name "one thing state government could do to help your business." Lawsuit reform was a non-issue (0 percent) in most years, with a spike to 10 percent in 2004. WMC is most often associated with big business, but has a mix of members. What about small business? We checked with the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business. The chapter made the claim that we rated False about Wisconsin having one of the most unfriendly legal climates for business in the United States. The group’s state director, Bill Smith, said lawsuit reform is always among the five or six concerns of small businesses, but it’s hard to rank the issues. The group hasn’t polled its members specifically on it. Meanwhile, when the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce surveys its members, it lumps lawsuit reform in with regulation, so it’s impossible to say how big an issue it is. The lessons from these surveys: Lawsuit reform is a minor concern, or at least doesn’t stand out from the pack when businesses spell out what they want from government. But worries about lawsuits and their effect on business decisions are pretty widespread. Nevertheless, the business community has made a high-profile push in recent years to get changes in the legal climate. Various business and industry organizations even formed a coalition to lobby on the issue. Business concerns grew after Wisconsin Supreme Court rulings and legislative tussles broke out with Democrats over damages and liability in negligence cases. "Once businesses get sued, they get more concerned," said Jim Pugh of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce. He argues that legal reform is widely desired by business, but overshadowed by taxation and spending concerns: "You have to look beyond surveys." So where does this leave us? In trying to tie the lawsuit reforms to job creation, Walker asserted the issue is "one of the most important factors" when businesses are deciding to expand or invest in Wisconsin. That’s a major overreach. He cited a series of national surveys, which show it’s a concern but lack Wisconsin data and don’t weigh how the concern stacks up against other issues. In the surveys of state businesses we found, lawsuit reform is on the radar screen -- but a blip behind taxes, regulation and other issues. We rate Walker’s claim False.

pomt-05165	"Before I was governor, tuition was skyrocketing and we stopped that. We capped and then we froze college tuition."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/18/george-allen/george-allen-says-he-froze-college-tuition-when-he/	U.S. Senate candidate George Allen says he put the brakes on rising college costs when he was governor from 1994 to 1998. "Before I was governor, tuition was skyrocketing, and we stopped that," Allen said in a May 25 debate between four candidates seeking the GOP Senate nomination. "We capped, and then we froze college tuition." Allen won the Republican primary on June 12 and will face Democrat Tim Kaine this fall. They are seeking to replace Democrat Jim Webb, who is not seeking a second Senate term. We wondered if the Allen administration really did put a lid on tuition. Allen, while making this claim, shared credit with the Democratic-controlled legislature that served with him. Dan Allen, a senior adviser to the campaign, pointed us to a July 2011 report from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. The study said that during the early 1990s, colleges and universities increased tuitions by double digits annually to compensate for state funding cuts made by the General Assembly and then-Gov. Doug Wilder to help balance the budget during a recession. Wilder, in his final budget proposal made during an improving economy in December 1993, urged the General Assembly to cap tuition and instructional fee increases for in-state students at 5 percent during the 1994-95 school year and 4 percent during 1995-96. Allen, who took office in January 1994, successfully urged the General Assembly go a step further and cap the increases at 3 percent during each of the next two school years. In 1996, as SCHEV notes, Allen and the General Assembly froze tuition and instructional fees entirely. The action did not apply to a number of other mandatory college costs, such as fees for athletic programs, health services and campus transportation. Lawmakers eased some of the burden on colleges by appropriating an additional $200 million for higher education. The Richmond Times-Dispatch in January 1998 reported that a strong economy during Allen’s term allowed him to finance the tuition freeze. State tax revenues grew by about 45 percent during his tenure. Allen, in his farewell budget, recommended freezing tuition through 2000. His successor, Republican Jim Gilmore, rolled back tuition and instructional fees by 20 percent for in-state students. When Allen arrived in the governor’s mansion during the 1993-94 academic year, the average tuition and instructional fees for full time, in-state undergraduate students at four-year colleges was $2,518, according to SCHEV’s historical tables. That rose to $2,717 in the 1995-1996 academic year and stayed at that level through 1997-1998, the last academic year of Allen’s term. Using inflation-adjusted figures based on 1992 dollars, the report shows the amount of tuition and instructional fees went from $2,383 in the 1993-94 academic year down to $2,320 in 1997-98. Even when other mandatory fees that were not subject freeze are added in, the college costs remained flat after being adjusted for inflation. Costs at two-year colleges showed the same trend: in-state tuition and instructional fees at those institutions were basically flat during Allen’s term. Our ruling Allen said that, as governor, he stopped soaring tuition costs by implementing a tuition freeze. Allen and the General Assembly did impose a freeze after tuition had risen sharply during the early 1990s recession. Allen had leeway to cap tuitions because a healthy economy during his term allowed lawmakers to increase state appropriations to colleges and universities. We rate Allen’s claim True.

pomt-05277	Says Obama broke his promise to help homeowners facing foreclosure.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/25/crossroads-gps/crossroads-ad-says-obama-has-failed-stem-foreclosu/	As the economic collapse began to threaten homeowners, presidential candidate Barack Obama vowed to come to their aid. "We must help the millions of homeowners facing foreclosure," he said on the campaign trail in June 2008. His plan called for changes in bankruptcy laws, a crackdown on predatory and fraudulent lenders and a $10 billion fund to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. With Obama seeking re-election in 2012, his record on the foreclosure crisis is under attack. The Republican group Crossroads GPS said in a recent television ad that Obama broke his promise to help struggling homeowners. The ad shows Obama saying he would help them and then stamps "BROKEN" on the screen. PolitiFact examined the Crossroads claim and found that, indeed, Obama has had limited success with his plans to ease the mortgage crisis. "I don't think there's much doubt, even within the administration, that the (foreclosure assistance) programs overpromised and underperformed -- embarrassingly so," said Ken Harney, who writes a weekly syndicated real estate column. 'They wimped out' During the 2008 campaign and his first few months in office, Obama promised a lot: ● $10 billion foreclosure prevention fund to help struggling homeowners ● Change in bankruptcy law to allow judges to modify mortgage loan terms ● Tax credits for struggling homeowners ● A crackdown on predatory and fraudulent lenders ● Better disclosure about mortgages to home-buyers ● A moratorium on foreclosures The results, experts say, have been mixed at best. Obama himself says the housing crisis is the most stubborn issue he has faced. "If we were not a capitalist economy, it would be very easy," said Ken Thomas, an independent bank analyst and economist in Miami. "We’re a market-regulated economy, we’re not a government-regulated economy. That makes it very hard for the government to do anything." The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, which Obama signed in 2009, makes it a federal crime to make a materially false statement on a mortgage application or to willfully overvalue a property to influence any action by a mortgage lending business. PolitiFact's Obameter gave that a Promise Kept. And new standards for helping people understand their mortgage were included in the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul passed in 2010, another Promise Kept. But he's had limited success with the promises that would have provided the biggest help to homeowners, according to five experts we interviewed. A temporary foreclosure moratorium happened in early 2009 as banks halted their filings while they waited for the new administration to get its plan in place to address the crisis. It’s not clear, though, that it ultimately kept many people out of foreclosure. Analysts say the change in bankruptcy law to allow judges to modify individual loans could have made a significant difference, but it died in Congress. "That sort of took the wind out of the program, in a way. If it had passed, it would have put much more fire under the feet of the mortgage servicers," said Alex Schwartz, a professor of urban policy at the New School and author of the book Housing Policy in the United States. Instead, he said, "you were left with voluntary participation of servicers." The foreclosure prevention fund was the heart of his promise. He originally pledged $10 billion but ended up setting aside $75 billion, using TARP funds. He predicted the money would assist 9 million homeowners. But after three years, only about 2 million people have won permanent mortgage help, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The two main programs were dubbed HAMP and HARP. Under the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, lenders were encouraged to restructure loans for borrowers who were struggling to pay. The banks received small payments from the government as incentive. The Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, aimed to help people refinance their loans at lower interest rates. "Everything has fallen short of original expectations," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s. Other experts agree. "Obama’s program was overly complicated, it was voluntary, it was at a retail level, requiring people to call in and work with individual servicers. It was a mess," Schwartz said. (On our Obameter, we've rated the foreclosure fund a Promise Broken because it fell far short of Obama's goal of helping 9 million homeowners.) Another shortcoming of the programs: The Obama administration did not require banks to include principal reduction in modifications. The programs allowed loan servicers to reduce loan balances, but it shocked no one when most banks opted not to. Making that a requirement would have gone a long way toward keeping people in their homes. "There’s a real risk that when people are so severely underwater, they could walk away from their mortgages," Schwartz said. "So you can make a strong case for principal reduction." Harney, the real estate columnist, also blamed the president for not flexing more political muscle with the banks. "At a time when the administration could have pushed the big TARP-recipient banks much harder on modifications, short sales and principal reductions, they wimped out," Harney said. "Whether the close connections between Wall Street and the new White House/Treasury staff got in the way of stronger designs, I don't know. The numbers speak for themselves." The landscape now Numbers about the foreclosure crisis show things have improved only slightly. According to RealtyTrac, a website that collects and tracks foreclosure data, about 150,000 new foreclosure suits were filed nationwide in January 2009, the month Obama took office. They peaked at 203,948 in April 2009 and didn’t dip below 100,000 in a single month until April 2011. And last month, another 97,000 new foreclosures were filed. Crossroads cites the high rate of underwater mortgages as evidence that Obama’s programs failed. In early 2008, the number of underwater homes was estimated at 9 million. RealtyTrac says the current total is 12 million, or 28 percent of all mortgages. But that statistic, sobering as it is, offers a poor gauge of Obama’s policies. Borrowers ended up in this situation because they took out high-priced mortgages and then their property values plummeted -- a market occurrence largely outside any president’s control. "It mostly reflects bad policy leading up to the crash," said Schwartz. "Policies that encouraged reckless mortgage underwriting, which inflated prices." Still, there are some signs of progress. Early this year, changes to HARP relaxed eligibility standards and extended the length of the program to the end of 2013. HAMP also was extended through next year. Schwartz said the programs were originally geared to subprime, high-risk mortgages. So as the recession worsened and people with more conventional mortgages lost jobs and income, the programs didn’t accommodate them. The new standards attempt to reach a bigger pool of homeowners, including people deeper underwater and those still in good standing on their loans. The Treasury Department recently announced that the number of active permanent mortgage loan modifications agreed to by banks rose 12,139 to 794,748 during March, the most recent timeframe available. The Obama campaign cited HUD data showing that HAMP has trimmed a median of $535 off monthly payments of mortgages that have been modified as evidence of progress. "I still think it’s meaningful and it’s helpful," Zandi said. "It’s just not as helpful as they had hoped for." It’s also worth noting that there were forces working against Obama amid these efforts. The Republican-controlled House, for one. "The Obama administration has been completely hamstrung by Congress, refusing to spend any money on stimulus," Schwartz said. The economy, for another. "They (the foreclosure programs) haven’t been as effective as hoped and the reason is because a lot of the foreclosures were triggered by the 8 million-plus loss in jobs," said Norm Miller, an economist, financial analyst and professor at the University of San Diego. Our ruling The Crossroads GPS ad said Obama has broken his promise to help millions of people facing foreclosure. "Help" is a vague notion, and there’s certainly no doubt that the president has tried several avenues to stem the tide of home loan defaults. But there’s also no doubt that his efforts have fallen far short of expectations -- and even the benchmarks he set for himself. Two primary programs aimed at helping people keep their homes -- HAMP and HARP -- have reached more households in recent months, but they are unlikely to ever help the 9 million homeowners Obama said he would assist. And it’s reasonable that he could have leaned harder on lenders to produce better results in the aftermath of multi-billion-dollar bank bailouts. Although Obama’s efforts haven’t been the utter failure Crossroads suggests, there are still millions of struggling homeowners who need help in the ongoing foreclosure crisis. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True. Update: This item has been updated to correct that Republicans control the House of Representatives rather than the entire Congress.

pomt-12468	"Bill O’Reilly in critical condition after being attacked by ‘tolerant’ liberals."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/05/blog-posting/fake-news-says-bill-oreilly-beaten-unconscious-lib/	Ousted Fox News host Bill O’Reilly had already taken a drubbing over sexual harassment allegations, but fake news purveyors then started circulating a false story that he’d been beaten unconscious, too. "Bill O’Reilly in critical condition after being attacked by ‘tolerant’ liberals," read a headline on a May 4, 2017, story at DailyUSAUpdate.com. We found the story posted on other websites, as well. The article was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to winnow fake news from users’ news feeds. The post — which again, is fake — said O’Reilly was buying bagels in New York when three men and two women began complaining about his treatment of women. O’Reilly was forced off Fox News Channel on April 19 and lost his show, The O’Reilly Factor, after multiple reports of sexual harassment. The New York Times had reported the network paid about $13 million to settle claims. The confrontation turned aggressive when the liberals (as identified in the story) attacked O’Reilly, dragging him into the street and kicking him until "until he was unconscious and bleeding." The attackers ran off, the post said, leaving O’Reilly with four broken ribs and a punctured lung. He possibly suffered "a cardiac event," the story said. Except none of the details about an attack are true. There is no apparent way to contact DailyUSAUpdate.com administrators, who have hidden the site’s registration information. There were no reports from legitimate media sources that this event occurred, in any case. Surely such an attack would have been widely covered. The hoax came about a week after other reports that Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident and Sarah Palin had been run off the road and was in a coma. The fake O’Reilly story originally came from TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." And that’s what we call this fake report — baloney. Actually, we rate it Pants On Fire!	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-05-05T15:51:01	2017-05-04	['None']
pomt-08415	The Seattle Times called Patty Murray "a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.' Patty even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.' "	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/20/dino-rossi/earmark-attack-patty-murray-rings-true/	The race for the Senate in Washington pits Republican businessman Dino Rossi against Democratic incumbent Patty Murray. Rossi says he wants to reduce government spending and debt, and he's issued an attack ad against Murray on that point. "Has Washington, D.C., changed Patty Murray? She said she was elected to cut the budget. But now the Seattle Times called her a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.' Patty even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'" The ad also attacked her votes on bailing out the financial system and voting for President Barack Obama's health care law. Murray did vote for those bills. What we wanted to fact-check was whether the charges against Murray on earmarks are accurate. We'll take them in order. • "The Seattle Times called her a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.'" We often find that campaign ads take newspaper quotes out of context to present a misleading impression. But that's not the case here. The quote comes from a reported profile of Murray that ran on the newspaper's front page on Oct. 3, 2010. The article describes Murray as a hard worker who presents issues in common terms that people can understand and a congenial legislator who is willing to work with Republicans to get things done. But she is not known for authoring major legislation or giving lofty speeches. Instead, her seat on the Appropriations Committee has been the springboard for her accomplishments, according to the story. "Her keenest impact has come from tapping federal coffers to benefit workers and programs. "She has helped direct federal money to build Sound Transit light rail, clean up the Hanford nuclear reservation, repair the Howard Hanson Dam, pay for ferries and construct and repair countless miles of roads. She also has funneled billions of dollars to veterans, who have few better advocates in Congress." The story concludes by noting Murray's penchant for earmarks. "Perhaps Murray's starkest transformation has been her emergence as an unapologetic -- at times even defiant -- dispenser of federal dollars. "During her first year in the Senate, she defended her frequent votes to reduce the Clinton administration's spending requests by saying, 'I wasn't elected to bring home the bacon. I was elected to cut the budget.' "Murray since has become a prolific sponsor of earmarks, grants awarded at the behest of individual lawmakers to favored groups and companies. Her office churns out seemingly ceaseless news releases touting millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars she helped win for projects in Washington state. "The question for Murray now is how her brand of purse-string politics will play out with an electorate squeezed by the worst recession in 80 years." So Rossi's use of the quote in his ad is a fair excerpt of news coverage. Additionally, we checked with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group that works to publicize and reduce earmarks, on Murray's record. Its 2010 database of earmarks showed Murray won or helped win 187 earmarks worth $219.5 million. Out of 100 senators ranked for the amount of earmark money they garnered, Murray ranked ninth. • "Patty even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'" Ah, the Bridge to Nowhere. It was a 2005 project that brought infamy to earmarks: The Alaska bridge was intended to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport, at a cost of nearly $400 million. Taxpayers for Common Sense derisively nicknamed the earmark the Bridge to Nowhere, and it became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. Faced with an uproar, a congressional committee directed that the $225 million earmarked for the bridge be sent to the Alaska Department of Transportation without stipulating that it be used for the bridge. It didn't get built, but the bridge was still an issue in the 2008 election. (We reported fact-checks about how Barack Obama voted on it as a senator and how Sarah Palin handled it as Alaska governor.) The question for us now is, did Murray defend the bridge earmark? News stories led us to the Congressional Record and a series of debates that took place on the Senate floor on Oct. 20, 2005. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., an opponent of the earmark process, decided to highlight the bridge and other earmarks by proposing a series of amendments that would send the money for those projects to other projects intended to help the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. One of the projects was the Alaska bridge; another was an earmark for a sculpture park for Seattle, Wash. "Let us find our will," Coburn said. "No more low-priority projects in the face of half-trillion-dollar deficits, no more exorbitant bridges to nowhere. Speaking of bridges, that is where this Congress will be, on a bridge to nowhere if we do not gain control of ourselves." Murray responded on the Senate floor to oppose all of Coburn's amendments, offering a no-holds-barred defense. Murray said that senators knew better than "bureaucrats sitting in Washington, D.C." about what projects needed funding in states around the country. "I am out in every community, talking to people, listening to them," Murray said. "It is my job to be their partner in that. I tell them that all the time. You get it going on the ground here, you develop the projects, you get the consensus within your own communities, and I will do what I can to get some small part of help from the federal government. That is how I, like most senators in the Senate, am sent projects. ... "Today, the senator from Oklahoma has targeted another project that I sat down and discussed with local community leaders. I didn't come up with this. This came from the heart of my local community because they are working very hard in an urban core in the city of Seattle to turn a brownfield into a hub of activity. It is a project that is stimulating jobs and investments," Murray said. "If the senator from Oklahoma wants to look for a culprit for the fiscal situation in this country, he should look into the billions and billions of dollars in tax cuts that have been granted to multimillionaires in this country, and he should look at additional tax cuts his party wants to implement in future years if he wants to find incredible savings." Murray didn't mention the Alaska bridge, but she said she opposed his amendment for the Seattle project as well as "the numerous other amendments he has filed with the same type of philosophy, as he calls it, in the Senate." That would logically include the Alaska bridge project, which was being discussed. "I hope the Senate will not go down the road of cherry-picking individual projects that senators have come to us and have championed on behalf of their constituents who do not live here in Washington, D.C.," Murray said. "I hope we do not go down the road deciding we know better than home state senators about the merits of the projects they bring to us." Coburn, we should note, disagreed with Murray's logic that earmarks are a needed corrective for too much bureaucracy. "If we have a problem with the bureaucracy, we have all the power in the world to change that. We have the power right here to change that," Coburn said. "So we can either change the bureaucracy so it reflects the views of the people of this country, or we can go about it the wrong way and have to control it by taking a very small percentage of the budget. We get two bad results from that. We get poor priorities. And, No. 2, we are not doing our job in controlling the bureaucracy." We should note that we called and e-mailed both the Rossi and Murray campaigns about this ad, but didn't hear back from either campaign. Getting back to our ruling, we're checking two points here about earmarks. Rossi's ad said that the Seattle Times called her a 'prolific sponsor of earmarks.' " That comes from a reported story and is a fair summary of one of the points in the story, and it's a fair summary of the newspaper's findings on Murray's record on earmarks. The ad also said Murray "even defended the 'Bridge to Nowhere.'" Murray didn't specifically defend that project, although it was very clear that she felt like the bridge and other earmarks being discussed on the Senate floor should be left alone. We find Rossi's statements Mostly True.	None	Dino Rossi	None	None	None	2010-10-20T13:23:45	2010-10-12	['Patty_Murray']
pomt-07872	Most state employees could pay twice as much toward their health care premiums and it would still be half the national average	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/08/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-state-employees-co/	Gov. Scott Walker left no doubt in his first "state of the state" address that he wants benefits concessions from state employees. Walker said state employees need to share the pain felt by private-sector workers so the state can balance its budget without tax increases. In making his case, he tossed out some stark statistics on pensions and health care coverage: "Most state workers only pay about 6 percent of their premium costs for their health care plan," Walker told lawmakers. "Asking public employees to make...a premium payment of 12 percent, which is about half of the national average, would save the state more than $30 million over three months." He added: "Most workers outside of government would love a deal like that – particularly if it means saving jobs." We set out to test the governor’s claim. Walker press secretary Cullen Werwie pointed to a Kaiser Family Foundation study that employees nationally -- public and private -- pay an average of 29 percent of the cost of the premiums. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported those findings on Sept. 12, 2010. Werwie also provided state documents showing the premium contribution by union and non-union state workers, as well as the total premium cost to the state. He said they show that most state employees pay between 4 percent and 6 percent. Let’s dig into both sides of the equation. First, is Walker correct that "most" state employees pay only about 6 percent? Unionized state workers in the most common insurance tier pay $78 a month on family premiums that cost the state between $1,500 and $1,800, state figures show. That’s in the 4 percent to 5 percent range by our calculation. Non-union state workers pay a bit more -- $89 a month in most cases. That works out to a 5 percent to 6 percent share. So Walker’s number looks good. And so does the "most state employees" claim: More than 98 percent of state employees fall into those categories, according to figures from the state’s Department of Employee Trust Funds. There is a higher-premium plan in which some state employees pay about 15 percent of the cost, or $412 a month. But it is used by just a tiny fraction of state government workers. Just to cap this off, we asked the state to calculate the employee share across all plans, both single and family coverage, for all employees. They came up with 5.6 percent. Now the national side. First, a bit of background. The national cost trend is clear. Since 2000, average premiums for family coverage have increased 114 percent, the Kaiser study found. Several other studies back up Walker’s claim on the national numbers regarding public and private employees. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010 health care benefits survey put the employee share at 32 percent for family coverage. It’s 21 percent for single coverage. Of course, there is a range, but that’s the collective national figure for civilian workers, public and private. Union workers paid much less than non-represented workers. Now let’s tease out just government workers, to see how Wisconsin compares there. The Kaiser study -- the one relied on by Walker for his overall comparison -- put the employee share paid by state and local government workers nationwide at 25 percent for family coverage. Finally, a study by The Segal Co., a private benefits firm, that looked just at state government workers showed a majority paying between 20 percent and 60 percent of their premium costs for family coverage. If Wisconsin workers are paying around 6 percent, that puts them in the bottom fifth nationally among state employees, Segal’s data shows. A very small number pay zero toward their premium. There’s a clear trend toward asking state employees to pay more, the Segal study said. Still, private-sector workers are being asked to share even more, said J. Richard Johnson, Segal’s public sector health practice leader. Experts warn against drawing comparisons without looking at employees’ total package of wages and benefits -- and what they may have given up to get them. (We examined another aspect of that in an earlier item on public vs. private sector pay.) So in this item we’re not trying to determine where Wisconsin workers stand in the big picture. But we can come to a firm conclusion on the state employee health premiums, here and nationally. The governor relies on a statistic that mixes public and private workers, but in this case that’s not a problem: Walker’s point is that state workers need to be more in line with their private counterparts. Walker’s numbers for state workers and the national context are right on target. And his math holds up even when the comparison is narrowed to just public employees. We rate his statement True.

pomt-05020	"New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that’s good. And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/16/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-new-jersey-has-reduced-numbe/	A fresh batch of labor statistics is sending a recycled claim from Gov. Chris Christie to the bottom end of the Truth-O-Meter. The Republican governor last week repeated a claim about how there are fewer "state government" employees now than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman resigned in January 2001. Better yet, the state accomplished that reduction "without any layoffs," Christie said. "New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that’s good," Christie said in a July 9 appearance at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. "And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition." PolitiFact New Jersey issued a True ruling in December on Christie’s claim about how state government has fewer employees than when Whitman resigned. But when we looked at recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that the governor’s statement is no longer accurate. Christie’s claim about there being no layoffs is wrong too, because his representatives previously cited hundreds of layoffs during his tenure. First, let’s explain what’s changed since our True ruling. At the time of that ruling, the latest numbers were preliminary estimates for November 2011, showing 137,800 "state government" workers. That figure represented 600 fewer employees than the 138,400 state workers in January 2001. But the November figures have since been revised to show 144,300 workers in that month, exceeding the estimate from January 2001. Every month since November also has shown a greater number of employees than when Whitman resigned. When Christie repeated the claim last week, the latest figures were preliminary estimates for May 2012, when there were 146,100 state government employees. That represents a 7,700 increase, or nearly 5.6 percent, over Whitman’s final month. Those statistics are seasonally adjusted and include workers in state departments; the legislative and judicial branches; state colleges and universities; state hospitals and state authorities and commissions, such as NJ Transit. Brian Murray, a spokesman with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, acknowledged how "the Bureau of Labor Statistics has since revised the data and shifted the estimated count of state employees higher." But Murray also pointed to a reduction in employees since the Whitman era in the subcategory of "other state government," which includes the executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as state boards and authorities. "It could be argued that the Governor has more day-to-day control over the workforces in the items included in ‘other state government’ rather than Educational Services and hospitals," Murray said in an e-mail. However, in both claims, Christie has just referred to "state government" in general. Also, when we referred to that overall category for our first fact-check, a Christie spokesman confirmed that was the source of the governor’s information. So, for this fact-check, we’re focusing on the same category. It’s worth noting that since Christie took office in January 2010, the number of "state government" employees has dropped by 5,600, or nearly 3.7 percent. But has the Christie administration reduced the state workforce "without any layoffs"? That’s not what the governor’s representatives told us in December when we were working on our first fact-check. Between the start of Christie’s tenure and November 2011, "743 out of 4,738 full-time positions eliminated were through layoffs," the spokesmen said in an e-mail, referring to the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Those layoffs included 138 positions at the New Jersey Network, the state-owned TV network shut down at the end of June 2011. Our ruling At the Brookings Institution, Christie claimed: "New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that’s good. And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition." But the latest labor statistics show there were 7,700 more "state government" workers in May than when Whitman resigned. Also, the governor’s representatives have cited hundreds of layoffs during Christie’s tenure. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11138	"We got $6 billion for opioid and getting rid of that scourge that’s taking over our country. And the numbers are way down."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-opioid-numbers-way-dow/	In his speech to rally support for Tennessee Republicans, President Donald Trump spoke briefly about progress in the fight against the opioid crisis. He remarked on the new money approved in the latest congressional spending bill. "We got $6 billion for opioid and getting rid of the scourge that’s taking over our country," Trump said May 29. "And the numbers are way down." "We’re getting the word out — bad. Bad stuff. You go to the hospital, you have a broken arm, you come out, you’re a drug addict with this crap. It’s way down. We’re doing a good job with it. But we got $6 billion to help us with opioid." We wondered what opioid numbers he was talking about, and whether they are really "way down." The White House cited an article about the decline in the number of opioid prescriptions. But the reduction in prescriptions might mean less than it seems, and opioid deaths remain high. Reporting on a study from a health data firm, an April 19 Washington Post article said the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies (measured in morphine equivalents) dropped 10 percent in 2017. The study by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science suggested that public outrage over over-prescribing had led to restraint by physicians. But a drop in opioid prescriptions isn’t a guaranteed sign of progress. A review of studies of prescription monitoring programs published in the Indiana Health Law Review found that about one-third of the time, these efforts take place in states where overdoses rose after the programs expanded. In West Virginia, for example, even with a "significant drop in opioids dispensed" between 2008 and 2015, the number of heroin poisonings doubled. "Fewer prescriptions have not translated into lower overdoses," said the article's author Northeastern University opioid researcher Leo Beletsky. "Quite the opposite." As for Trump’s statement that the numbers are "way down," the government’s most recent statistics through October 2017 show a rise in overdose deaths from the year before. For all opioids, including illegal and prescription drugs, deaths were up 15 percent. For the synthetic opioids alone, such as fentanyl, deaths were up 57 percent. Deaths from prescription painkillers such as oxycodone (the natural/semi-synthetic category) rose by a small fraction. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The only possible bright spot in the numbers is that while the death toll continues to rise, it rose at a slower rate than the year before. The timing of the funding increase Trump mentioned also undercuts his claim. The appropriations bill that provided $6 billion to federal, state and local agencies to turn back the opioid crisis became law at the end of March. It is dubious to argue that this money flowed quickly enough to have a measurable impact on the opioid problem, especially since the total amount would come over two years. Our ruling Trump said that in the opioid crisis, "the numbers are way down." One study shows a 10 percent decline in the the number of opioid prescriptions at retail pharmacies. However, the latest government figures show a 15 percent increase in opioid overdose deaths between 2016 and 2017. And research casts doubt on the tie between reduced prescribing and a drop in the number of overdoses. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07901	"Despite claims that you can 'keep the health care plan you like,' the Obama Administration has predicted that as many as 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/02/blake-farenthold/rep-blake-farenthold-says-health-care-law-will-for/	On Jan. 23, 2011, Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas -- a freshman lawmaker who ousted a Democratic incumbent in 2010 -- wrote an op-ed in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times explaining his decision to vote to repeal the Democratic-backed health care law. One of the reasons he cited was this: "Despite claims that you can 'keep the health care plan you like,' the Obama administration has predicted that as many as 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan," Farenthold wrote. Farenthold was referring to President Barack Obama’s frequent claim that under the proposed law, "if you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan." We fact-checked that claim in 2009 -- before the final version of the bill was passed -- and ruled it Half True. Later that year, Obama began using a less sweeping version of the claim -- that if you "already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have." We rated that statement True. When we saw Farenthold’s statement, we wondered whether the Obama administration really acknowledged that "as many as 7 out of 10 Americans with employer-provided health coverage could lose their current health plan." We tried contacting Farenthold’s office, but his staff did not respond to our inquiries. However, Michael Tanner -- a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, which has been critical of the health care bill -- suggested that Farenthold may have been referring to a fact sheet the administration assembled and posted at the informational website HealthCare.gov. This fact sheet explained how health plans can be "grandfathered" under the law, which was passed in early 2010 and which becomes fully operational in 2014. The law allows plans that existed on March 23, 2010, to be "grandfathered," which means that they do not have to comply with new provisions that took effect last fall, such as requirements to provide preventive services without cost-sharing and direct access to ob-gyn care without a referral. To keep their grandfathered status, these plans must not significantly cut benefits or increase out-of-pocket spending for consumers. (Minor policy changes and increases to keep pace with medical inflation do not threaten a plan’s grandfather status.) While acknowledging significant uncertainty about how employers will react to their options, the fact sheet offers estimates of how many plans the administration expects to opt for grandfathered status, both for the 133 million Americans whose plans are provided by large employers and the 43 million with plans provided by small employers (fewer than 100 employees). We aren’t looking at the nation’s 17 million individually purchased policies, because Farenthold’s claim specifically referenced employer-provided health care. According to administration projections, between 71 and 87 percent of large-employer plans will be grandfathered in 2011, and between 36 and 66 percent will remain grandfathered by 2013. For small plans, the administration expects between 58 and 80 percent to be grandfathered in 2011 and between 20 and 51 percent to be grandfathered in 2013. So, in his op-ed, Farenthold used the highest estimate for the percentage of plans that will have lost their grandfather status by 2013 and therefore changed to comply with the health care law, though he does hedge somewhat by saying "as many as." Still, we don’t think these numbers fully support Farenthold’s claim. For one thing, if your plan loses its grandfather status, it won’t necessarily mean that you’ll "lose (your) current health plan," as Farenthold writes. Health care specialists said they expect that in many cases an employer (or the insurance carrier the employer uses) will change the plan in ways that are significant enough to end grandfather status but which will not terminate the plan or result in a radical change in its coverage. While some employers may decide to end health care coverage entirely (and thus pay a penalty under the bill), many will continue to offer a similar plan but perhaps with more extensive requirements mandated under the law, possibly along with higher premiums. Indeed, one way that your employer’s plan could lose its grandfather status would be if the employer decides to make it more generous to patients. In this case, "losing" the plan would be a net gain for the patient, not a net loss. This is certainly how supporters view the law -- they see the shift from a grandfathered plan to one with new patient benefits and protections as a good thing, not a bad thing. Opponents counter that un-grandfathered plans will force patients to pay more even if they don’t want the new benefits. There’s also a broader issue. Saying that the law could force 70 percent of Americans to lose their current health plans ignores that many people lose their current health coverage every year for reasons having nothing to do with the new law. Both Obama and Farenthold failed to acknowledge this point, but more on that in a moment. Answering the question of how many Americans "lose their current health plan" for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law is surprisingly tricky. Health care experts we contacted said they’d never seen a comprehensive statistical look at that question, so we pieced it together as best we could. We found one study by the U.S. Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation, which looked at a statistically representative sample of Americans over a period of 48 months. Unfortunately, the data is old -- it’s from the mid-to-late 1990s -- but one finding was that 26.3 percent of fully employed Americans lacked health coverage for at least one month in the 48-month period studied. That statistic only addresses people who lost coverage entirely, at least temporarily. It doesn’t include people who switched jobs (and thus health plans) without losing coverage. That’s common in an economy as dynamic as the United States’. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that, on average, slightly more than 3 percent of employees leave their jobs in any given month. The Census Bureau study also didn’t count those who stayed in the same job but whose company changed insurance carriers, or whose insurance carriers changed the terms of a client company’s plan. Data on this phenomenon is scarce. We found some data in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population "switched" health insurance coverage. However, this probably underestimates the rate of switching for the people Farenthold was referring to -- those who have employer-based coverage. The HHS study included people of all ages, including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch. In addition, the study would capture a switch between, say, an Aetna plan and a United Health Care plan but would not necessarily catch a shift between one type of Aetna plan and another type of Aetna plan. We found another relevant study by Mercer, a private consulting firm. Mercer's National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans, an annual study of nearly 3,000 employers released every November, includes a question on whether employers will ask employees to pay a greater share of health care costs in the upcoming plan year -- for instance, by changing from an HMO to a PPO or by raising deductibles and other forms of cost-sharing. Beth Umland, the head of research for Mercer's health & benefits consulting practice, said that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly 25 percent of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, she said, that percentage rose to one-third of companies each year. So if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely, who change jobs, who work for companies that change insurance carriers or plan terms significantly, or whose employer’s insurance carrier is merged or bought out, a significant number of Americans were already losing "their current health plan" before the new law was passed. The data is too scattershot to know how large or small the percentage is, but it seems reasonable to assume that the number is not trivial. In fact, the percentage could well be higher than the administration's lower- to mid-level projections for de-grandfathering. Why does this matter? Because knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans -- even if they like them -- would provide a different impression of the statistics Farenthold cites. And this confusion owes a lot to Obama’s original promise. When Obama said, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan," he never acknowledged that many working Americans were already unable to keep the same coverage every year. That set up an unrealistic perception of what the health care bill would do -- and it gave his opponents a perfect opportunity to make the bill’s impact seem problematic. Later he modified the claim to say that if you "already have health insurance through your job, Medicare, Medicaid or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor that you have." But by the time Obama changed how he made this point, it was already too late -- his opponents had seized on the initial comment and cited it repeatedly. That said, this item is about Farenthold’s claim, not Obama’s, and we find problems with it. If Farenthold is using the administration’s estimates for lost grandfather status, he’s taken the most extreme point on a wide range of possible outcomes. More important, it’s not clear that an employee whose plan loses grandfather status would be losing his current health plan in anything more than a technical sense; many workers could actually end up with a more generous plan. Finally, Farenthold ignores that many employees lose their current health plans for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the health care law. To suggest that the law is the reason for 70 percent of employees being forced off their plans, as Farenthold does, ignores all other reasons for such changes. And he is incorrect when he says the Obama administration predicted that. We rate the statement False. UPDATE: Shortly after our story was published, Farenthold’s office replied to our inquiry. They confirmed that the Congressman was referring to the administration’s projected rates of grandfathering, specifically citing Table 3 in the official regulation. We stand by our ruling.

pomt-04588	"Their New York casino deal was called ‘rigged’ and ‘corrupt.’"	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/21/its-still-bad-idea/was-grange-investor-part-new-york-casino-deal-call/	The people opposed to a private casino in Wood Village came out swinging in their first campaign ad. They renamed the Grange casino complex the "Grunge" and branded Canadian backers Clairvest as foreigners. Not only that, but the TV spot claims that casino backers would bring "a history of scandal and crime" to Oregon. As evidence, they point to a failed New York venture in 2010. "Their New York casino deal was called rigged and corrupt," says the television announcer, while on screen the words "rigged" and "corrupt" appear with the masthead for the "New York Post" daily newspaper tabloid. The campaign ad prompted one question for PolitiFact Oregon: What happened in New York? We need to introduce the players for those not following the campaign. The Grange is a $300 million entertainment and casino complex to be built at the old greyhound racing track in Wood Village if state voters approve Measures 82 and 83. Running the opposition campaign is the It’s Still a Bad Idea Committee, funded largely with money from tribes that could lose a lot of money should a private casino compete with their tribal casinos. The owner and operator of The Grange would be PDX Entertainment Company, but the big money backers are Clairvest Groupand the Great Canadian Gaming Corporation. Both are based in Canada and operate multiple casinos. Clairvest previously had served as the primary financial backer on a race track casino project in Queens, New York, as part of the Aqueduct Entertainment Group consortium. AEG was awarded the contract in 2010 despite having the lowest up-front money bid. The offer was rescinded under media scrutiny. The deal fell apart. Michael Goodwin, a political columnist for The New York Post, wrote about the unraveling in a March 10, 2010, column. It is from this column that the words "corrupt" and "rigged" were taken for the ad, and as we usually do, we hunted down the source. Here are the relevant parts: "The lucrative contract for video slots at the raceway looked and smelled corrupt from the start, and yesterday’s strange developments do nothing to dispel the suspicions," Goodwin wrote. "In fact, the failure by the winning team to finish its application on time and the withdrawals of the Rev. Floyd Flake and rap star Jay-Z from the group adds to the suspicions the process was rigged." The state inspector general’s office weighed in on the whole tangled, tarnished process with a hefty investigative report in October 2010. The report described the bidding process as chaotic, lacking clear rules. The report criticized lawmakers and state officials, especially Senate Democratic leader John Sampson, who shared competitive information with AEG and apparently pressured its lobbyists for campaign contributions, which it made. No criminal charges were filed. Anna Richter Taylor, a spokeswoman for the casino project in Wood Village, said it’s not fair for opponents to taint the Oregon project "by linking it with headlines from a project that Clairvest, one of our many investors, was involved in back east." She added, "The investigation revealed New York politicians trying to shake down participants in their legislative process. Thankfully Oregon is not New York." But Cynara Lilly, a spokeswoman for casino opponents, said voters shouldn’t minimize the role of Clairvest now or in the past. "That they now have partners doesn't negate the importance of their record." We have to agree with Lilly. Clairvest is a major player in the Wood Village casino, with co-CEO Jeff Parr now serving as a director of PDX Entertainment Company. While the words "corrupt" and "rigged" are the opinions of a columnist and not legal findings, the New York inspector general’s report made it clear that Clairvest-backed AEG engaged in dubious activities in an attempt to win the contract. The columnist wrote that "the lucrative contract … looked and smelled corrupt" and that there were "suspicions the process was rigged." Driving the problems were lawmakers -- but that doesn’t exonerate Clairvest, which financed AEG, from paying to play. Does that mean Clairvest will bring problems to Oregon? We can’t make that link, and neither can casino opponents. But opponents can say with accuracy that "their New York casino deal was called rigged and corrupt." The only additional information we’d offer is the abhorrent behavior of the others involved. We rule the statement Mostly True.

pomt-15297	The murder rate in Atlanta is on the rise this year.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/22/atlanta-neighborhood-association/increase-murders-atlanta/	Crime is always the sort of news that attracts headlines. Now it’s also generating posts in online forums, where one neighborhood association alerted Atlanta residents that the city’s murder rate was spiking and had even reached a 50 percent increase from a year ago. PolitiFact Georgia couldn’t resist when an alert reader asked us to check it out. After all, the number of murders in several big cities is on the rise nationwide, after years of decline. That includes cities with populations close to those of Atlanta’s roughly 450,000 residents. For instance, through the first half of the year, Milwaukee (population 600,000) has seen a 105 percent surge in its homicide rate and the rate is up by 33 percent or more in Baltimore (about 620,000 residents) and St. Louis (about 320,000) And in Atlanta? According to the Atlanta Police Department website, the rate was up 16 percent in the first half of the year. Through July 11, the most recent date available, there have been 52 murders in the city. During the same time last year, there were 42 murders – a 24 percent increase. So while the increase is not as dramatic as suggested in the neighborhood forum or compared to similar cities, the rate is up. But the rates fluctuate wildly per week, which is how the police department reports all crimes. So it did appear that Atlanta had a serious surge of murders for the week ending May 23, or the 21st week of the year. Then, the homicide rate was up 54 percent at the time (40 murders at that point this year versus 26 last year). Then again, the city went without any murders for three weeks this year, between March 15 and April 2. And that spike in Week 21 was followed by no homicides in Week 22, the data show. In fact, the city had no murders at again for another multi-day run, between June 10 and June 20. "These numbers are very fluid," said Atlanta Police Capt. Michael O’Connor, who serves as the department Homicide Commander. So while brass are concerned that the rate is up and in theory on pace to be above 100 annual murders for the first time in years, "it’s very difficult to trend to know where you are going to finish the year." Criminologists support that analysis – and lack of analysis that can be done. To some extent, after years of declining murder rates, an increase can be little more than a statistical blip to get closer to a median. But without minimizing the loss of 52 lives, there isn’t much statistical analysis that can be done with such a relatively low number, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor of criminology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. For instance, only two women have been reported murder victims in Atlanta this year. While that may suggest the city has a better handle on domestic violence murders, a single such death could skew the data to suggest the exact opposite. "You don’t want to jump to a lot of conclusions," Kenney said. "If homicides are up, you are not necessarily at greater risk because we don’t randomly select our murder victims." That is, there are some people more at risk to be victims than others. Broadly speaking, that tends to be young men, especially men of color. Atlanta Police have just begun sifting through its first-half data to compare victims, perpetrators and scenarios to see just where the greatest risks lie, O’Connor said. Police do that constantly, targeting for instance a specific neighborhood or specific gang that may be making trouble. Putting a larger number of victims and suspect pool up for comparison should help analysts see if anything stands out that will help insert police sooner into the equation – and hopefully prevent some deaths, O’Connor said. It also will provide Atlanta Police Chief George Turner with some information to share with his counterparts at the Major Cities Chiefs Association on Gun Violence Summit, being held in Washington, D.C. next month. Such events are often heavy on anecdotes, Kenney said, but can provide the start of understanding crime trends. "When you can see a general increase virtually everywhere, that suggests crime is up but doesn’t tell you anything about why or what to do about it," he said. "Still, the police have to anticipate what they can so they can refocus their energies, and they seem to be doing that." Our ruling A neighborhood association alerted Atlanta residents that the city’s homicide rate is up for the year and has even reached a 50 percent increase. At one point, the murder rate did spike that high, though with weekly fluctuations, the year-to-date rate is up about a quarter from this time last year. That puts Atlanta in line with other cities seeing an increase in their murder rates. There is little conclusion on what might be driving the rate, or even if different cities share the same causes. But a 24 percent increase is cause for notice. We rate the claim True.	None	Atlanta neighborhood association	None	None	None	2015-07-22T00:00:00	2015-07-09	['Atlanta']
pomt-01295	"The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/30/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-us-added-jobs-twice-wisconsins-rat/	Introducing President Barack Obama in Milwaukee, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke touted economic growth nationwide when compared to that in Wisconsin under Gov. Scott Walker: "The nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker." Asked to back up the claim, the Burke campaign pointed us to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ quarterly employment surveys. That data is considered the most reliable measure of jobs, though it is less timely than that from separate monthly employment surveys. The campaign told us the statistics show U.S. growth at "nearly twice the rate" of Wisconsin. Burke, though, was more definitive at the rally, saying "two times the rate." Burke’s phrasing of the talking point has changed. In early 2014, she said the latest data from the quarterly surveys showed the national rate was "nearly double" Wisconsin’s rate. At that point, she quoted a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story that came to the same conclusion after Wisconsin reported 1 percent growth compared with 1.9% nationally from June 2012 to June 2013. At the time, that was the latest available data, due to the lag time in the release of the detailed quarterly numbers, We crunched the same numbers the Burke campaign cited, examining private-sector employment, which has been the central focus of both candidates’ plans. Figures show that from the start of Walker’s term to the end of his third year, the national gain was 6.6 percent compared to Wisconsin’s 4.1 percent. That meant the U.S. growth was 1.6 times that of Wisconsin’s. In the most recent year (March 2013 to March 2014), Wisconsin’s growth rate was 1.3 percent, compared with the U.S. rate of 2.1 percent. Same result: the national rate was 1.6 times better. As we examined year-over-year growth at different quarterly vantage points, we repeatedly saw growth 1.6 to 1.7 times larger for the national figures. (We also looked at results from another government jobs survey, the monthly reports. They are more up to date -- through September 2014 -- but less reliable. They, too, show, national growth at 1.6 times the state’s, from the start of Walker’s term.) There were some smaller and larger differences at various points along the way. Annual growth rates in the United States in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and into early 2014 ranged from 1.2 to 2 times larger than Wisconsin’s. The high point was from September 2011 to September 2012, when the rate was twice that of Wisconsin. Our rating Burke claimed that "the nation as a whole has created jobs at a rate that is two times the rate that we have created jobs here in Wisconsin under Gov. Walker." Wisconsin lags behind the nation significantly, but for the most part quite not as badly as Burke says, based on the last year and on results from most of Walker’s term. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-09930	In Texas, "the No. 1 name for new male babies — many of whom will vote one day — is Jose."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/15/mike-murphy/jose-no-1-baby-name-texas-social-security-administ/	It's not unusual for a minority party to engage in soul-searching, finger-pointing and general agonizing over why it lost power. The Republican Party is in the midst of such a process right now. Mike Murphy, a GOP political strategist, has argued that the Republicans need to address why they lost so badly among two demographics: the young and Latinos. Obama crushed McCain among Hispanic voters by a 35-point margin, Murphy wrote in a column in Time magazine. "By 2030, the Latino share of the vote is likely to double," Murphy wrote. "In Texas, the crucial buckle for the GOP's Electoral College belt, the No. 1 name for new male babies — many of whom will vote one day — is Jose." Murphy added, "Latinos need to see a quick end to the Republican congressional jihad on immigration," Murphy concluded, adding that they should support immigration reform with a path to citizenship. "Republicans should differentiate themselves from the left by heating up the lukewarm American melting pot with a firm insistence on learning English and a rejection of the silly excesses of identity politics." We were intrigued by his claim — which he repeated on Meet the Press on June 14 — that Jose was the No. 1 baby name for boys in Texas. We wondered if that could be proved with hard numbers or if it was mostly conjecture. It turns out that the Social Security Administration compiles baby names for infants born in the United States, based on applications for Social Security numbers. The administration includes a few caveats about the data — names are counted only when the year of birth, state, and gender are known, for example. But it's hard to think of a better source for name popularity. In 2008, the No. 1 name for a baby boy born in Texas was indeed Jose. (It's held the top spot since 1996.) Nationally, it was 41st. In Texas, Jose was followed by Jacob, Daniel, Christopher, Joshua, David, Angel, Ethan, Juan and Michael. In case you're wondering, that same year in Texas, the most popular name for a girl was Emily, followed by Isabella, Abigail, Emma, Madison, Sophia, Mia, Natalie, Ashley and Ava. We're not rating Murphy's political advice one way or the other. But the numbers confirm he had his facts right about Jose. We rate Murphy's statement True.

pomt-09691	Guantanamo Bay detainees will get the H1N1 vaccine.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/11/sean-hannity/hannity-says-h1n1-vaccines-will-be-given-gitmo-det/	The Obama administration's handling of the H1N1 vaccine has given conservatives plenty to complain about. First, the government got behind schedule with its massive vaccination plans. And then came reports that the Pentagon was planning to vaccinate the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sean Hannity complained of the hypocrisy on his Nov. 2, 2009, show. "So you were hoping to get the H1N1 vaccine," he said. "Well, if the vaccine hasn't reached a doctor's office near you, that might be because it's on its way to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. That's right. A military spokesman announced Gitmo detainees will receive the vaccine sometime this month. That's well before it's expected to be available to the public at large. Seems the Obama administration has its priorities straight. Doesn't it?" Given the confusion over the program -- and a White House denial about the Guantanamo vaccinations -- we decided to look into Hannity's claim. It all started on Oct. 30, when CNN ran a story quoting Maj. Diana R. Haynie, a spokeswoman for Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay, who said the Pentagon would be offering the H1N1 vaccines to people held at the camp. "Detainees at JTF Guantanamo are considered to be at higher risk and therefore they will be offered the H1N1 vaccination," she told CNN. "JTF Guantanamo conducts safe, humane, legal and transparent care and custody of detainees. As such, we must provide detainees the medical care necessary to maintain their health." The Associated Press ran a similar story on Nov. 2. The news sparked an onslaught of criticism from lawmakers of both parties. They said pregnant women, children and the elderly should have priority access to the limited supply of vaccines over the Guantanamo detainees. On Tuesday, Nov. 3, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a press briefing that, "There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there's no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo." But the same day, a Pentagon spokesman said that a shipment of vaccines would eventually be sent to the prison, although he said the detainees would get the vaccine only after it was given to active-duty troops, contractors and others working for the government. The most recent news reports say that about 300 vaccines arrived at the installation on Monday, Nov. 9. According to the Associated Press, it's unlikely those vaccines will be given to prisoners. Instead, they are meant for military personnel, contractors and U.S. workers at the base. "We have an obligation to provide for the health of [the detainees], but we're faced with a situation where we have a limited amount of vaccines at this time," Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told PolitiFact. Assuming there are enough supplies, the detainees would eventually be given the vaccine, he said. The White House told us that, to date, no prisoners have been vaccinated, but that priority for the vaccine would follow this order: U.S. forces, deployed health care workers (civilian and contractor), civilians, detainees and non-US Defense Department contractors. So, Hannity is correct. Current plans say that the vaccines will eventually be offered to the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We rate his claim True.

pomt-10623	"(My dad) used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/15/mitt-romney/dad-was-a-dinosaur-hunter/	Republican Mitt Romney, speaking from the campaign trail in Michigan, recalled his father's legacy as the owner of American Motors Corp. and the car that changed the industry. "But, you see, when I was growing up, the fact that we won the mileage championship year after year with the Rambler was a source of great pride for my dad," Romney said during an interview on the CBS Early Show . "He used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs." Romney used a similar line in February 2007 when he launched his presidential campaign in Michigan, where he was born. It's the kind of claim that could, in our current energy climate, be dismissed as rewritten history. Campaigning against gas-guzzling cars in the '50s? Really? And yet, this is not a case of inflated exuberance. George Romney took the helm at American Motors in 1954 and helped rescue the company from near financial ruin. He succeeded in large part on the sales of the Rambler, the first American compact car. In doing so, he had to sell the concept and value of a compact car. In 1958, he traveled 700,000 miles in his crusade against what he called "gas-guzzling dinosaurs," a reference to the large cars produced by Detroit's Big Three automakers. "Who wants to have a gas-guzzling dinosaur in his garage?" he told Time magazine in 1959, for a cover article that labeled George Romney "The Dinosaur Hunter." He is credited with coining the term, even though other automakers cast doubts on just how economical the Rambler really was. Still, the nickname, and the George Romney legend, took hold. It appeared in prominent obituaries after his death July 26, 1995. His youngest son, Mitt, gets it right.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2008-01-15T00:00:00	2008-01-14	['None']
pomt-02275	Says the Medicaid fraud rate in Virginia was "fact-checked" and found to be "0.47 percent."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/08/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-medicaid-fraud-rate-virginia-047-pe/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe says there’s not much fraud in Virginia’s Medicaid program. He offered a statistic to prove his point during a recent interview with WRVA radio host Jimmy Barrett. McAuliffe: "Well if you read the Richmond Times-Dispatch, I think it was yesterday, they did the political fact-check, and I give them credit for that. They answered the question. Do you know what the fraud rate is, Jimmy, in Virginia? Do you have any idea?" Barrett: "No what’s the fraud rate?" McAuliffe: "Well, you had one delegate going around saying it was 30 percent. It was fact-checked yesterday. Point-four-seven percent, less than half a percent. That’s the facts." Our ears perked for two reasons: 1) We had never written a fact-check that said the fraud rate of Virginia’s Medicaid program is 0.47 percent, and; 2) We thought it was high time to do that fact-check now. Brian Coy, a McAuliffe spokesman, said the governor erred when he cited a March 23 Truth-O-Meter as the source for the 0.47 percent figure. That article examined a claim by Del. Jimmie Massie, R-Henrico, that 30 percent of the state’s Medicaid program was "lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies." We rated the claim Mostly False, saying that no study has ever quantified the amount of fraud, waste and inefficiency in Virginia’s system. Coy said the governor made a simple mistake, conflating our story with a fraud figure his staff had just provided to him. So that brings us to the next matter: Is the Medicare fraud rate 0.47 percent in Virginia? It’s an important question because the General Assembly is divided over expanding eligibility for the program to an additional 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians under provisions of the Affordable Care Act. McAuliffe and the Democratic-controlled state Senate support the growth, noting that the federal government will pick up the entire tab for the next three years and 90 percent of the cost down the road. But the Republican-led House has twice rejected the expansion, maintaining, among other things, that Medicaid is rife with waste and should not be expanded before the abuse is curbed. The governor sought to refute the GOP argument by offering the 0.47 percent figure. But contrary to his statement, the statistic is not a measurement of Medicaid fraud. That figure is part of a "payment error rate measurement" compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It’s a computation of the percentage of Medicaid bills that were paid for services Virginians were ineligible to receive. Some of the errors result from fraud and some come from simple clerical mistakes. Each state’s error rate is examined every three years. "It is important to note the error rate is not a ‘fraud rate’ but simply a measurement of payments that did not meet statutory, regulatory or administrative requirements," the CMS says on its website. Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, sounded the same warning, "It’s not a very accurate indicator of fraud," he told us. "It’s not really set up to measure fraud." We should note Virginia, under this measurement, seems to perform well, Nationally, 3.3 percent of Medicaid payments go to services for ineligible people. But CMS discourages such comparisons, saying that the sample of bills reviewed from each state is small. There have been studies in recent years estimating as much as 30 percent of all healthcare spending across the nation is lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies. But the authors of those reports, as we pointed out in our story on Del. Massie’s claim, stress that their estimates don’t carry over to individual states, let alone the Medicaid program in any one state. Pinpointing Medicaid fraud rates is all but impossible. "Some (fraud) is found out eventually, but a lot of it, most of it, is never detected," explained Kip Piper, a former senior advisor to the Centers on Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Department of Medical Assistance Services, which oversees Virginia’s Medicaid system, does not try to calculate a fraud percentage. "There is no officially designated term or standardized metric to calculate a ‘fraud rate,’" Craig Markva, a DMAS spokesman, wrote in an email. Our ruling McAuliffe said the state has a fraud rate of 0.47 percent and that PolitiFact Virginia had verified that figure. A spokesman for the governor said McAuliffe made an innocent mistake in saying we found the statistic to be correct. In fact, we had never looked at the figure until now, and a number of experts told us that the governor erred in interpreting it as a fraud rate. The 0.47 is a computation of the percentage of Medicaid bills that were paid in 2012 for services that Virginians were ineligible to receive.

pomt-14976	From 2014 to 2015, Austin’s "murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/oct/16/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-says-austins-murder-rate-has-spiked-8/	Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly, suggesting domestic crime is rising thanks to "liberal compassion" shown to convicts by President Barack Obama and others, declared that murder rates in certain cities — including Austin— are surging. Bob Cole of Austin's KOKE FM radio brought his comments to our attention. O’Reilly said on the Oct. 7, 2015, episode of "The O’Reilly Factor": "The murder rate from 2014 to 15 is very instructive. "In Washington, D.C. it's up 46 percent. "In Milwaukee, up 68 percent. "In St. Louis, near Ferguson, up 51 percent. In Baltimore, up 54 percent. In Denver, up 75 percent." And, O’Reilly said, "in Austin, Texas, the murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent." "Those are facts," he added. "But President Obama and the left have not acknowledged them." Nevermind O'Reilly's dart at Obama. We at PolitiFact Texas were curious about his singling out the murder rate in our headquarters city. Has Austin’s murder rate surged 83 percent? Counting killings According to an online count of Austin homicides compiled by the Austin American-Statesman, based on deaths classified as murders by the Austin Police Department, 23 people have been killed in the city since the start of 2015, compared with 37 people in all of 2014. We asked O’Reilly how he reached his Austin conclusion. Fox pointed us to a City of Austin website presenting monthly crime reports from Art Acevedo, Austin’s police chief. O’Reilly relied on Acevedo’s August 2015 report stating 22 individuals had been murdered locally from January through August 2015, compared with 12 in the comparable stretch of 2014. That’s an 83 percent increase. But we realized that calculating these year-to-year percentage changes based on monthly reports can be misleading, given the small sample size. The day after O’Reilly spoke, the Austin Police Department posted the chief’s September 2015 report tallying 23 murders through that month of the year, up from 16 in the same part of 2014, or a 44 percent increase — roughly half the percentage relayed by O’Reilly. Notably, too, if O’Reilly had spoken out about Austin’s murder rate shortly after May 2015, he could have drawn on the chief’s reports to say it had ballooned 129 percent from the year before. Cherry picking? From the chief’s reports, we tried to get a fuller sense of changes by comparing full years of data. According to the chief’s December 2014 report, the 32 Austin murders that year exceeded the 25 murders in the city in 2013 by 28 percent. Annual APD crime reports by the department indicate there were 26 murders in the city in 2013; 33 in 2012; 27 in 2011; 38 in 2010; 22 in 2009; and 23 in 2008. We took a similar longer view of the latest count available to O’Reilly by comparing Austin murders reported by Austin’s chief for the 12 months from September 2014 through August 2015 (42) to murders reported by the chief for the previous comparable period (20), which indicated--gadzooks! -- a 100 percent-plus increase. A different longer view is possible via crime statistics collected and analyzed by the FBI, which also calculates murder rates. Austin’s estimated 2014 murder rate of 3.7 per 100,000 residents was up 22 percent from the 2013 rate of 3 murders per 100,000 residents, Austin police said in an April 2015 preliminary report based on how the FBI defines crimes. If Austin ends 2015 with 23 murders--the number reported by the chief through September 2015--the 2015 murder rate will be 2.5 murders per 100,000 residents, we estimate. Of course, that calculation unrealistically assumes Austin won’t have another murder before 2016. Still, Austin could end up with a lower murder rate in 2015 than 2014.. Austin Police Department, are local murders on a fast rise? We found another flaw with O'Reilly's methodology. Austin police Lt. Justin Newsom said caveats should be attached to the murder counts in the chief’s August 2015 report because it will be revised later. The 2014 tally has already been whittled down to remove deaths no longer classified as murders, and the 2015 count is almost certainly due to shrink. Newsom said the report’s count of 12 murders from January through August 2014 represents "real murders" and does not include killings not found to be murders by a grand jury or the district attorney. Conversely, Newsom said, the report’s count of 22 murders for the first eight months of 2015 folds in killings likely to be reclassified as homicides of a different variety, including, he said, six officer-involved shootings that could be deemed matters of self-defense or at the least not murders once finally reviewed by a grand jury and the district attorney. From the Statesman’s list of killings, we confirmed the six described police-involved shooting deaths, none of which had led to criminal charges at the time O’Reilly spoke. Generally, Newsom said by email, Austin homicide detectives have worked to resolve 18 murders that occurred in 2015 with all but two investigations culminating in suspects being identified, he said. If indeed 18 murders occurred from January 2015 through August 2015, that total would have been 50 percent greater than the murders tallied for the comparable part of 2014. Newsom sent us a chart showing the department’s count of murders each year from 2011 into 2015. On the chart, it looks as if there had been more murders in 2015 than through September in either of the previous two years yet fewer murders than during the comparable parts of 2011 or 2012. SOURCE: Austin Police Department, October 2015 (received by email from Lt. Justin Newsom, Homicide Division, APD, Oct. 9, 2015) Our ruling O’Reilly said that from 2014 to 2015, Austin’s "murder rate is up a whopping 83 percent." There’s an element of truth here; the Austin police chief’s August 2015 report had figures indicating an 83 percent uptick in murders through that month compared to the same chunk of 2014. But the year-to-year comparison places a raw count of violent deaths in 2015 against killings confirmed as murders for the same part of 2014--generating an incomplete incorrect percentage. In contrast, if O’Reilly had pulled back the camera, so to speak, he could have determined that Austin appears on pace to have a lower murder rate in 2015 than in 2014. We rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-05738	"[R]emember, the president proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/03/rick-santorum/santorum-attack-obama-mark/	If President Barack Obama has his way, it won’t pay for some to give anymore. Well, that’s the message Republican presidential contender Rick Santorum told an audience of about 3,000 people at a recent campaign stop in Georgia. Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, accused the president of attacking religious freedom in a political speech at the First Redeemer Church in Forsyth County. For the record, the church’s pastor has not endorsed a candidate in the race and said he’s invited every candidate, including Obama, to speak at his church. About 45 minutes into his remarks, Santorum made this statement: "Now we have an administration that’s trying to wipe the decks. Yes, remember, the president proposed eliminating charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers to cripple further these … churches and nonprofits." Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Jim Galloway reported the remarks in his Political Insider blog. PolitiFact Georgia wondered about this line about Obama’s proposal to eliminate charitable deductions for higher-income taxpayers. Obama has consistently proposed changes in charitable deductions that some religious organizations and nonprofit groups say would reduce giving by the rich. The White House counters that his ideas would result in "modest" changes, while others say the wealthy will still give. The president has proposed in his budget for fiscal year 2013 a reduction -- but not eliminating deductions for individuals making more than $200,000 a year or families reporting income greater than $250,000. The fiscal year will begins Oct. 1 and end Sept. 30, 2013. The proposal is similar to other plans Obama has put forward since taking office in 2009, experts on the matter told PolitiFact Georgia. The president has talked about reducing the deduction for the wealthiest income earners from 35 percent to 28 percent. None could recall an outright proposal to completely eliminate the deductions for higher-income Americans. "It’s limiting, not eliminating," Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said of the Obama plan. Nick Kasprak, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, said he was not aware of any effort by the Obama White House to eliminate charitable deductions for the highest income earners. He wondered whether Santorum was referring to the Pease Limitation, which reduces most itemized deductions by a complicated formula (we’re talking about the government here) that involves an individual’s adjusted gross income. But the Pease Limitation would not completely eliminate deductions for the wealthy. Williams suggested Santorum may have slipped up in this part of his speech to the Forsyth County audience. "It could be a loose statement," Williams said, being charitable. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan congressional committee, said in a report last year that charitable deductions cost the federal government $30 billion to $40 billion a year. PolitiFact Georgia filled out a form on Santorum’s campaign website with questions about this statement, but it didn’t get a reply. We also called the Santorum campaign, which cheerfully asked us to send an email to a campaign spokesman. We emailed the spokesman twice but didn’t get a reply. Santorum’s statement seems off base from anything we’ve seen or read. The Obama administration has talked repeatedly about reducing charitable deductions, not eliminating them. We rate Santorum’s claim as False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-03-03T06:00:00	2012-02-19	['None']
pomt-01508	Says Gwen Graham "was a Washington lobbyist."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/23/steve-southerland/steve-southerland-says-gwen-graham-was-washington-/	Republican congressman Steve Southerland is throwing attack after attack against his Democratic challenger, Gwen Graham, including the dreaded L-word: "lobbyist." In a Sept. 10, 2014, campaign commercial, Southerland, who represents a northern Florida district, accused the daughter of former Florida Gov. Bob Graham of a host of left-wing positions. "Graham was a Washington lobbyist and liberal political consultant who has taken thousands of dollars from Nancy Pelosi and her special interest allies," the commercial said. It also said she is "hiding the truth" that she supported the Affordable Care Act and was "handpicked" by Pelosi -- the House Democratic leader -- to run for the congressional seat. Politicians often turn to lobbying when their public careers have ended, but it’s less common for a lobbyist to run for office. Rep. David Jolly, who won a special election in March to succeed the late C.W. Bill Young in Pinellas County’s 13th District, spent years as a lobbyist, but he won despite attacks on his lobbying history by his Democratic opponent, former state CFO Alex Sink. Graham has been touting her resume as an attorney and employee of the Leon County School District. Did she once serve as a Washington lobbyist? Curriculum vitae In 1988, Graham graduated with a law degree from American University. She then worked with the firm Andrews & Kurth, a law firm that also did lobbying for some clients. One of those clients was the Secondary Lead Smelters Association. Southerland’s team pointed to lobbying disclosure records from 1989 and 1990 that list Gwendolyn G. Logan, Graham’s married name at the time. The lobbying paperwork says in part that the work was to "promote battery recycling legislation and other legislation affecting the secondary lead industry." In addition, Southerland points to an October 1990 handwritten staff note on the Lead Exposure Reduction Act from Bob Graham’s archive at the University of Florida. The note included the sentence from a staffer, "Put lead bill & materials in envelope to Becky for Gwen from BG," which Southerland’s camp considers proof of influence. Graham’s campaign quickly responded that her name being on disclosure forms was not proof of lobbying, because she did not participate in any such activity. It was her employer who listed her name on the forms. She even supplied a letter from her former Andrews & Kurth supervisor to prove it. The supervisor, Rob Steinwurtzel, wrote in a letter that the documents in question were not proof of Southerland’s claim. "We listed everybody in our group on the form, regardless whether they actually performed lobbying activities or not," Steinwurtzel told the Tampa Bay Times. "She came as a first-year associate and basically, first-year associates spend a lot of time in the library. She did not go to meetings with legislators or advocate on behalf of clients. I’m pretty certain about that." As for the handwritten note, the campaign said at the time the note was written, Graham was bed-ridden for a high-risk pregnancy. She gave birth to daughter Sarah three weeks later and soon left the firm. The staffer’s direction from her father could have referred to anything, the campaign said. Graham’s campaign had D.C. law firm Sandler Reiff explore the legality of Graham’s name being listed on the forms. The firm concluded that the filings in question fell under the purview of the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, which preceded the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act in effect today. Under the earlier rules, Graham would have had to have been in direct contact with members of Congress for herself or her clients, self-report her work, have done substantial work on the legislation in question, and register herself a lobbyist, although doing a certain amount of work for a client fell under the reporting threshold. She had done none of these things. It was also common practice for a firm to list all support staff, with no regard to what they had actually done for the client, Sandler Reiff’s Joshua Rosenstein concluded. Lobbying experts we spoke to agreed that rules were much different before the Lobbying Disclosure Act, and that undermines Southerland’s attack. "I think her firm is right by saying they were being overly compliant," said Lisa Gilbert, director of the Congress Watch Division for liberal consumer-advocacy group Public Citizen. "Under the definitions at the time she certainly did not perform lobbying activities. That said, to a layman, her support would seem like lobbying. You can’t tell from the documentation." Dan Auble, a lobbying researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics, said he wasn’t entirely familiar with requirements the earlier Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act, but the weakness of the paperwork is that you have to take Graham’s employer’s word for it. "If you take what the law firm is saying on its face, then she really didn’t," Auble said, although it’s possible the firm is stretching the truth. He said things have changed in Washington in the last 25 years -- and that’s something to keep in mind when considering Southerland’s claim. "People used to list names in the report because there was no stigma related to the word ‘lobbyist,' " he said. "Now no one wants to be called a lobbyist." Our ruling Southerland said Graham "was a Washington lobbyist." Even if it’s true that Graham lobbied, it would have been for a brief period a quarter-century ago. But it’s not at all clear that the charge is true. Southerland’s campaign based their attack on paperwork from the law firm Graham worked for after earning her law degree, listing her among the support staff. However, Graham provided a note from her supervisor saying that she was a researcher at the time and had not done actual lobbying work. She was listed because listing junior and support staff was a common practice at the time, according to a law firm retained by the Graham campaign. Experts we talked to agreed. At most, Graham’s inclusion on disclosure forms may have technically made her part of a lobbying effort, but there’s little evidence to suggest what, if anything, she did. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12594	"Police find 19 white female bodies in freezers with ‘Black Lives Matter’ carved into skin."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/06/blog-posting/story-19-white-women-killed-black-lives-matter-sup/	A racially charged fake news story about a black man killing white women and putting their corpses on ice has been spread around the Internet for the past year. It’s bogus. "Police find 19 white female bodies in freezers with ‘Black Lives Matter’ carved into skin," read the headline on a July 20, 2016, post on ViralDevil.com. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being false, as part of the social media website’s efforts to curtail fake news in users’ news feeds. The story said 39-year-old Rasheed Thompson was arrested in Chicago after neighbors reported suspicious activity. Police supposedly found the bodies while searching Thompson’s home. The post is made up, and it has changed a bit since first appearing early in 2016. The earliest version we found was posted on the fake news site Now8News.com, going back to at least Feb. 18, 2016. It was set in Los Angeles, and involved a man identified only as "Mathis," who hid 12 white women’s bodies in a freezer marked "Black Lives Matter." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That was followed up the same month by EmpireHerald.com, which wrote the version about Chicago’s Thompson killing 19 women. The original link is gone, but the Internet Archive Wayback Machine has a record of the story. EmpireHerald.com, a site filled with fake stories, carries no disclaimers about how its content is fabricated. It first started promoting the story the same day as the News8Now.com post. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com This version of the story ended up on several other websites throughout the year. None of the websites identified the story as fake. Some of the photographs often used to illustrate the story are of freezers really used to hide bodies, but aren’t of the fictional Thompson or his victims. One image showed a chest freezer used by a Japanese man who strangled his wife and hid the body for a decade. Another showed police removing a freezer in which a California man’s body had been hidden after he was killed. But this story and its details are fake. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-09824	"Every survey shows strong satisfaction with private coverage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/01/americas-health-insurance-plans/strong-satisfaction-health-insurance-coverage/	Opponents of President Barack Obama's health care reform plan say if ain't broke, don't fix it. They're referring to the current health care system in which most Americans get coverage from private insurers. They say most people are happy with private insurance and that it would be a mistake to mess with that. On CNN's Lou Dobbs Show on Aug. 27, 2009, Michael Tuffin, a spokesman for the insurance trade group America's Health Insurance Plans, cited public opinion in arguing that Congress should not approve a government-run insurance option. "What we need to do is to fix the insurance market so we get everybody covered," Tuffin said. "Make pre-existing conditions a thing of the past. Build on the system that works well for about 85 percent of Americans. Every survey shows strong satisfaction with private coverage. We need to build on that system rather than put it at risk with a government-run plan." We wondered if Tuffin was right that "every survey shows strong satisfaction." So we checked the poll results and called experts. We looked at a selection of recent polls in the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation's searchable database of health care survey data. At least two types of questions shed some light on Tuffin's assertion. The question that's most directly on point asks whether the respondent is satisfied with his or her current health plan. The exact wording varies from poll to poll and we'll leave out questions that ask broadly about health care (rather than health plans) because it includes many factors beyond just insurance. A second, related question asks people if they are satisfied with the cost of their health care. We'll start with some examples of the first question. A June 2009 poll by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 42 percent of respondents were "very satisfied" with their health plan and 39 percent were "somewhat satisfied." Just 11 percent were "somewhat dissatisfied" and 8 percent were "very dissatisfied." Meanwhile, a July 2009 poll by Abt SRBI for Time magazine found 53 percent very satisfied, 33 percent somewhat satisfied, 9 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 4 percent very dissatisfied. A Quinnipiac University poll found 49 percent very satisfied, 36 percent somewhat satisfied, 10 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 4 percent very dissatisfied. Even a survey by a Democratic polling firm — Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research for Democracy Corps — found the same general contours. In that June 2009 poll, 44 percent said they were very satisfied, 27 percent said they were somewhat satisfied, 11 percent said they were somewhat dissatisfied and 14 percent said they were very dissatisfied. Gallup asks the question somewhat differently in a survey conducted every November. Between 2001 and 2008, 20 to 28 percent of respondents rated their health care coverage "excellent" while between 39 and 51 percent rated their coverage "good." So, recent surveys generally indicate that Americans are satisfied with their current coverage, although it's not always the "strong satisfaction" that Tuffin claimed, especially in the Gallup data, in which "good" outpaces "excellent" by roughly 2-to-1. And the results for the other question undercut the notion of "strong satisfaction." When the June 2009 CBS- New York Times poll asked respondents what they felt about the cost of their premiums and the items not covered by their insurance, 23 percent said they were very satisfied, 27 percent said somewhat satisfied, 15 percent said not too satisfied and 33 percent — a plurality — said they were not at all satisfied. And when an ABC- Post poll from the same month asked the same question, the results were 23 percent very satisfied, 31 percent somewhat satisfied, 19 percent somewhat dissatisfied and 25 percent very dissatisfied. We asked three experts on health care polling — Robert Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health, Eric Nielsen, the senior director for media strategies at Gallup and Karlyn Bowman of the conservative American Enterprise Institue — for their view on the data. All agreed that people have consistently said they were satisfied with their health coverage. But Blendon and Nielsen emphasized that these polls have a major complicating factor. Pollsters almost always ask the questions to people who actually have insurance. That means the millions of Americans who are uninsured — and presumably aren't very happy — aren't included in the results. Another significant complication is that most polls do not differentiate between respondents who have private insurance and those who have Medicare, Medicaid or other government-run plans. (Nor, for that matter, do they differentiate between satisfaction levels for, say, HMOs and fee-for-service plans.) Gallup typically finds that between 26 and 33 percent of its respondents to the health care poll — not a trivial fraction — are covered through Medicare or Medicaid. For this reason, it's harder to say whether private insurance is more popular with consumers than government-run programs are. An AHIP spokesman told PolitiFact that the combination of "very" and "somewhat" satisfied — which together account for a big majority in every poll — justifies Tuffin's use of the phrase "strong satisfaction." But we think that to be "somewhat satisfied," as a big chunk of Americans are in every poll, falls short of "strong satisfaction." At the same time, many poll respondents expressed concerns about costs of the health care system. And since most independent polling data doesn't separate Americans' feelings about Medicare and Medicaid from private plans, it's an overreach to attribute Americans' warm feelings about their coverage simply to private insurance. On balance, then, we give Tuffin a Half True.	None	America's Health Insurance Plans	None	None	None	2009-09-01T18:26:54	2009-08-27	['None']
pomt-05349	On support for gay marriage.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/11/barack-obama/president-barack-obamas-shift-gay-marriage/	ABC broke into its daytime lineup May 9, 2012, to announce a historic shift: the president of the United States declaring his personal support for gay marriage. "I've been going through an evolution on this issue," President Barack Obama told ABC News. Indeed. While the president has consistently supported civil rights for gay couples — peppering his comments with specifics such as hospital visitation, transfer of property and Social Security benefits — his discussion of marriage has differed. He’s called same-sex marriage unstrategic, against his religious beliefs, and something that should be in the hands of churches rather than government. In 2008, he said: "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage." On Wednesday, by contrast, he said: "I’ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married." PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s just gauging whether they did. How does the president’s "evolution" on marriage rate? POLITICO and others have tracked Obama’s statements on same-sex marriage since 1996. Here’s our recap. Full circle Obama was in favor of same-sex marriage before he was against it — and before he was for it again. In 1996, as he ran for Illinois state Senate, Chicago’s Outlines gay newspaper asked candidates to fill out a questionnaire. Tracy Baim, the co-founder and publisher of Outlines, dug up a copy of the questionnaire in 2009, cataloging the president-elect’s shift. He had written on the 1996 questionnaire, "I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages." Just two years later, on another Outlines questionnaire, Obama wasn’t so sure. Did he favor legalizing same-sex marriage? "Undecided." Would he support a bill to repeal Illinois legislation prohibiting same-sex marriage? "Undecided." Would he co-sponsor it? "Undecided." Later years offered greater clarity — and a shift from 1996. Civil unions? Yes. Gay marriage? No. As Obama sought a U.S. Senate seat in 2004, he told the Windy City Times, "I am a fierce supporter of domestic-partnership and civil-union laws. I am not a supporter of gay marriage as it has been thrown about, primarily just as a strategic issue. I think that marriage, in the minds of a lot of voters, has a religious connotation. ..." He described his hesitation to endorse same-sex marriage as strategic and political. "What I'm saying is that strategically, I think we can get civil unions passed. … I think that to the extent that we can get the rights, I'm less concerned about the name. … Republicans are going to use a particular language that has all sorts of connotations in the broader culture as a wedge issue, to prevent us moving forward, in securing those rights, then I don't want to play their game." When he wrote his 2006 memoir, The Audacity of Hope, he offered a religious explanation for his definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. But he left the door open for yet another shift. "I believe that American society can choose to carve out a special place for the union of a man and a woman as the unit of child rearing most common to every culture. …" he said. "(But) it is my obligation not only as an elected official in a pluralistic society, but also as a Christian, to remain open to the possibility that my unwillingness to support gay marriage is misguided, just as I cannot claim infallibility in my support of abortion rights. I must admit that I may have been infected with society's prejudices and predilections and attributed them to God; that Jesus' call to love one another might demand a different conclusion; and that in years hence I may be seen as someone who was on the wrong side of history." He said his doubts didn't make him a bad Christian — but human, limited in his understanding of God’s purpose and therefore "prone to sin." "When I read the Bible, I do so with the belief that it is not a static text but the Living Word and that I must continually be open to new revelations — whether they come from a lesbian friend or a doctor opposed to abortion." Still, in a 2007 Democratic primary debate sponsored by a gay rights group and a gay-oriented cable TV channel, he spoke instead about his support for civil unions with "all the benefits that are available for a legally sanctioned marriage" — but not for legal recognition of "marriage" between same-sex couples. It should be up to religious denominations to determine whether they wanted to recognize that as marriage or not, he said. In August 2008, he told Southern California megachurch Pastor Rick Warren his definition of marriage: "I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union. God's in the mix." He later added: "I am not somebody who promotes same-sex marriage, but I do believe in civil unions." In November 2008, he said much the same thing to a rather different audience: MTV. "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage." By October 2010, almost two years into his presidency, he acknowledged his views were evolving. But he wasn’t prepared to reverse himself, he said. He told a group of liberal bloggers, "I have been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily because of my understandings of the traditional definitions of marriage. But I also think you’re right that attitudes evolve, including mine." He offered an explanation that would presage his 2012 shift: "I think that it is an issue that I wrestle with and think about because I have a whole host of friends who are in gay partnerships. I have staff members who are in committed, monogamous relationships, who are raising children, who are wonderful parents. And I care about them deeply. And so while I’m not prepared to reverse myself here, sitting in the Roosevelt Room at 3:30 in the afternoon, I think it’s fair to say that it’s something that I think a lot about. That’s probably the best you’ll do out of me today." A year and a half later, he announced the result of that wrestling and thinking. Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts asked him on Wednesday, "Mr. President, are you still opposed to same-sex marriage?" He answered: Well, you know, I have to tell you, as I've said, I've been going through an evolution on this issue. I've always been adamant that — gay and lesbian — Americans should be treated fairly and equally. And that's why in addition to everything we've done in this administration, rolling back Don't Ask, Don't Tell — so that, you know, outstanding Americans can serve our country. Whether it's no longer defending the Defense Against Marriage Act, which tried to federalize what has historically been state law. I've stood on the side of broader equality for the LGBT community. And I had hesitated on gay marriage — in part, because I thought civil unions would be sufficient. That that was something that would give people hospital visitation rights and other elements that we take for granted. And I was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people, you know, the word marriage was something that evokes very powerful traditions, religious beliefs, and so forth. But I have to tell you that over the course of several years, as I talk to friends and family and neighbors. When I think about members of my own staff who are incredibly committed, in monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together. When I think about those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet, feel constrained, even now that Don't Ask, Don't Tell is gone, because they're not able to commit themselves in a marriage. At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married. Our ruling Obama, a consistent supporter of civil rights for gay couples, nevertheless said as early as 2004 and through 2008 that he didn’t support same-sex marriage. He had written that he believed "that American society can choose to carve out a special place for the union of a man and a woman." In 2010, he said he wasn’t prepared to reverse himself. This week, the president said he thinks same-sex couples should be able to get married. On the Flip-O-Meter, he earns a Full Flop.

pomt-09345	"The most private question on this year’s form asks for an individual’s race, and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census conducted under then-President George Washington."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/07/patrick-mchenry/rep-patrick-mchenry-claims-every-census-history-ha/	In an op-ed piece for the conservative website Red State on April 1, 2010, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the ranking Republican on the Information Policy, Census and National Archives Subcommittee, sought to tamp down some of the misinformation being spread about the census by "otherwise well-meaning conservatives" and warned that failing to fully participate in the census could create a competitive advantage for Democrats. Specifically, McHenry attempted to allay the fear among some Republicans who distrust the government and view the census as overly prying. By law, the U.S. Census Bureau cannot share a person's personal information with anyone, including other federal agencies and law enforcement entities. All Census Bureau employees take an oath of nondisclosure and are sworn for life to protect the confidentiality of the data. The penalty for unlawful disclosure is a fine of up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment of up to five years. Nonetheless, a Pew Research Center survey in mid-March found nearly one in three Republicans did not think the Census Bureau would keep personal information confidential (slightly higher than the mistrust among Democrats); and when asked if the census asks for more information than the government really needs, 61 percent of Republicans either responded "yes" or "don't know," as opposed 47 percent of Democrats. In his posting on Red State, McHenry said "the most private question on this year’s form asks for an individual’s race and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census conducted under then-President George Washington." We decided to check that claim out, which was similar to one from Census Bureau director Robert M. Groves in a March 15, 2010, press release: "It's one of the shortest forms in our lifetime with just 10 questions very much like the questions James Madison and Thomas Jefferson helped craft on the very first Census." Conveniently, the U.S. Census Bureau keeps historical records online of all the questions asked in every census going back to the first one in 1790. If you follow the census questions asked through U.S. history, you can see how they reflect changing attitudes and understandings about race. Yes, the 1790 census and others in the early years of the survey addressed race, but it was hardly a matter of checking a box. Rather, the census asked about the number of free white males and females; the number of "all other free persons" and the number of slaves. By 1850, the Census asked about people's "color." According to the Census archives, this column was to be left blank if a person was white, marked "B" if a person was black, and marked "M" if a person was mulatto. A separate form listed slave inhabitants, the last census to do so. By 1870, the "color" options included "W" for white, "B" for black, "M" for mulatto, "C" for Chinese (a category which included all Asians), or "I" for American Indian. The question morphed into "color or race" in the mid-1900s, and then, finally to just "race" in 1970. In 1980, in addition to race, the Census began asking if a person was of Spanish or Hispanic origin or descent. It's fair to say that every census has addressed the issue of race in some fashion. But we think it's a bit of a stretch when McHenry says "this year's asks for an individual’s race and that question has been asked by every census since the 1790 census." In the 1790 Census (and several after it), a respondent was not simply asked their race. Rather, they were asked to list the number of white people, the number of "other free persons" and the number of slaves. In other words, it didn't ask for the race of non-whites. One could argue this reflects the common attitude about race at the time. But that's hardly the same as the 2010 version that simply asks a person's race. Prior to the Civil War the census was more concerned with whether someone was enslaved or not, and establishing whether someone was white. This is a very different conception from our modern idea of race. Post Civil War, the terminology changed (from "color" to "race," for example) and the categories expanded over time. Certainly these are different standards when compared to today's measures. But again, one could argue that the questions comported with attitudes about race at those times, and the census has always asked descriptive questions that corrolate to race. So we rule McHenry's claim Mostly True.	None	Patrick McHenry	None	None	None	2010-04-07T17:50:58	2010-04-01	['None']
pomt-10159	"Obama, Biden and their liberal allies oppose clean coal."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/01/john-mccain/a-clean-hit-not-quite/	"Clean coal," the promising yet distant ideal of burning coal for electricity without releasing harmful pollution, appeals to just about everybody. Yet a new radio advertisement by Sen. John McCain's campaign, targeted to the coal-rich states of Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, alleges that Sen. Barack Obama opposes it. "Clean coal is important to America. And to Colorado/Ohio/Pennsylvania/Virginia," the ad says, tailoring the narration to the state. "For [residents of that state], coal means thousands of jobs. Economic growth. More affordable electricity. For America, coal means energy independence. And clean coal means cleaner air. But Obama-Biden and their liberal allies oppose clean coal. Listen to Joe Biden." The ad then replays part of an exchange between Biden and a voter on a rope line in Maumee, Ohio, in on Sept. 17, 2008: "Senator, wind and solar are flourishing here in Ohio, so why are you supporting clean coal?" the voter asked. "We're not supporting clean coal," Biden replied. "Guess what, China is building two every week, two dirty coal plants, and it's polluting the United States, it's causing people to die." He touted his record on supporting solar energy and fighting global warming, then continued: "But guess what, China's going to burn 300 years of bad coal unless we figure out how to clean their coal up, because it's going to ruin your lungs, and there's nothing we can do about it. No coal plants here in America. Build them if they're going to build them over there. Make them clean, because they're killing you." The phrase "clean coal" refers to a number of technologies, some in use and others early in the development stage, which would allow the burning of coal for energy without the harmful pollution that coal-fired power plants currently emit. Chief among them is "carbon sequestration," a process by which the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide would be captured and injected underground or into the ocean, where it would not contribute to global warming. That is at least a decade or two away. Strictly speaking, Biden's comments in Maumee were not evidence that he "oppose[s] clean coal," as the ad claims – rather they suggest he opposes clean coal plants in the United States, but supports the idea of developing the technology here and providing it to China. In fact, Biden himself has voiced support for clean coal, calling for "carbon capture and sequestration technologies that will allow us to use coal cleanly" in the energy plan he released during his presidential campaign in the autumn of 2007. In a statement , Obama campaign spokesman David Wade explained Biden's comments this way: "Senator Biden's point is that China is building coal plants with outdated technology every day, and the United States needs to lead by developing clean coal technologies." Moreover, Biden's remarks are far outweighed by the many instances in which Obama has spoken out in favor of clean coal, as our fellow fact-checkers at FactCheck.org pointed out recently . Here's Obama in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 28, 2008: "As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power." Here he is in Detroit, Mich., on May 7, 2007: "We'll also need to find a way to use coal – America's most abundant fossil fuel – without adding harmful greenhouse gases to the environment." If there were any doubt that Obama supports the development of clean-coal plants in the United States specifically, the energy plan on his Web site makes that explicit: "Barack Obama and Joe Biden will...develop and deploy clean coal technology. Carbon capture and storage technologies hold enormous potential to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as we power our economy with domestically produced and secure energy...Barack Obama and Joe Biden will instruct DOE (the Department of Energy) to enter into public private partnerships to develop “first-of-a-kind” commercial scale coal-fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration." So no, Obama and his "liberal allies" do not oppose clean coal. Nor does Biden, unless you interpret comments he made off the cuff on a rope line overly broadly, and give them more credence than the energy plan he developed during his presidential campaign. We find McCain's claim to be False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-01T00:00:00	2008-10-01	['Joe_Biden', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-07809	Under changes being debated, state employees in Wisconsin "who earn $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/17/ed-schultz/talk-show-host-ed-schultz-says-wisconsin-state-emp/	When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed making state employees pay more for health and pension benefits, one of his aides said the changes would cost the average worker roughly 8 percent of his or her salary. Walker’s move so angered MSNBC-TV talk show host Ed Schultz that he came to Madison on Feb. 17, 2011 -- the day the Legislature was scheduled to vote on the proposals -- to air his show. Two days earlier, Schultz claimed on "The Ed Show" the impact on state workers would be much greater than 8 percent. He said: "People who earn $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight." Schultz hedged a bit by saying might. But the implication was the effect of Walker’s proposals would be to cut the income of large numbers of state workers by 20 percent. Let’s see if he’s right. Schultz said in the broadcast that he had been given figures that show a 20 percent impact. We asked his staff for that information and they said they would attempt to provide it. But as of publication, we have not heard from them. Under the Republican governor’s plan, state employees would contribute 5.8 percent of their pay toward pensions and pay at least 12 percent of their health insurance premiums. Meanwhile, we consulted other sources on how much more state workers would pay if the budget repair bill is adopted. It’s a political debate, but this is largely a mathematical question. Here’s what our sources said: Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the state Department of Administration: The higher contributions would amount to, on average, a 9.4 percent cut in take-home pay. Joe Wineke, former administrator of the state Division of Compensation and Labor Relations and former chairman of the state Democratic Party: The impact on most workers would be 6.8 percent to 11 percent of their salary. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie: Detailed estimates are being prepared, but the cost to the average worker would be about 8 percent of their wages. University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Chancellor Brian Levin-Stankevich: In a memo, he said a UW-Eau Claire employee who earns $40,000 per year would pay an annual pension contribution of $2,320, up from $80; and an annual health insurance premium for family coverage of $2,820, up from $1,068. That’s a total of $3,992 per year, or 12.9 percent of that employee’s salary. Under the plan, all employees would pay the same percentage of their income toward pensions. But the larger health insurance payments would eat up a higher percentage of the income of low-income employees than of high-income employees. So the total impact would vary on a percentage basis. That said, the total impact, in terms of a percentage of income, would not vary widely, according to Wineke. The vast majority of state employees take the same so-called Tier 1 health coverage, he said. Let’s return to the statement: Schultz said Wisconsin state employees earning $30,000 to $50,000 per year "might have 20 percent of their income just disappear overnight" as a result of Walker’s proposals to boost state employee payments for health and pension benefits. It was a broad statement about the impact of the measures. The sources we consulted indicate the range is 6.8 percent to 11 percent. Even if the higher payments comprise 20 percent of the income of some employees, there’s no indication it will be that high on a wide scale, particularly for state workers earning as much as $50,000 per year. If Schultz can provide evidence of a large-scale 20 percent impact, we’ll review this item. But this is our rating: False. (Editor’s note: On March 4, 2011, this item was changed to fix an error in the percentage of employee salary that goes toward paying for pensions and health insurance for a hypothetical employee at UW-Eau Claire.)

pomt-08934	Georgia is "the Saudi Arabia of pine trees."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/25/georgia-politicians/politicans-claim-georgia-pine-trees-what-saudi-ara/	Some phrases just seem to take on a life of their own in Georgia politics. Take a catchphrase of the just-ended primary election cycle. Republicans tossed it about. Democrats dished it out. It was used by failed GOP gubernatorial hopeful Eric Johnson. And Roy Barnes used it in a campaign video in his successful bid for the Democratic Party’s nomination for governor. And don't be surprised if you hear it again as the election cycle moves forward. Georgia, politicians have proclaimed, "is the Saudi Arabia of pine trees." The implication is that Georgia's pines could have a major impact on our nation's fuel needs, perhaps substantially reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Georgia has been called many things through the years -- Empire State of the South, the Peach State and the Goober State (this one owing to its prowess growing peanuts, not producing politicians). But the Saudi Arabia of Pine Trees? And where did that new moniker-in-the-making originate? Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest producer and exporter of petroleum liquids. It is the world’s second largest crude oil producer behind Russia. It has one-fifth of the world’s proven petroleum reserves. Georgia, meanwhile, certainly has a lot of pine trees. And pines are one of the things being looked at by the fledgling ethanol industry, which hopes to produce fuel from a variety of sustainable crops. There have also been proposals to use pine pellets to produce electricity. A massive 2007 study by the U.S. Forest Service found Georgia had about 16 billion cubic feet of pines growing within its borders. That included longleaf and slash pines, loblolly and short-leaf pines, "other" yellow pines and even a few white and red pines. The 350-page report showed Georgia comes in ahead of other Southern states in pine production. And those Southern states top other states in pine production. Nathan McClure, director of forest energy for the Georgia Forestry Commission, said the state has about 24.4 million acres of "commercial timberland." He estimated that about half that is planted in pines. The state’s forest industry is huge, producing a direct economic impact of about $18 billion in 2008, McClure said. The indirect impact pushes that figure to about $28 billion, he estimated. McClure, however, said his agency has tried to steer clear of the Saudi Arabia comparison that is getting bandied about by politicians. "We don’t like that statement because of the inference about the Mideast at the same time we are in the middle of a war in the Mideast," McClure said. In November 2008, Range Fuels broke ground for the nation’s first cellulosic ethanol plant at a site in rural Treutlen County, just outside Soperton. That facility will use pine trees to produce ethanol. Jill Stuckey, who directs the alternative fuels program for the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, said the state is second only to Oregon when it comes to trees. "And Oregon’s forests are old-growth and slow-growing compared to Georgia’s," Stuckey said. "We grow trees like Iowa grows corn." But like Saudi Arabia produces oil? We had to drill a little deeper for that connection, all the way back to April 2008 and an article in Georgia Trend magazine. In that issue, Susan Varlamoff, director of the Office of Environmental Sciences at the University of Georgia, talked about Georgia’s potential to produce fuel from various agricultural products, items referred to by scientists as "biomass." The article noted that Varlamoff "has coined a now well-worn phrase, calling Georgia 'the Saudi Arabia of biomass.' " Varlamoff, as it turns out, was very careful to use the term "biomass" and not pine trees. And there’s a good reason. She was talking about a variety of items that could be used to produce alternative fuels. Pine trees are certainly included in that equation, she told PolitiFact Georgia. But so are paper pulp, peanut shells, pecan shells and about a billion pounds of chicken fat and grease from the poultry processing industry. "We are the Saudi Arabia of biomass," Varlamoff reiterated to PolitiFact Georgia. Varlamoff, however, said she never limited her statement to pine trees. The politicians and their handlers took care of that rhetorical flourish. "Honestly, somebody just decided to make that change," she said. Georgia does have a lot of pine trees. And they could play a vital role in the development of any alternative fuel industry in the state. But so will a lot of other agricultural products. And there are still many questions about the viability of the alternative fuels industry. The Saudi Arabia of pine trees? Well, Georgia is at least the Kuwait of conifers. We give this one a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05683	There are "850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/14/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-touts-850000-buckeye-state-j/	How do you know if a Democratic candidate is talking about the auto industry bailout in Ohio? His lips are moving. But, seriously, few issues excite party operatives more these days than the resurgence of Chrysler and General Motors, both rescued by the federal government. Democrats see it as a huge positive for President Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who just so happen to be up for re-election this year, and a huge negative for their Republican challengers. And while this might make for smart politics, particularly in states such as Michigan and Ohio, sometimes the crisp talking points come at the expense of facts. With this in mind, PolitiFact Ohio chose to look at a number that the Ohio Democratic Party has seized on with gusto. The party trotted the number out in a March 13, 2012, news release targeting Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, Brown’s Republican opponent in the Senate contest. The news release trumpeted criticism from Toledo-area auto workers toward Mandel, saying he would have opposed auto industry bailouts. There are "850,000 Ohio jobs tied to the auto industry," the release said. That number has become key to ODP’s core argument. The party used it in two other recent releases. One on March 6, the day of the Super Tuesday primary, took aim at front-running Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, an outspoken opponent of bailouts. The other on March 12 targeted Mandel. We’re not addressing Mandel’s position on the auto bailouts or how Romney’s anti-bailout view will serve him if he faces off against Obama in November. That’s a political calculation for another forum. ODP Chairman Chris Redfern and others have repeatedly claimed that the industry would have died had Romney and Mandel been calling the shots on the bailouts. That, too, is a hypothetical pretty much impossible to prove one way or the other. But what about the number? We asked Andrew Zucker, the ODP’s press secretary, for the source, and he pointed us to the Center for Automotive Research, or CAR. In 2010, the independent group from Ann Arbor, Mich., published a 55-page report examining the U.S. auto industry’s economic worth nationwide. Side note: We started looking into the number’s accuracy after it was used in those two previous releases. By the time we had downloaded the report, Zucker had fired off the latest ODP missive, using the same statistic -- but this time with a full citation. We’re using that statement for this item. An appendix on page 48 of the report provides a state by state breakdown that attributes 848,304 Ohio jobs to the U.S. auto industry. That’s roughly 12 percent of the state’s workforce, according to CAR. PolitiFact Ohio then took a closer look at how CAR arrived at its figures. For starters, it is important to understand what types of jobs factor into the group’s analysis. CAR looks at three levels of employment: direct, intermediate and a category they call spin-off. Direct employees include those who work for automakers, parts manufacturers or car dealers. Intermediate employees work for companies that sell goods or services used by the direct employers. And spin-off jobs are the jobs created by the spending activity of employees in the direct and intermediate categories. Such employees could be a cashier at the supermarket or mall, a waiter or a bartender. In Ohio, about 149,000 jobs are attributed to direct employment, 285,000 to intermediate and 415,000 to spin-off. Half of the jobs are tied to automakers rather than suppliers or dealers. It is clear, though, that intermediate and spin-off jobs account for a majority of the estimated jobs. Those numbers, according to CAR’s report, come from a "dynamic, inter-industry model" -- in other words, a simulation that includes multipliers. The methodology is not uncommon. We touched base with Kim Hill, one of the report’s authors, who confirmed what PolitiFact Ohio suspected. These estimates include not only U.S. automakers with Ohio operations, but also foreign automakers such as Honda, which has an Ohio presence. That is a key point because the ODP has typically used the 850,000 number in a context that suggests that’s how many jobs were at stake in the bailout. ODP, in the March 12 news release that also targeted Mandel, went as far as saying "850,000 Ohio jobs … would have been in jeopardy" had a hypothetical Sen. Mandel and his colleagues voted against the bailout. This would be more accurate if those 850,000 jobs were tied solely to Chrysler and GM, the beneficiaries of the bailout. But had these two companies failed, Ohio still would have Honda, as well as suppliers and dealers that also do business with other foreign companies and Ford. Honda employs more than 13,500 Ohioans, according to recent media statements. The company has announced more than $500 million in Ohio investment since late 2010. Hill gave the ODP a pass here and noted that industrywide fallout from the collapse of two giants would have been significant for suppliers and other service providers and thus would have impacted spin-off employment, as well. Hill also noted that those jobs are supported by the auto industry not just in Ohio but in other states, too. A generic example would be a Cleveland metals manufacturer or another Ohio company that provides some professional service (an intermediate employer) to a Detroit automaker (a direct employer). In this case, it is auto industry in Michigan that is supporting the jobs in Ohio. The ODP’s claim was that "850,000 Ohio jobs (are) tied to the auto industry." That is an accurate statement. While the jobs figure includes intermediate and spinoff jobs, as well as direct employment, that manner of counting is not uncommon for evaluating employment impact. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the statement True.	None	Ohio Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-03-14T06:00:00	2012-03-13	['Ohio']
pomt-11616	"California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote – Automatically."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2018/jan/24/worldnetdaily/no-california-didnt-pass-law-allowing-undocumented/	In April 2018, a new law will allow Californians to automatically register to vote when they renew their driver’s license. It’s intended to bolster registration in a state where voter turnout has lagged. A slew of conservative websites, however, have seized on the law, dubbed the California New Motor Voter Program, to make the claim this week that it will register undocumented immigrants to vote. They cite a separate law, AB 60, that allows undocumented Californians to apply for and obtain a state driver’s license, as alleged proof. This World Net Daily headline on Jan. 21, 2018 sparked the recent claims: "California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote – Automatically." Shortly after it was published, similar allegations were made by The New American, FoxNews.com and conservative commentators Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. This isn’t the first wave of commentary on the topic. Similar statements were made when California passed the Motor Voter program in 2015. But because the claims popped up again this week, it’s time to take another look at the California laws in question and the safeguards state officials say are in place. We’ll also place a rating on the claim by World Net Daily. Background on the laws Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 60 in 2013, making California the 10th state to allow driver licenses for people in the country illegally. The goal was to increase public safety and reduce penalties for undocumented immigrants who drive. As of June 2017, the state Department of Motor Vehicles had issued more than 900,000 of the licenses. In 2015, Brown signed the New Motor Voter law. By April, it will automatically register DMV customers to vote when they renew or obtain a driver’s license or fill out change of address forms, unless the customer opts-out. Under the law, the DMV would electronically send information for those eligible to register to vote -- which does not include undocumented residents -- to the California Secretary of State’s Office. That office would, in turn, verify name and citizenship information. A spokesman for that office did not respond to requests for comment this week. In the past, however, Secretary of State Alex Padilla has pledged the new system will be an improvement over the existing one. "Automated voter registration is actually a more secure way of doing things," Padilla told the Huffington Post in 2015. Potential voters "have to demonstrate proof of age, the vast majority of time people are showing a birth certificate or a passport, which also reflects citizenship. That’s arguably more secure than someone checking a box under penalty of perjury." "Completely inaccurate" claims Jessica Gonzalez, spokeswoman with the California DMV, said she’s contacted several of the websites making what she called "completely inaccurate" claims and asked for corrections. One, the Daily Mail, had pulled down its story, another updated its article, while she said Fox News did not immediately correct its article. "Undocumented Californians are not eligible to register to vote at the DMV," Gonzalez told PolitiFact California. "And we have programming measures in place to prevent that from occurring." At DMV field offices, Gonzalez said, technicians will not be able to key in any voting information for undocumented customers seeking AB 60 license renewals. As soon as a technician types in AB 60, the voter information section automatically gets "greyed out" and can’t be typed into and can’t be bypassed, the spokeswoman said. She added that the same safeguards are in place for online and mail renewals. "The (mail) form won’t even have the voter information questions on it, so they won’t be able to register to vote," Gonzalez said. "It’s really interesting how quickly false information spreads," she continued, "and how difficult it is to get the correct information out there to Californians that really need to know this information." A representative for World Net Daily could not be reached for comment. Several fact-checking websites, from Snopes.com to The Weekly Standard, a conservative publication, examined the topic this week. The Weekly Standard concluded "there is zero evidence to support that ludicrous claim." Our ruling Conservative news websites and commentators claimed California plans to register undocumented immigrants to vote. This isn’t the first time such unsubstantiated claims have been made. But the recent spat was sparked by the World Net Daily headline: "California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote – Automatically." In reality, the California law that goes into effect in April 2018 will automatically register only those eligible to vote when they renew or obtain a driver’s license. Undocumented immigrants are excluded. The law does nothing to change the federal requirement that one must be a U.S. citizen to register to vote. State officials said safeguards are already in place to prevent state DMV workers from typing in any voter information for AB 60 license holders. The state allows unauthorized immigrants to obtain a driver’s license, but explicitly excludes that group from the automatic voter registration. The allegations on this topic are recycled. And they’re still blatantly untrue. We rate World Net Daily’s claim Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. UPDATE: After we published our fact check, World Net Daily published a separate article saying a spokeswoman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles "cleared up an inaccuracy in WND’s initial report." It said the spokeswoman explained that California’s licenses for undocumented immigrants "are not eligible for the new voter registration system." As of Jan. 29, 2018, World Net Daily had not updated its original report with this information.

pomt-00372	Says at his confirmation hearing Brett Kavanaugh said birth control methods could be considered "abortion-inducing drugs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/10/kamala-harris/brett-kavanaugh-birth-control-abortion-inducing/	Democrats rallied around Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s reference to popular contraceptive methods as "abortion-inducing" during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., tweeted an 11-second clip in which Kavanaugh said, "Filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objected to." "Kavanaugh chooses his words very carefully, and this is a dog whistle for going after birth control," Harris tweeted. "He was nominated for the purpose of taking away a woman’s constitutionally protected right to make her own health care decisions. Make no mistake — this is about punishing women." Several other Democrats tweeted similar statements. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In Harris’ tweet, Kavanaugh appears to believe birth control is an abortion-inducing drug. Does he? We’re not sure what he believes. He hasn't said so in the confirmation hearings. Harris’ tweet takes Kavanaugh’s statement out of context. Harris cut an important second out of the clip — the attribution. Kavanaugh said, "They said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were, as a religious matter, objecting to." "They" refers to a Catholic nonprofit group, Priests for Life. Kavanaugh was answering a question from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about a case in which he argued Priests for Life shouldn’t have to provide women with the contraceptive coverage mandated by the Affordable Care Act for religious reasons. A later reply to that tweet included a two-minute clip with the full question and answer. Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said Kavanaugh was using the limited time available to summarize the arguments made by the plaintiff. "It’s very clear he’s characterizing their position, which was held by all the Catholic organizations within that set of cases," Kupec said. "But even within characterizing their position, if you look at the dissent, it’s still not a blanket description of birth control." In the dissent, Kavanaugh writes, "They complain that submitting the required form contravenes their religious beliefs because doing so, in their view, makes them complicit in providing coverage for contraceptives, including some that they believe operate as abortifacients." The question is significant to abortion rights activists because most common types of contraception don’t prevent implantation but fertilization. According to the medical community, pregnancy begins after a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus. If a Supreme Court justice believes pregnancy begins at fertilization it could jeopardize the legality of birth control methods for women. Harris’ office pointed out that at no point in his answer did Kavanaugh disagree with this definition of contraception, note it was medically inaccurate, or acknowledge it was politically charged. "In his full answer, he uses the term uncritically," said Lily Adams, communications director for Harris. "He doesn’t say ‘so-called,’ ‘I don’t agree with it,’ there’s no caveat that he gives that he does not agree with the term." Adams added that Kavanaugh was not exactly quoting the dissent, as the phrase used in the case was abortion-inducing products, not drugs. Kavanaugh has not defined what he believes constitutes "abortion-inducing drugs." But the White House insisted that in that statement, "He did not express a personal view." White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said it was not the judge’s job to be critical of the term, quoting another segment of the dissent. "The Supreme Court has emphasized that judges in Religious Freedom Restoration Act cases may question only the sincerity of a plaintiff’s religious belief, not the correctness or reasonableness of that religious belief," Kavanaugh wrote, citing Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby and Thomas vs. Review Board. In the follow-up to his answer, Kavanaugh says the government did, in fact, have a compelling reason to ensure birth control access to the employees. But he determined the government could provide it without doing so on the backs of the religious objector. Our ruling Harris tweeted a clip in which Kavanaugh said, "Filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were -- as a religious matter, objected to." In Harris’ tweet, Kavanaugh appears to define contraception as abortion-inducing. But the video failed to include a crucial qualifier: "They said." In fact, he was citing the definition of the religious group Priests for Life. He has not expressed his personal view. We rate this statement False.

pomt-02209	"Social science is irrefutable" that children are better off being raised by a mom and a dad.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/22/ralph-reed/ralph-reed-says-irrefutable-social-science-shows-k/	On ABC’s Easter Sunday edition of This Week, host Martha Raddatz discussed the intersection of religion and politics with her guests. "Just a few months after taking office, Pope Francis spoke out on the issue of homosexuality, saying, ‘If they accept the Lord and have goodwill, who am I to judge them?’ " she said. " ‘They shouldn't be marginalized, the tendency to homosexuality is not the problem. They're our brothers.’ " Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed told Raddatz he doesn’t support gay couples raising adopted children. "This is about what's best for children here in the United States. And the social science is irrefutable," Reed said. "And it is that a child who grows up in a home without the mother and father present and they both play very unique procreative, nurturing and socializing role, they're nine times more likely to end up dropping out of high school. They're five times more likely to end up in poverty. And they're three times more likely to end up addicted to drugs and alcohol." PunditFact wanted to know what social science has to say about the effects gay parents have on children compared to straight parents. The social science statistics Reed called "irrefutable" actually have nothing to do with gay couples raising kids. Instead, they’re focused on the effects of children who grow up without a father in a one-parent household. Put another way, the studies focus on the quantity of parents and not their gender. Reed’s office pointed us to his book, as well as a Brookings Institution report that says parents who graduate from high school and bear children within marriage have a 2 percent chance of living in poverty. But neither the study nor his book draws any comparison between gay and straight marriages. In fact, it makes no mention of gay marriages. Other research often cited by gay parenting critics, like Sara McLanahan’s Growing Up With a Single Parent, similarly doesn’t include any information on gay parenting, specifically. Again, the critique is focused on having one parent present versus two. We decided not to investigate further the specific stats Reed cited once we realized they weren’t measuring what he said they were. Comparisons like Reed’s are "a complete misuse of the research," said Judith Stacey, a New York University sociologist. We did find one study funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it’s been denounced by the American Sociological Association, the researcher’s own university and many reputable sociologists. In conducting the study, Mark Regnerus loosely defined same-sex couples and, in doing so, only spoke with two children who were actually raised by gay parents. Research is still limited, but many reputable studies so far have concluded that children of gay parents, generally speaking, are just as well off as children of straight parents. What’s more important is the number of parents a child has, experts told us. "Kids are better off with two parents," said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. "But we don't have much evidence that those parents must be of the opposite gender." Our ruling Reed said there’s "irrefutable" social science to show that children are better off being parented by a mother and father. That’s not right. What studies really show is that children are better off with two parents. Those studies do not focus on gender. All reputable research so far indicates that children brought up by gay parents are just well off as those brought up by straight parents. We rate Reed’s statement False.

pomt-11047	"A Trump fan was just charged with trying to murder Maxine Waters on same day Trump threatened her."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/28/blog-posting/no-trump-supporter-did-not-try-murder-rep-maxine-w/	A headline buzzing on social media falsely said one of President Donald Trump’s supporters was charged with attempting to murder U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., the same day Trump targeted her on Twitter. "A Trump fan was just charged with trying to murder Maxine Waters on same day Trump threatened her," said a June 26, 2018, headline from The Washington Press, an online news website. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This story is false. According to the inaccurate report, Trump’s attack on Waters was a "barely veiled threat" based on a misunderstanding of Waters’ comments about the public’s treatment of officials in the Trump administration. The tweet came in response to video footage that showed Waters, at a rally outside a federal office building in Los Angeles, encouraging Trump opponents to boo or harass Trump administrators in public spaces. "Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!," Trump wrote. The false story said Trump’s tweet coincided with a California man’s guilty plea in relation to a murder threat delivered to Waters. The plea — entered by Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, of San Pedro, California — proved that "the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences," the story said. The story erred in getting details and timing of real incidents wrong. A man by the name of Anthony Scott Lloyd did, in fact, plead guilty to threatening a United States official. Lloyd phoned Waters’ office on Oct. 22, 2017, and left a voicemail riddled with derogatory language, including racial epithets and expletives. The message used the words "dead" and "kill" a total of four times, according to a press release from the Department of Justice. "If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you," Lloyd said, according to court documents. "If you do it again, you’re dead." (We obtained a digital copy of the plea agreement, which included a full transcript of the voicemail, from Thom Mrozek, spokesperson for the United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California.) But Lloyd plead guilty on April 16, 2018, and Trump tweeted at Waters more than two months later on June 25, 2018. So it is not true that the two events occurred on the same day, as the false headline suggested. The headline is likely not the result of confusion, either, because no reports related to Lloyd’s case were released on the day of Trump’s tweet. Lloyd’s sentencing date is set for July 16, 2018, and Mrozek said there have not been any new developments in the case since the guilty plea. Plus, Lloyd only plead guilty to threatening Waters. He was not charged with "trying to murder" the congresswoman. Mrozek said prosecutors have not made any allegations related to an actual attempt at murder. The Washington Press did not respond to a request for comment. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12779	Says Sen. John McCain was "caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/21/blog-posting/did-john-mccain-violate-logan-act-call-australian-/	U.S. Sen. John McCain’s attempt to smooth over a contentious phone call between President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was against the law, according to several bloggers. But their ire toward the Arizona Republican relies on a hard-to-establish link to a highly politicized law that no one has ever been convicted of violating. "McCain caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country," blared the Facebook headline on several Internet posts critical of the senator on or after Feb. 3, 2017. The social media site flagged at least one undated example as part of its efforts to squash fake stories in users’ news feeds. In this case, the post isn’t fake in that details were made up, rather just inaccurate in how the details are portrayed. The posts reference an initial phone call Trump made to Turnbull on Jan. 28. That call allegedly turned sour when Trump balked over an agreement former President Barack Obama struck to take in 1,250 refugees that Australia held in offshore detention centers. But the "highly illegal phone call" that McCain made was on Feb. 2, when he contacted Australian ambassador to the United States Joe Hockey to assure Hockey of McCain’s "unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance." "I asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote," McCain said in a statement. That caused an uproar in some corners of the Internet. Several websites repurposed or made reference to an undated post that appears to originate at AngryPatriotMovement.com, which carried the same headline about McCain breaking the law. The post linked to a Feb 3 BizPacReview.com article that said McCain was "undermining" Trump, and said McCain’s call to Australia’s ambassador "might be a violation of the Logan Act." "The Logan Act says ANY citizen of the United States who ‘without permission of the United States’ either directly or indirectly ‘commences or carries on correspondence’ with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to ‘influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer’ in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years — or both," the AngryPatriotMovement.com post read. But really, McCain wasn’t "caught" doing anything. His office put out the press release about contacting Hockey. And the Logan Act isn’t necessarily a law designed to root out near-treasonous behavior, the way the blogs make it sound. The Logan Act dates back to 1798, when a Pennsylvania state legislator named George Logan went to France to negotiate a peace settlement over debts with the United States during the French Revolution, according to the Washington Post. You’ll recall Paul Giamatti agonizing over the issue in HBO’s John Adams. Adams’ Federalist Party had opposed Logan’s efforts, so they passed a law that said private citizens couldn’t work on foreign policy issues without the government allowing it. No one has ever been charged with a crime under the Logan Act, but its name comes up from time to time, usually when a lawmaker has contacted a foreign official for some purpose the opposing party doesn’t like. Some brought up the act when U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., went to Syria as Speaker of the House to attempt to wheel and deal with President Bashar al-Assad in 2007. It also was mentioned when 47 Republican senators wrote a letter to Iran in 2015 to try to scuttle Obama’s nuclear treaty. It even came up when Trump, as the GOP presidential nominee, asked Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails last year. It’s highly doubtful that McCain, who has made a habit of serving as a foil for Trump, actually violated federal law. Stanford law professor Michael McConnell doubted the Logan Act could be used to keep a senator from talking to a country’s envoy about foreign affairs, which senators often do. "So far as publicly available information indicates, Sen. McCain spoke with the Australian ambassador to assure the nation of his own unwavering support — not to influence any ‘measures or conduct,’" McConnell told us in an email. Our ruling Bloggers claim McCain was "caught making highly illegal phone call to foreign country." The claim reads as if McCain tried to break federal law by influencing a foreign official, perhaps by secrecy. That’s not the case at all, but a reader wouldn’t get that impression.

pomt-13577	"At $587 apiece, USA would need to bring home about 33.1 BILLION gold medals to pay off our national debt."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/19/scott-rigell/rep-scott-rigell-331-billion-rio-olympic-gold-meda/	U.S. Rep. Scott Rigell says paying off the national debt would require an Olympic feat. "Here’s something to think about while rooting on our U.S. Olympians: At $587 apiece, USA would need to bring home about 33.1 BILLION gold medals to pay off our national debt," Rigell, R-2nd, says on his congressional Facebook page. We asked Rigell’s office where he got the figures for his claim that billions of medals would be needed to erase the U.S. debt. Kaylin Minton, Rigell’s director of communications, pointed us to a July 31 article from CNN that said the value of the gold medal is $587. We found another estimate from Forbes magazine that said the value of the medal was $564. These figures are based on the value of the precious metal used in the top Olympic award. The medals weigh 500 grams - or just more than 1 pound. If that roughly $600 value for a pound of gold seems exceedingly low, there’s a good reason: The gold medal is made mostly of silver. Brazil’s federal government website dedicated to the games says the Rio 2016 top medal consists of 494 grams of sterling silver. The remaining 6 grams is made up of 99.9 percent pure gold. The value of a gold medal fluctuates based on the price of precious metals, which change daily. We looked at commodity prices about a week after Rigell’s statement and found the value of the precious metals was closer to $550. But the bottom line is, Rigell’s estimate of the value of a gold medal is about right for the basic smelt value. The figure does not include the $25,000 cash bonus the U.S. Olympic Committee provides to athletes for each gold medal won. It’s also worth noting that if Olympic medals are sold at auction, they could fetch a price well beyond their scrap value. Money magazine recently looked at some past gold medals that have been sold and fetched big bucks. A 1936 gold medal won by track and field star Jesse Owens sold for $1.47 million in 2013, according to the magazine. Another gold medal from an anonymous winner from the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles sold this year for $41,807. Holthouse, Carlin, Van Tright LLP, a Los Angeles-based accounting firm, said in a recent post on its website that gold medals on the open market generally fetch around $10,000. The "intrinsic monetary worth" of a gold medal - the amount an athlete would report on taxes - is based on the weight of the precious metals, or about $600, the accounting firm said. So how would that translate into paying off the national debt? Minton points to the national debt figures from the U.S. Treasury Department, which lists total national debt of $19.4 trillion. If you divide that by $587, it would translate into nearly 33.1 billion gold medals. One final point: The overall debt figure that Minton cites includes all debt, including about $5.4 trillion in intergovernmental debt that the U.S. government owes itself, such as Social Security and Medicare trust funds that are invested in Treasury securities. When looking at the size of the U.S. debt, some experts prefer tallying just the amount of debt held by the public in Treasury bills, savings bonds and obligations to foreign governments, because that’s the debt the U.S. government owes to outside entities. The publicly held debt comes to $14 trillion. If you were to divide that by the $587 medal value, that would mean it would take about 23.9 billion medals to equal the value of the U.S. debt held by the public. That’s not as high as Rigell says, but it’s still a massive number. Our ruling Rigell stated, "At $587 apiece, USA would need to bring home about 33.1 BILLION gold medals to pay off our national debt." The value of the award shifts based on the fluctuating price of the precious metals it contains. That said, the basic value of the gold medal that Rigell cites is a reasonable estimate. And that $587 cost would translate into billions of medals being needed to equal the size of the total national debt. But his statement benefits from some clarity. If you were to take into account a higher payday that an athlete could get by selling their gold medal on the open market, that amount could go well beyond the basic precious metal value of the award. That, in turn, would lower drastically the amount of medals it would take to pay off the debt. We rate his statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/beb7e209-818a-40a7-a9ec-b19feb5c94e4	None	Scott Rigell	None	None	None	2016-08-19T13:58:19	2016-08-09	['United_States', '1,000,000,000']
pomt-14761	"Most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/11/antonin-scalia/scalia-says-most-black-scientists-went-lesser-coll/	Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is taking heat for comments he made from the bench that some are calling racist. While questioning a lawyer during oral arguments in Fisher vs. University of Texas, a case that has the potential to derail affirmative action across the country, Scalia suggested that the practice might actually harm black students by putting them into a scholastic environment for which they are not academically prepared. "There are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well," Scalia said Dec. 9. "One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they’re being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them." Scalia’s comments have generated plenty of discussion. As fact-checkers, we decided to zero in on his factual claim that "most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools." Bloomberg pointed out Scalia was probably referring to a brief by University of San Diego law professor Gail Heriot and Cleveland attorney Peter Kirsanow. The pair are congressional appointees to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Their brief made the case that affirmative action is a hindrance for students admitted through affirmative action who pursue degrees in science and engineering." As evidence they pointed to a 1996 Dartmouth study that showed 40 percent of black students graduating with science and engineering degrees came from historically black colleges and universities, where students typically have lower average SAT scores and high school grades. But Scalia’s comment was broader and talked about the number of black scientists as a whole. In that regard, there is no national count of every single black scientist and where they went to school. There is some research, however, on how minority students fare as science majors at different universities. On the raw numbers, the claim is "likely to be true, but not for the reasons Scalia thinks it is," said Benjamin Backes, an affirmative action expert with the American Institutes for Research. Most black scientists likely did not go to schools like the University of Texas at Austin — that is to say, selective research universities. Why? Because the vast majority of students and science majors do not go to these elite institutions. For reference, the American Association of Universities represents 62 leading research universities, which together house just 20 percent of all undergraduate science, math and engineering majors in the United States and Canada. "Because the typical student, both black and non-black, does not attend a selective university, the typical scientist likely did not graduate from a selective institution," he said. Let’s get back to the broader point of the statement: that black students perform better in science at "lesser" schools than the University of Texas. At the crux of this debate is the mismatch theory, which is controversial to say the least. It’s the idea that affirmative action brings minority students into universities where their academic credentials are significantly lower than the typical student, and so these minority students are less likely to persist with difficult majors like science and engineering than they would have been at a less-selective school. The study that Scalia cited is almost 20 years old, but more recent research purports to support the mismatch theory. "Scalia was certainly oversimplifying, but there is a large literature on this problem," said Richard Sander, a University of California Los Angeles law professor who co-wrote a book titled Mismatch. Sander cited a recent study examining students in the University of California system that found "minority students at top-ranked campuses would, on average, have significantly higher probabilities of graduating in the sciences if they had attended lower-ranked campuses." But — here’s a taste of how contentious this theory is — Matthew Chingos, an education expert at the Urban Institute, did his own analysis of the same data and found the results to "only marginally" hold up to scrutiny and that the relationship to affirmative action was weak. In his own book, Chingos found that attending a more selective institution makes it more likely that a black student will graduate. Following Scalia’s remarks, Chingos wrote in an Urban Institute blog that Scalia’s "viewpoint withers upon closer examination" because the theory has largely been discredited by social science. A group of 11 leading experts in quantitative social science filed their own brief to the Supreme Court arguing that the Court should not consider the mismatch theory when deciding the case. The professors wrote that research in support of the theory, such as Sander's findings, "does not constitute credible evidence that affirmative action practices are harmful to minorities" because of the "significant methodological flaws on which it rests." "Essentially Scalia is presenting mismatch as fact without acknowledging the disagreement amongst researchers," Backes said, noting that he personally thinks there’s empirical support for the theory. A 2014 study, which does not take a position on affirmative action, found that an outsized portion, 30 percent, of black Ph.D. candidates in science and engineering attended a historically black college or university for their undergraduate education. Chingos said this study does not say much about the issue of affirmative action because it doesn’t say much about relative merits of minority students going to a less or more selective university. Our ruling Citing a brief, Scalia said, "Most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools." In terms of raw numbers, it’s probably true that most of the black scientists come from schools that are less selective than the University of Texas at Austin. But that’s not a statement on the effects of affirmative action. Rather, it’s because the vast majority of American college students, and thus most science majors, go to schools that are less selective than UT. Regarding the larger point — that black students fare better at "lesser" schools because their academic credentials are better matched to the curriculum — the evidence is mired in controversy. There is some scholarly research that backs up this point, but there is also scholarly research that refutes it. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-06492	Appalachian Power Company is making "record profits."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/oct/14/ward-armstrong/ward-armstrong-says-appalachian-power-coompany-mak/	House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry, is seeking to turn his reelection bid this fall into a referendum on Appalachian Power Company, which has raised rates on his Southside constituents nine times in the past four years. The outspoken Democrat is in the fight of his 20-year public career. The GOP-controlled House drew new political maps earlier this year that put Armstrong in a district with a Republican incumbent, Del. Charles Poindexter of Franklin County. Armstrong was prepared for challenge, having amassed a sizable campaign treasury and seized a powerful issue. For more than a year, Armstrong has been calling for tougher regulation of Apco and accusing the utility of bilking customers during hard times. He has portrayed Poindexter, who has not joined the condemnation, as a friend of Apco. The minority leader amplified the theme in two recent TV commercials, charging Apco has been raising rates "even though they’re making record profits." Several readers questioned whether Apco really is making record profits, so we decided to take a look. PolitiFact Virginia tried several times to contact Armstrong or his campaign manager over the last week, but our phone calls were not returned. So we turned to one of the lawmaker’s web sites, called "No More Rate Hikes," where Armstrong lays out his case against Apco. Under a section titled "Record Profits," he cites three sets of statistics. Let’s examine each: 1. "Appalachian Power reported $3.3 billion in total revenues for fiscal year 2010 -- a $385.9 million, or 13.4 percent, increase from 2008." We found similar numbers and dates in annual reports that American Electric Power -- Apco’s corporate parent -- filed with the Security and Exchange Commission. But Armstrong’s use of the figures to prove record profits is misleading. The numbers are Apco’s gross revenues; they don’t include data that also show significant increases in the utility’s operating costs over the same three years. 2. "Appalachian Power reported $136.7 million in net income for fiscal year 2010 -- a $13.8 million, or 11.2 percent increase from 2008." Net income -- revenues minus expenses and losses -- is often used as a term for profit. Armstrong’s figures, while correct, do not prove Apco made record profits. We reviewed annual reports going back to 1998 and found Apco’s high-water mark for profits came in 2003, when it reported net income of $280 million, followed by 2002 when the company posted a $205 million gain. Apco’s average annual net income for the past 13 years is $143.4 million -- higher than the $136.7 million reported in 2010, the latest figure available. Apco’s average net income over the last four years -- when, as Armstrong notes in ads, the utility has been granted nine rate increases -- is $117.5 million, well below the utility’s 13-year average. 3. "Appalachian Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEP, which reported $14.4 billion in total revenues and $1.2 billion in net income for fiscal year 2010. American Electric Power has reported record net income over the last three years, although the $1.2 billion in 2010 was down from almost $1.4 billion nets the parent corporation reaped in 2008 and 2009. Apco -- which serves about 1 million customers in Southside and Southwest Virginia, as well as West Virginia and a small portion of Tennessee -- is one of six power companies owned by AEP. Although each entity keep its own books, there’s no doubt money flows through the corporate chain. Apco, for example, does not generate enough of its own power to meet demand and is required to buy electricity from other AEP companies. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has questioned whether the purchases amount to profits for other AEP entities. But Virginia regulators do not review the profits of the parent corporation or other subsidiaries when considering Apco’s requests for rate hikes. "We look at the entity that serves Virginia, and that’s Appalachian Power," said Andy Farmer, a spokesman for the State Corporation Commission. Apco’s rates remained stable for decades, fueled by inexpensive coal burned in power plants in Ohio and West Virginia. But federal environmental regulations have tightened, forcing the company to spend $2 billion over the past five years to upgrade pollution controls. That, combined with a rise in the price of coal, has led to a 66 percent increase in Apco electric bills over the past six years. Two major bond rating agencies -- Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings -- put Apco’s credit on watch for a possible downgrade in 2008, saying the utility’s debt was rising faster than its cash flow. Fitch said Apco’s performance as an investment depended on the outcome of its rate increase requests. Apco’s credit stabilized in 2009 after receiving a $450 million infusion from its parent, AEP. Apco’s 5.45 percent return on equity between from 2008 to 2010 fell well short of the 10.53 percent the SCC has been willing to allow in setting Apco’s rates. This fall, the utility has four requests pending before the SCC that would hike residential electric bills by a total of 11 percent -- to about $105.09 a month for 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. The company is seeking an 11.15 percent return on equity. The SCC staff has recommended a base rate hike that would produce about half of the $68.5 million in new revenue Apco is requesting. Cuccinelli’s office has urged no base rate increase, saying Apco has room to lower its costs. By comparison, Dominion, Virginia’s largest electric utility, has a residential rate of $112.31 per kilowatt hour. Dominion is allowed an 11.9 percent return on equity. Our ruling: Armstrong has charged in ads that Apco, which has raised rates nine time during the last four years, is making record profits. Armstrong tries to support his statement on three legs but we find fault with each. His citing of Apco’s gross revenue is meaningless because they are not profits; his argument that Apco’s net income increased by 11.2 percent between 2008 and 2010 is misleading because profits in those years were less than half of the record set in 2003; and his emphasis on the record profits of corporate parent AEP is irrelevant because state regulators, in setting rates, focus only on Apco’s performance. Armstrong, a lawyer, has been poring over Apco’s finances for more than a year and it’s mind-boggling to suppose he's in the dark on these things. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-10740	"Mayor Giuliani's lawsuit killed the line-item veto."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/07/mitt-romney/mostly-guilty-of-killing-the-line-item-veto/	Attempting to paint former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani as a "Big City Big Spender," former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney claims Giuliani filed a lawsuit that killed the line item veto. That's true. In October 1997, Giuliani joined two labor unions and the Greater New York Hospital Association in challenging the line item veto in federal court after President Clinton nixed a provision of a budget bill that would have provided the city with as much as $2.6 billion in Medicaid funds. The Snake River Potato Growers in Idaho also challenged the law over a tax benefit that Clinton also line item vetoed. Giuliani and the others filing the suit argued—as opponents of the veto had for many years—that the Constitution required the president to either sign, veto or allow a bill to become law without his signature. The Constitution, they said, did not allow him to veto parts of a bill. The Supreme Court agreed and in June 1998, ruled that the line item veto was unconstitutional. Giuliani argues that he favors the line item veto and believes the Constitution should be amended to allow it, but he said the power cannot be created by passing a simple law. Romney is correct that Giuliani is guilty of having filed the lawsuit that killed the line item veto. But Romney neglects to say that Giuliani had several accomplices along with him.

pomt-03795	An annual income of $500,000 "in Manhattan, believe it or not, is middle class."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/27/sal-albanese/does-earning-500000-manhattan-make-you-middle-clas/	How much can you make and still be middle class if you live in Manhattan? Sal Albanese, a Democratic former city councilman running to succeed New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, raised eyebrows with his thoughts on the number during a televised forum on March 24, 2013. Albanese made the claim as he was criticizing a municipal tax proposal offered by one of his rivals, Bill Thompson, the former city comptroller. "I disagree with Bill's proposal to tax people even more in the city," Albanese said, at times interrupted by cross-talk. "As I said, what's at stake -- in Manhattan, a half a million -- half a million more in Manhattan, believe it or not, is middle class." At this point, an off-screen voice shouted, "Half a million or more is not middle class!" To some laughter, MSNBC’s moderator, Chris Hayes, said that people "are really throwing things at the television when you say that." We knew that the cost of living in the Big Apple is high. But is it really true that that an annual income of half a million dollars a year in Manhattan only makes you middle class? Unfortunately, there is no official definition of "middle class." In fact, the phrase has such a mom-and-apple-pie ring to it that politicians have been using the term expansively for generations. But we’ll look at a few methods. One is to define the upper boundary of the middle class as twice the median income. Using demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, we found that for Manhattan, the median income for all households was a little more than $66,000. Using this definition, the upper limit of the middle class would be $132,000 -- well short of $500,000. The second way is to break the population into three broad categories. The bottom fifth would be lower-income, the middle 60 percent would be middle-income, and the top fifth would be high-income. Census data shows that the someone who makes $200,000 ranks in the top 16 percent of Manhattan earners. So a household could make it into the top 20 percent with roughly $180,000 -- which once again is well short of $500,000. Just to be sure that Manhattan wasn’t an unusual case due to its high cost of living, we also tried to factor the Big Apple’s famously high costs. We used a city cost-of-living calculator provided by CNNMoney.com that accounts for the costs of food, housing, utilities, transportation and health care in different cities. The calculator allowed us to determine what income in other cities was equivalent to $500,000 in Manhattan. We found a handful of cities in which $500,000 in Manhattan money worked out to roughly $200,000 in local income -- Birmingham, Ala.; Tulsa, Okla.; Tampa; Cincinnati; Detroit; Charleston, W.Va.; Salt Lake City; Des Moines, Iowa; and Phoenix. Using Census data, we found that in each of these cities, the percentage of local households earning $200,000 ranged between 1 percent and 5 percent. This confirms that in this far-flung sampling of cities, earning the local equivalent of $500,000 in "Manhattan money" puts you in the top 5 percent of local earners. Even by the most generous definition, that’s not close to middle-class status. When we contacted Albanese’s campaign, a spokesman backed off the claim. Todd Brogan said Albanese got carried away during the televised appearance and defined middle class in a way he normally does not. "It was quite frankly, a gaffe," Brogan said. Brogan added that the campaign had not made its backtrack official until PolitiFact asked about it. Our ruling Albanese said that an annual income of $500,000 "in Manhattan, believe it or not, is middle class." In reality, the upper boundary of "middle class" in Manhattan is probably between $130,000 and $180,000, which is well short of the level Albanese cited (a level he later backed away from). We rate the claim False.	None	Sal Albanese	None	None	None	2013-03-27T13:32:49	2013-03-24	['Manhattan']
pomt-07161	"We have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/13/reince-priebus/rnc-chair-reince-priebus-says-todays-long-term-une/	During a June 12, 2011, face-off between party chairs on NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus compared the unemployment situation since the start of the past recent recession to what the nation faced during the Great Depression. Priebus invoked the Great Depression twice during the joint interview with Democratic counterpart, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida. The first instance came as Priebus was parrying questions about why he has failed to call for the resignation of Sen. David Vitter, R-La., after Vitter was implicated in a prostitution scandal. (The topic came up because the day before Meet the Press aired, Wasserman Schultz had been among several Democratic House leaders to call for the resignation of Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., who is embroiled in a scandal for texting sexually suggestive photos to young women.) Priebus said, in part, "Look, I'm not defending these guys, but the fact of the matter is, we have big issues here to tackle in this country. We have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression. We have gas prices that are out of this world. We have crushing debt. We know what's happening to this economy. And here's the problem. It's not so much as much as 'the economy, stupid,' as people say, it's 'the policy's stupid' too. And the president's policies in regard to saving this country, getting our economy back on track are not working." The second instance came when Priebus sought to counter Wasserman Schultz’s defense of President Barack Obama’s economic record. Addressing host David Gregory, Priebus said, "The chairwoman's living in Fantasyland. We know that the facts are the facts, and we can't get away from that. And Barack Obama is defenseless to the truth on what's going on in the American economy. We have lost as--two and a half million jobs since Barack Obama's been president. And of that two and a half million jobs, almost 45 percent of those people have been out of work for six months. That number, that number rivals the Great Depression." We perceive these two references to the Great Depression as related, but distinct, so we’ll take them in turn. First, is it fair to say that "we have unemployment that rivals the Great Depression"? As bad as the unemployment situation is currently -- and it’s unquestionably bad -- there’s little statistical support that it "rivals" the situation that existed during the Great Depression. Before we analyze this further, we will mention a caveat. The current system for measuring the unemployment rate began shortly after World War II. The methodology used during the Great Depression was similar, but not identical. One difference is that post-war statistics are available on a monthly basis, whereas Depression-era statistics are available only on an annual basis. Another is that the 1930’s data includes those age 14 and up, not 16 as today. We asked several economists whether the differences in methodology suggest that it’s inaccurate to compare the old-fashioned statistics to the current ones. They agreed that comparisons are appropriate as long as the differences are disclosed. So, what did the unemployment rate look like during the Great Depression? 1930: 8.7 percent 1931: 15.9 percent 1932: 23.6 percent 1933: 24.9 percent 1934: 21.7 percent 1935: 20.1 percent 1936: 16.9 percent 1937: 14.3 percent 1938: 19.0 percent 1939: 17.2 percent 1940: 14.6 percent 1941: 9.9 percent And how does that compare to today? The current monthly unemployment rate -- for May 2011 -- is 9.1 percent. Since the onset of the current recession in December 2007, unemployment has spiked as high as 10.1 percent, in October 2009. And the annual unemployment rates for 2009 and 2010 -- perhaps the closest analogue to the Depression-era statistics -- are 9.3 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. Any way you cut it, peak unemployment since the start of the most recent recession, as bad as it has been, remains well under half of the peak it reached during the Great Depression. For more than a decade, annual unemployment never fell below 14.3 percent, or a level about 40 percent higher than the worst of what we’ve seen recently. Any suggestion that the two situations are equivalent requires herculean cherry picking. So Priebus is wrong on the first claim. But what about the second -- that "almost 45 percent of (the unemployed) have been out of work for six months," a number that "rivals the Great Depression"? Priebus is correct on the current figure. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 45.1 percent of unemployed workers have been jobless for at least 27 weeks. That’s not the highest rate in recent months, but it’s in line with historically high levels. But Priebus’ comparison has a problem: We couldn’t find any equivalent data from the Great Depression, and the economists we spoke to weren’t aware of any either. The only place we saw this claim made came in a CBS News story from June 5, 2011, which said that "45.1 percent of all unemployed workers in this country have been jobless for more than six months -- a higher percentage than during the Great Depression." When we checked with the CBS reporter, Ben Tracy, he told us that there had been an error in the story due to some garbled relaying of information and that a corrected version of the story had been ordered. At PolitiFact, our policy is that citing a news account does not protect a statement from being ruled False if it turns out that news account is inaccurate. When we contacted the RNC, we were told that the notion that unemployment "rivals the Great Depression" is valid since there are 13.9 million unemployed Americans today, according to BLS, compared to a maximum of 12.8 million unemployed Americans during the Great Depression, specifically in 1933. "‘Rivals’ would be the right characterization," the RNC said in a statement. "Chairman Priebus did not cite the ‘unemployment rate," as PolitiFact did in its query. But we think this is a ridiculous comparison, since the population of the United States was 123 million then, compared to nearly 309 million today. On the second point, the RNC said it had been referring to the CBS News story, but also pointed to a 1984 paper from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that said that "the 1981-82 recession resulted in levels of long-term unemployment far higher than any experienced since the Great Depression," specifically 25.7 percent. In an e-mail to PolitiFact, the RNC argued that "today, chronic unemployment of 27 weeks or longer is 45.1 percent. As BLS itself cited the Great Depression in talking about a chronic unemployment rate almost half of what it is today, we think it’s more than fair for Chairman Priebus to make the Great Depression comparison in reference to today’s numbers." We disagree. Just because BLS in 1984 said that the 1981-1982 recession "resulted in levels of long-term unemployment far higher than any experienced since the Great Depression" doesn’t mean that nearly doubling the rate brings it to levels that "rival" the Great Depression. The fact that the recent recession was the worst since the Great Depression doesn't mean that it "rivals" the Great Depression in severity. The fact is, the RNC can’t point to any statistic that makes its point. Maybe it’s true, but with the disappearance of the erroneous CBS report, there is no evidence for it. More broadly, both liberal and conservative economists expressed skepticism about Priebus’ comparison of the recent recession and the Great Depression. "The pre-World War II statistics are, at best, very sketchy, so people have a lot of ability to make claims that are hard to verify or debunk," said Daniel Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. He added that, in his view, "the unemployment rate assertion seems a bit farfetched. I suppose Priebus also could be looking at the broader measures of unemployment, some of which have been north of 15 percent for quite some time. But we don't have any comparable figures for the 1930s, so that's uncharted territory." Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, agreed that he sees no "sound factual basis" for either of Priebus’ two claims. However, he said it’s important to remember that the statistics we have suggest that the most recent recession has been the worst since the Great Depression. So where does this leave us? Today’s jobs picture is the worst it has been in decades, not just measured by unemployment rates but also by duration of unemployment. However, all of the available statistics -- imperfect though they may be -- suggest that today’s numbers aren’t anywhere near high enough to "rival" those that prevailed for more than a decade during the Great Depression. We rate Priebus’ statement False.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2011-06-13T15:28:39	2011-06-12	['None']
pomt-13146	"One of George Soros' companies has provided some of the (voting) machines" for some states.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/31/sean-duffy/wisconsin-congressman-fuels-soros-voting-machine-r/	How do you spread a rumor without taking responsibility for spreading it? By saying you don’t vouch for its accuracy — yet. That’s what Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., did on CNN on the topic of vote rigging. In an interview on the Situation Room, Duffy said he didn’t have evidence of "widespread problems across the country," but he went out of his way to relay some troubling reports. "Articles that I have read, I haven't verified them," Duffy told host Wolf Blitzer on Oct. 27, 2016. "But we heard that one of George Soros' companies has provided some of the machines for some of these states. And, obviously, Mr. Soros leans left. I haven't personally verified that yet." Duffy’s comment is notable because the claim had been debunked a week before he appeared on CNN by Snopes, and again three days before by the Washington Post. The claim about billionaire Soros emerged on several conservative websites. One Daily Caller report said, "Smartmatic, a U.K.-based voting technology company with deep ties to George Soros, has provided voting technology in 16 states including battleground zones like Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia." The article noted that Smartmatic stated on its website that it "will not be deploying its technology in any U.S. county for the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential elections." That nuance was lost on many people. More than 125,000 signed a petition posted Oct. 21, 2016, on the White House website that said, "We the people ask Congress to meet in emergency session about removing George Soros-owned voting machines from 16 states." To be clear, abundant evidence shows that Soros owns no voting machines in the United States. To go further, the link between Soros and Smartmatic is gossamer thin. Company CEO Antonio Mugica and chairman Lord Mark Malloch-Brown said in a statement, "George Soros has zero ownership or involvement in our company. Smartmatic has no ties to political parties or groups in any country and it abides by a strict code of ethics that forbids the company from donating to any political campaigns of any kind." The one connection between Soros and Malloch-Brown is that Malloch-Brown sits on the global board of Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Malloch-Brown is a former minister of State in the British cabinet and, as the Smartmatic website stated, he is a member of "a number of non-profit boards addressing global issues from poverty reduction to conflict resolution." On top of all this, no state is using Smartmatic machines in this election. The Verified Voting Foundation, a group founded by a Stanford computer scientist to promote accuracy in voting, tracks all companies that provide voting equipment in the United States. Smartmatic has no such equipment in any state. (Hat-tip to Snopes, the internet rumor-zapping website that first dug into this.) The Utah Republican Party used a Smartmatic system in the 2016 primary, and Los Angeles County tested one element for provisional and mail-in ballots. All of this information was available before Duffy’s interview. (In addition to Snopes and the Washington Post, investigative journalism website ProPublica also debunked the idea.) Duffy’s communications director Mark Bednar said, "Congressman Duffy didn't claim anything in particular and merely spoke about what people have been recently discussing throughout the nation." Our ruling Duffy said that there were unverified reports that a George Soros company was providing voting machines in certain states. In the week before Duffy said that, those reports had been fully discredited three times. Soros owns no company that offers voting machines, and the company named in the rumor has no voting machines in the United States. To call a baseless rumor "unverified" after it has been thoroughly debunked twists the meaning of the word. We rate this claim Pants On Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74ea2227-cd2b-4e4b-9f20-8f2af7d27807	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2016-10-31T17:06:10	2016-10-27	['George_Soros']
pomt-09680	Obama has admitted a cap and trade plan would cause electricity bills to "skyrocket."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/16/sarah-palin/obama-said-cap-and-trade-would-increase-electricit/	In her new book, Going Rogue , Sarah Palin said President Barack Obama's support for a cap and trade plan was "misguided." "The president has already admitted that the policy he seeks will cause our electricity bills to 'skyrocket.' Sadly, those hit hardest will be those who are already struggling to make ends meet," she wrote. Here, we're looking at Obama's comments on electricity bills. First, though, here's a quick summary of cap and trade for those who aren't famliar with it: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies can buy and sell the credits as necessary to conduct their business. We were familiar with Obama's original quote from his campaign for president. It came from a videotaped interview he did with the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board very early in the campaign in January 2008. "Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket," Obama told the Chronicle . "Coal-powered plants, you know, natural gas, you name it, whatever the plants were, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their operations. That will cost money. They will pass that money on to consumers." Obama also said the biggest challenge would be making sure voters understand why such a plan is necessary. "The problem is, can you get the American people to say this is really important," Obama said. Obama was talking in general about cap and trade, but there is now a specific bill making its way through Congress, written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. The latest version of the bill includes a number of measures to offset higher utility bills for consumers. Revenue from the permits would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. Legislators have opted to give 85 percent of the polluting permits away for free instead of putting them up for sale, as Obama pledged to do on the campaign trail. In theory, this approach should reduce costs to consumers. So how much would rates go up for consumers? It's hard to say. There has been much debate about the costs, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our Pants on Fire rating. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. So the climate debate has changed substantially since Obama sat down with the Chronicle nearly two years ago. Despite those potential cost cuts, there's still little disagreement that consumers will pay for cap-and-trade, whether it's $3,100 a year or $340. Because that hasn't changed since Obama first said that utility rates would "necessarily skyrocket," and because Palin got Obama's words right, we give Palin a True.

Tim Kaine tweeted out a geography quiz on a recent visit to Southwestern Virginia. "When I stood at Pinnacle Overlook above the Cumberland Gap today, I was closer to 8 other state capitals than to Richmond," Kaine wrote on Aug. 20. "Can you name them?" The Pinnacle Overlook is part of the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park in the Southwest corner of Virginia. Sitting 2,440 feet high, it offers scenic views of three states: Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee. Jon Baliles, the first district city councilman in Richmond, took up Kaine’s challenge and on Twitter rattled off a list of state capitals that are closer to the overlook than Richmond: Frankfort, Ky.; Nashville, Tenn.; Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta; Columbia, S.C.; Indianapolis; Raleigh, N.C.; and Charleston, W.V. Kaine sent a congratulatory tweet to Baliles. "Well done! You got them all," Kaine wrote. We took the quiz, too, and got a different answer. There were actually nine state capitals that were closer to where Kaine was standing than Richmond. The senator and the councilman omitted Montgomery, Ala. We checked the driving distance between various state capitals and the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, measuring by the most direct route recommended by Google Maps: Frankfort, Ky. -- 162 miles Nashville, Tenn. -- 226 miles Charleston, W.V. -- 228 miles Atlanta -- 272 miles Columbia, SC -- 289 miles Indianapolis -- 315 miles Columbus, Ohio -- 318 miles Raleigh, NC -- 342 miles Montgomery, Ala. -- 387 miles Richmond, Va. -- 417 miles We also used an "as the crow flies" straight line measurement between the Pinnacle Overlook and various state capitals, using daftlogic.com. Although the distances changed, the number of closer state capitals did not. Frankfort -- 129 miles Charleston -- 164 miles Nashville -- 176 miles Atlanta -- 202 miles Columbia -- 234 miles Columbus -- 235 miles Indianapolis -- 257 miles Raleigh -- 287 miles Montgomery -- 329 miles Richmond -- 350 miles Our ruling Kaine says Pinnacle Overlook in far Southwestern Virginia is closer to eight state capitals than Richmond.

pomt-14585	Says Goldman Sachs CEO said Congress would "have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/05/bernie-sanders/sanders-points-goldman-sachs-ceo-evidence-wall-str/	In front of a cheering audience in Keene, N.H., on Tuesday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sounded some familiar themes: reducing income inequality and increasing access to health care and education. During his speech at the Colonial Theatre in the college town, Sanders also focused on Wall Street banks, which he blamed for harming the economy. He highlighted the leadership of one firm in particular. "Two years ago, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, who himself is a billionaire, came to Washington and said, ‘You know what, you in Congress are going to have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations,’" Sanders said. In the context of the candidate’s stump speech, he was trying to point out how financiers were out to undercut everyday Americans. (At the Jan. 17 debate, Sanders made a different, shorter version of the statement, which was dinged by Politifact Texas.) But was his statement in Keene true? Did the leader of Goldman Sachs actually make a statement to that effect? We decided to check it out. When asked for supporting documentation, the Sanders campaign passed along a number of articles about Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein’s efforts in 2012 to push the U.S. Congress and President Obama toward a deal averting the so-called fiscal cliff. In case you’ve forgotten, the fiscal cliff was the combination of automatic tax increases -- some $500 billion -- and spending cuts scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2013. Most economists agreed that the cliff would cause a brief recession, which business leaders were keen to avoid. What was Blankfein’s role in this? According to the Washington Post, he and other executives who were part of a group called Fix the Debt held private meetings with legislators and the president on Nov. 28, 2012. "The group’s chief executives include such corporate leaders as Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Mark Bertolini of Aetna," the Post wrote. So Sanders’s timing is off. Blankfein wasn’t in Washington doing such lobbying two years ago; he was actually there more than three years ago. But what about the senator’s claim that the executive warned of the need for entitlement program cuts and tax breaks for the wealthy? FIx the Debt’s aims in 2012 were, broadly speaking, to encourage lawmakers to both restrain grown in entitlement spending and change the tax code to bring in more revenue. According to the Post, some members of the group also advocated for cutting corporate taxes and taxes on overseas profits for businesses. But Sanders didn’t talk about Fix the Debt, or about the other members of the group. He mentioned Blankfein specifically. So what was the CEO thinking in late 2012? There are no transcripts of what was said during the private meetings, but Sanders’s campaign sent along an excerpt from a Blankfein appearance on the CBS Evening News from Nov. 19, 2012. And during an interview with anchor Scott Pelley, the financier made it clear that his position was nuanced. Overall, he said, entitlement programs including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid would need to be altered. "The retirement age has to be changed, maybe some of the benefits have to be affected, maybe some of the inflation adjustments have to be revised," he said. "But in general, entitlements have to be slowed down and contained." Blankfein wasn’t calling for outright cuts to these programs. He was asking that their growth be slowed, something that other politicians have proposed. Even President Obama at one point offered a proposal slowing the growth of Social Security payments. That said, reasonable people can -- and do -- disagree about whether slowing the growth of a government program amounts to a cut. Meanwhile, the CEO also called for the wealthy to pay more in taxes -- a concept Sanders agrees with. BLANKFEIN: In the long run, there has to be more revenue. And, of course, the burden of that revenue will be disproportionately taken up by wealthier people. That's just logical. PELLEY: So higher taxes on wealthier people? BLANKFEIN: More taxes on wealthier people, to the extent that we need to raise more revenue, and we do need to raise some more revenue. Blankfein didn’t address corporate taxes in the interview. But in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Nov. 13, 2012, he called for businesses to work with government to lower those tax rates, noting that President Obama also supported the move. Sanders’s campaign highlighted Blankfein’s membership in the Business Roundtable group, which just last year supported a number of proposals to lower and reform business taxes. Our ruling Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told an audience in Keene that the CEO of Goldman Sachs said that Congress would "have to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give huge tax breaks to the wealthy and the large corporations." Goldman’s CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, did call for slowing the growth of entitlement spending, which may -- or may not -- legitimately be called a "cut." The CEO also supported lowering corporate taxes, though Sanders leaves out that he also said taxes would likely need to be raised on the wealthiest people to create more revenue.

pomt-07400	On redistricting.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/29/richard-saslaw/dick-saslaw-said-senate-would-not-alter-its-redist/	As is almost always the case with a legislature divided, this year’s General Assembly redistricting process was agonizing and fraught with drama. The legislature’s first stab at new election maps was vetoed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. He said districts proposed for the state Senate did not pass constitutional muster for compactness and preserving the concept of one-man, one-vote. The plan, which the chamber’s Democratic majority drew, would have lumped four Republican senators into two districts. McDonnell said little about about the portion of the bill that set new districts for the House of Delegates. That plan, drawn by the House Republican majority, squeezed several Democrats out of their districts, including Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry. House Republican responded to the governor’s overall veto by saying they would tweak their part of the redistricting plan. But Senate Democrats were defiant. "We are not going to change one period or one comma," Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, declared on April 16. Saslaw said the Senate plan was constitutional and threatened to take the matter to court. Now, fast forward to April 27, when legislators reached a tentative deal on a new plan leaving Democrats in control of the Senate, but unlike the original plan, weakening their chances of adding to the 22-18 majority. Confronted with his original statement of stubbornness, Saslaw conceded that plenty of periods and commas had been changed in those two weeks and he’d changed his tune. "I lied," he joked. "It was an unrealistic choice of words ... both sides gave a little." Well, that makes our life easy. In the heat of battle, the ever-fiery Saslaw was obstinate and braced for tough negotiations. But in the end, cooler heads prevailed and he acknowledged that his remarks had been bombast. Still, it represents a 180-degree reversal. Full Flop!

pomt-14246	"Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels."	true	/texas/statements/2016/apr/12/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-wind-power-cheaper-texas-power-d/	Barack Obama, exhorting Dallas Democrats during a March 2016 Texas swing, called Republican claims that the country and planet are in sorry shape a "false narrative." "America is pretty darn great right now," the Democratic president said. And among great things, Obama said, Democrats believe in science and that climate change is real -- and that wind is a better bargain in Texas than traditional oil and gas. Come again? "Right now, here in Texas," Obama said, "wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels." Wind power sure has sizzle. In 2015, PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., found Mostly True Obama’s claim that "America is No. 1 in wind power." China led in overall wind-power capacity but the U.S. was generating more electricity from the wind. Earlier, in 2010, we rated True a declaration that Texas had "installed more wind power than any other state, and all but four countries." As of 2009, Texas boasted 9,410 megawatts of wind power — enough to power two million homes. More recently, FactCheck.org, based at the University of Pennsylvania, dug into Obama’s claim in his 2016 State of the Union address that "in fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power." Nationally, average coal and gas prices were running less than average wind power costs. Yet in Iowa and Texas, wind energy proved cheaper, according to an Energy Information Administration analyst. Meantime, an American Wind Energy Association blog post talking up Obama’s Iowa-Texas SOTU claim noted a 2015 study by Lazard LLC, a financial services firm, stating the cost of wind production in Texas, not counting government subsidies, runs from $36 to $51 per megawatt-hour while an average national cost for coal-fired electricity ranges from $65 to $150 per MWh and for gas, depending on the type of plant, from $52/MWh to $218/MWh. White House cites DOE report We asked the White House about the basis of Obama’s statement in Dallas. By email, spokesman Frank Benenati said a federal report shows that in 2014, the "average executed price of wind power purchase agreements" was $23.50 per MWh and according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a non-governmental outfit, "the levelized cost of energy from wind in Iowa and Texas, even without subsidies, is lower than the" levelized cost of energy "of coal at $59/MWh." Congress in 2015 extended the federal Production Tax Credit for five years. That action, recapped in North American Wind Power, means "wind developers" get a credit of $23 per MWh for electricity generated to the power grid though the credit is set to diminish from 2017 through 2019. The U.S. Department of Energy’s latest annual report on wind technologies, which affirms Texas as the No. 1 wind-power state, states that based on research compiled by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the "national average levelized price of wind PPAs," or Power Purchase Agreements, "that were signed in 2014 (and that are within the Berkeley Lab sample) fell to around $23.50/MWh nationwide—a new low, but admittedly focused on a sample of projects that largely hail from the lowest-priced Interior region of the country." Absent from the report: A direct wind-to-fossil-fuel cost comparison, though the report says that based on the agency’s sample, "wind PPA prices are most competitive with wholesale power prices in the Interior region. The average price stream of wind PPAs executed in 2013 or 2014 also compares favorably to a range of projections of the fuel costs of gas-fired generation extending out through 2040." The Interior region takes in the middle-of-the-country states running north from the Texas-Mexico border to Canada. Levelized costs represent the per-MWh cost (in inflation-adjusted dollars) of building and operating a generating plant over an assumed financial life and duty cycle, the EIA says, counting capital and fuel costs, fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs, financing costs and "an assumed utilization rate for each plant type." So, Obama’s claim has a basis. Still, the report also cautions against comparing long-time purchase agreement prices for wind with shorter-term fluctuating prices of electricity from fossil fuels like coal. An "important note" says the presented prices don’t reflect "the full social costs of power generation and delivery." That is, the report says, the cited wind purchase agreement prices are driven down by federal and, sometimes, state tax and financial incentives. Also, the wind prices don’t "fully reflect integration, resource adequacy or transmission costs," the report says. On the other hand, the note continues, "wholesale electricity prices (or fuel cost projections) do not fully reflect transmission costs, may not fully reflect capital and fixed operating costs and are reduced by virtue of any financial incentives provided to fossil-fueled generation and its fuel production cycle as well as by not fully accounting for the environmental and social costs of that generation." "In addition, wind PPA prices—once established—are fixed and known, whereas wholesale electricity prices are short term and therefore subject to change over time," the note says. "Finally, the location of the wholesale electricity nodes and the assumption of a flat block of power are not perfectly consistent with the location and output profile of the sample of wind power projects. In short, comparing levelized long-term wind PPA prices with either yearly wholesale electricity prices or forecasts of the fuel costs of natural gas-fired generation is not appropriate if one’s goal is to account fully for the costs and benefits of wind energy relative to its competition. Nonetheless, these comparisons still provide some sense for the short-term competitive environment facing wind energy, and how that environment has shifted with time." Energy department cites Bloomberg report Like Benenati, Dawn Selak, an energy department spokeswoman, told us the estimated cost of coal in 2015 was around $59/MWh, a figure she attributed to Bloomberg research. So, Selak said, "the cost of wind (including in Texas) is less than the cost of coal even with the $23/MWh" tax credit factored in. In a February 2016 report prepared for the pro-wind-power Business Council for Sustainable Energy, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said: "Wind in Texas is among the cheapest in the country, with an unsubsidized levelized cost of electricity of around $50/MWh, due to high capacity factors (>50%) and low cost to build." Capacity factor refers to the share of time a turbine (or plant) is actively generating power. A Bloomberg analyst, Stephen Munro, told us by phone and email that Obama was essentially correct per the latest costs of wind power generation in the Texas Panhandle. "Since 2013," Munro wrote, "we have observed that the cost of new Power Purchase Agreements for wind energy has fallen below the average around-the-clock wholesale prices in the wholesale pool that covers much of the wind power generation in the Panhandle. Average around-the-clock wholesale prices include power generated from fossil fuels, renewable sources and uranium. "As of the second half of 2015," Munro wrote, "we observed a levelised cost of power of $43/MWh in PPAs for wind in the utility region including much of the Texas Panhandle." In comparison, Munro said, coal-fired electricity was costing $74.70 per MWh in most of East Texas and the Panhandle as well as Kansas plus parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas and Louisiana. Munro said the wholesale price of wind-fueled power is "notably lower" in the Panhandle and other parts of the region "because that region features an extraordinary wind resource and because the costs of land and construction are lower than elsewhere. Developers have taken advantage of this to install advanced, large capacity turbines." That is, it’s way windy a lot up over there, we (or maybe someone from Fort Worth) would put it. Texas analysts We also ran Obama’s statement past a staff spokeswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the flow of electricity to most Texans. By email, Robbie Searcy said she’d grant the claim credence. a Mostly True rating. "Within the ERCOT real-time wholesale energy market," Searcy said, "all generation that is used in any interval technically clears at the same price, which is the highest price of all resources used to serve demand in each load zone at that time. During periods of high wind output," she said, "wind generation resources are able to offer power into the market at very low, and sometimes negative, prices. This in turn drives down the settlement point prices for all resources operating during those intervals, especially when demand is low." At our request, Searcy emailed a chart showing wind, coal and natural gas electricity "price offers" in ERCOT’s market at 7 a.m. Jan. 22, 2016. At that time, the chart indicates, coal and gas offers were priced higher than wind. She said the date was the most recent day of available public data when we inquired and agency experts chose the hour to reflect the period when demand, and therefore generation, peaked. Searcy said wholesale market prices at 7 a.m. that day were "about $26.70 per MWh on average among all resources used at the time." At that time, she said, average offers from gas-fired power producers were $23.37/MWh compared to $14.14 per MWh for coal and a negative $23.89 for wind power. (Perhaps wind power producers could afford that thanks to the federal subsidy.) Searcy said too it’s worth remembering that when "we talk about natural gas-fired resources, that covers a broad range of technologies and efficiency levels, from older steam units to more modern combined-cycle units to quick-start combustion turbines." The case for coal Even if Texas wind power may be cheaper for electricity than traditional fuels, other authorities told us there’s at least one smart reason to keep the other fuels handy. Winds can die down, keeping turbines from spinning. At the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas producers, Lauren Hamner, spokeswoman for Commissioner Christi Craddick, said by email that it’s worth remembering a coal-fired plant is capable of running longer at all hours than a breeze-dependent wind turbine -- so power capacity, she said, should be folded into any comparison. Similarly, Russ Keene, Austin-based spokesman for the Balanced Energy for Texas Coalition, which says it represents consumers and coal producers, transporters and industrial users, pointed out a June 2015 study by the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Energy Research, a free-market think tank. The study seems an outlier in saying that when "all known costs" are considered, the average U.S. cost of producing electricity from established coal-fired plants is far less than new wind-power generation. Still, we asked its lead author, Tom Stacy, to evaluate Obama’s claim. By email, Stacy said the president didn’t acknowledge that an established plant fueled by coal, gas or nuclear power can be available at all hours and that’s just not so for wind-dependent generators. It stands to reason, he indicated, that wind-generated electricity can’t (or shouldn’t) be price-compared to electricity generated by fossil fuels or nuclear sources. Availability at all times aside, we wondered, is it also so that wind-fueled power is lately cheaper in Texas than power drawn from fossil fuels? "And dog meat in China is cheaper than Kobe beef in NYC," Stacy wrote, "but it isn't the same thing, is it?" Our ruling Obama, in Dallas, said: "Right now, here in Texas, wind power is already cheaper than dirty fossil fuels." Wind-generated electricity is offered for sale in Texas at lower prices than power fired by coal or natural gas. Unsaid: wind power, unlike electricity fueled by oil or gas, isn’t always available.

pomt-07141	Says President Barack Obama "has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/15/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-barack-obama-has-raised-stop-si/	During Monday’s Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Sen. Rick Santorum blasted President Barack Obama’s policies on oil drilling. Santorum said that Obama "has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska, and that is depressing. We need to drill. We need to create energy jobs." We took a look at a similar statement in March, when Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. -- another GOP presidential contender -- told an audience at a conservative conference that "the number of new drilling permits under the Obama Administration since they came into office" is "one." We ruled that statement Pants on Fire. We’ll refer back to our discussion of that claim here, updating it with more current information. The most recent summary from Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE -- the federal agency that oversees drilling -- is included in a document titled the "Status of Well Permits and Plans Subject to Enhanced Safety and Environmental Requirements." The report says that 56 shallow-water permits for new wells have been issued since June 8, 2010, when new rules and information requirements were put into effect following the BP oil spill. Shallow-water drilling operations were not affected by the deep-water drilling moratorium following the spill. In addition, since February of this year -- following the lifting of the moratorium and confirmation of the industry's ability to meet subsea containment requirements -- the government has approved 48 deep-water permits requiring subsea containment, covering 16 unique wells. Another 40 permits not requiring subsea containment have also been approved since October. The operators were required to come back and meet the modified standards. So there’s been movement on offshore permits in the Gulf of Mexico under Obama. What about drilling elsewhere? Arctic Ocean exploratory drilling permits continue to wend their way through the permitting process at the Department of Interior, said Richard Charter, a senior policy adviser for the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. A chart from BOEMRE confirms that no new offshore wells have been drilled in Alaska since Obama took office. However, only one such well has been drilled in the past dozen years, including eight years when a Republican, George W. Bush was president. So the shortage of drilling in Alaska is not exclusively an Obama-related problem. Obama did announce in May that he was directing the Interior Department to conduct annual lease sales in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve. He also ordered a speed-up of seismic surveys of mid- and south-Atlantic coasts and new incentives for industry to develop unused leases both on and offshore. We should note that while drilling permits haven’t disappeared entirely, the pace of approval has slowed, in large part because Obama has made clear that he wants drilling to be done safely and in an environmentally sensitive fashion. Lee Hunt, executive director of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said in March that there has been a "molasses effect" with permitting by the Obama Administration. Even shallow-water permits have fallen from their prior level, despite not being directly affected by the post-spill moratorium. Meanwhile, permits for deep-water wells are likely to be a third of what was projected prior to the gulf spill. Andy Radford, senior policy adviser at the American Petroleum Institute, agreed that permit approvals dropped after the BP spill, but he added in March that the pace of permitting was picking up. "We'll get to the new normal eventually," he said. All in all, then, Santorum’s claim is incorrect. "None of this could be accurately even remotely characterized as a ‘stop sign,’" said Charter of Defenders of Wildlife. We agree. It’s true that the Obama Administration pulled back the reins after the BP spill. But the administration has continued approving shallow-water wells, and it began to approve deep-water wells again after the moratorium was lifted six months ago. Just because the pace isn’t as fast as some would like doesn’t mean that Obama "has put (up) a stop sign … against oil drilling, against any kind of exploration offshore or in Alaska." At most, it would be a yellow light, and Santorum’s claim -- referring to curbs on "any kind" of exploration -- is over-broad. So we rate Santorum’s claim False.

pomt-01278	Dave Brat said "the best way to fix Social Security would be to give seniors back what they paid in and no more."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/nov/02/jack-trammell/trammell-brat-says-seniors-should-get-back-what-on/	Democratic Congressional candidate Jack Trammell says David Brat, his GOP opponent, is proposing to cut Social Security benefits. "David said the best way to fix Social Security would be to give seniors back what they paid in and no more," Trammell says in a TV ad. Trammell and Brat are facing off for the 7th Congressional District seat, previously held by Eric Cantor. Libertarian James Carr is also in the race. With the election looming, we thought Trammell’s statement was worth reviewing. When we asked for proof that Brat made the statement, Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for Trammell, pointed us to a May video of Brat addressing the Mechanicsville Tea Party. Brat said Social Security and other programs need big cuts: "And it’s not just little marginal changes, right, in order to avoid those insolvency issues with Medicare and Social Security, you’re going to have to do some major cuts," Brat told the crowd. "And so that’s what politicians aren’t willing to say, right? We’re going to have to take some bad medicine coming up. And so we’re going to at least have to just balance the budget." Brat went on to say people will have to work longer before receiving benefits from the major federal entitlement programs. "And then you’re going to have to increase the working age, right? Social Security and Medicare and these weren’t intended to be retirement programs. These were intended to be disaster prevention for seniors, and I’m all for that. Right? But it’s in the worst case scenario. It’s not been 65, get to retirement – the average death age back then was 65, so it broke even. Now the average death age is 80. Right? So can you pay everyone in the country a huge chunk of money for 15 additional years? No. That’s why it’s insolvent. That’s the beginning." We also found a video of Brat answering questions after a speech at Life Church in Mechanicsville in April. A man in the audience noted the Social Security Disability Trust Fund is expected to be depleted in 2016 if Congress doesn’t take steps to foster it, and he asked Brat what his response would be if benefits were cut. Brat: My general answer is we have to do what’s fair. Right? And so, you put together a graph or a chart and you go out to the American people and you go to the podium and you say, ‘This is what you put in, on average. This is what you get out, on average.’ Currently, seniors are getting about $3 out of all of the programs for every $1 they put in. So, in general, I think you’ve got to go to the American people and just be honest with them and say, "Here’s what fairness would look like." So maybe in the next 10 years, we have to grandfather some folks in, but basically we’re going to move in a direct line toward fairness and we have to live within our means. Questioner: Fairness in that sense is defined as you get what is coming in and no more? Brat: Right. That’s what I’m aiming at. The questioner noted that would lead to benefits cuts in the disability program he cited. Brat: Right and I wouldn’t want that to impact people without it being announced. But that’s the downside of -- it’s not my fault that we’re there, right? It’s the current folks’ fault that we’re there, so my answer is I would never have let us get into that place in the first place. So that’s – what would you do – when Congress is about to hit a brick wall, what would you do? I mean, hit the brakes or something. On Brat’s basic point, the 2014 Social Security trustees’ report says that the retirement piece of the program now uses more than just the designated tax income and will run out of reserves to redeem and pay for the entire entitlement in 2033. Flowers, Trammell’s spokeswoman, said Brat’s position has changed over time as he moderated his message for the general election. But he certainly showed support for grandfathering in the April talk and reiterated it in a June interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "We must keep our promise to seniors who are near retirement or are already receiving benefits," Brat told the Times-Dispatch Editorial Board. "Virginians who entrusted their hard-earned money to the Social Security trust fund must receive the benefits to which they are entitled. For younger Virginians, entitlement reform is critical in order to ensure the solvency of Medicare and Social Security." In a recent article, Brat said he supported raising the retirement age by five years. Trammell said he would be willing to raise it by two years. Here’s what Gottstein told us Brat supports: A grandfather clause for those 10 years or less from retirement; A gradual increase in the eligibility age for receiving benefits for those farther than 10 years from retirement; Emphasis on stopping and punishing fraud; Reduced federal spending across the board. "When Dr. Brat talks about fairness, he's talking about being fair to existing generations AND to future generations," Gottstein said in an email. "’Grandfathering’ is one way to be fair to our seniors and the nearly-retired. But he also talks about how we have to fairly treat current workers who are contributing to the system by ensuring that the money THEY invest is there for their retirement." Our ruling Trammell says Brat said "the best way to fix Social Security would be to give seniors back what they paid in and no more." Trammell tries a typical scare tactic -- attacking a Republican as threatening to cut seniors’ benefits. But his campaign didn’t provide examples of Brat making that actual claim, and Brat’s support of the idea of grandfathering today’s seniors -- and those retiring within 10 years -- would protect them. Brat opened the door to some speculation about his views by making open-ended statements about reforming Social Security during the GOP primary this spring. But Trammell has gone overboard in interpreting them and putting words in Brat’s mouth. We rate Trammell’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-06840	Says Obama has never submitted a budget, and Congress has worked for two years without passing one.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/05/buddy-roemer/obama-submitted-budgets/	Former Louisiana Congressman and Governor Buddy Roemer has been out of politics for a long time but he still knows how to throw a jab. Perhaps best known for switching parties from Democratic to Republican as governor in 1991, Roemer left politics some 16 years ago to work as a banker. Now, he’s back as a populist GOP presidential candidate who says he's fed up with special interest money. A couple of days before announcing his bid, Roemer squared off on President Barack Obama. "Someday, somehow, somewhere, sometime, the president of the United States and his party have to be responsible for running the country," said Roemer, 67, at a press conference in Bedford, N.H. He continued: "I am embarrassed that two and a half years into his [President Obama's] term in office he's never submitted a budget. You know Congress has worked two years without passing a budget." His pronouncement was startling. No budget? What has the president been doing up there in Oval Office? Asked to back this statement up with facts, the Roemer campaign declined to comment. So we turned to the experts, checking the public record and reaching out to five economists across the political spectrum. Not true, they all say. As per law, Obama has submitted a budget for each fiscal year he’s been president -- fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012, according to a quick check on the Government Printing Office’s website, where the documents are posted. It’s as simple as that. But regarding Roemer’s second claim-- that Congress has worked for two years without adopting a budget -- budget experts say Roemer has a point. Congress last adopted a budget resolution in fiscal year 2010. It neglected to do so in fiscal year 2011 and appears unlikely to agree on a budget framework for the next fiscal year, 2012, which begins Oct. 1, said Steve Ellis, a budget expert with Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. The budget resolution sets spending limits for broad categories of funding and is usually the first step for Congress in adopting a budget. The budget resolutions are important "organization and enforcement documents" to guide Congress through achieving most of what’s in the president’s budget, Ellis said. Without a budget resolution, "it makes it harder to enact spending bills because you don’t know exactly what the bottom line is," Ellis said. "It’s not a good way to govern. It makes it a lot harder to hammer out a deal." After the president’s budget is submitted, House and Senate budget committees are supposed to draft budget resolutions, frameworks intended to guide the spending process, which then go to the floor for approval. Once adopted, the two resolutions go to a House and Senate conference committee, where they are reconciled and sent back to the respective chambers for final approval. But that process hasn't been working. In 2010, the then Democratic-controlled House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution or adopt a single spending bill "because the Democrats were afraid of being labeled big spenders," Ellis said. In April, 2011, without a budget resolution, Congress, with the House controlled by Republicans, agreed to a spending bill for fiscal 2011 in order to avoid a government shutdown. That bill provides funding through the end of September, 2011. The budget resolution provides the blueprint for such legislative activity but it’s not necessary to the process, said Jim Horney, an economist with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "While (Congress) did not agree on a budget resolution … it did of course, pass those appropriations and other budget legislation for fiscal year 2011 and is working on legislation for 2012," Horney wrote in an e-mail. And this year, it appears again unlikely that Congress will adopt a budget resolution. The now GOP-controlled House approved its budget resolution -- commonly referred to as the Paul Ryan Plan after its principal author, the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House budget committee -- which Democrats consider "draconian," Ellis said. The Senate Budget Committee unveiled a framework in early July, 2011, but the Senate has not yet approved any resolution. And it appears the adoption of a budget resolution has been overtaken by events, Ellis said. The debt ceiling plan approved by Congress will establish a discretionary spending cap, which is much of what would be accomplished by a budget resolution. Sen. Kent Conrad, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, acknowledged as much in the conclusion of his budget framework address on the Senate floor on July 11, 2011. Conrad said: "That is the blueprint the Senate Budget Committee Democrats are laying before our colleagues. We are under no illusions. We know this is a year in which the normal process is not being followed. We understand there are leadership negotiations at the highest level, so we understand this is not going to be dealt with in the normal course of doing business." Our Ruling Roemer erred in saying Obama had not submitted a budget. In fact, he’s submitted three. But there is some truth on the second part of his statement. Congress didn't pass either a budget resolution or a spending bill in 2009 and 2010. A last minute spending bill finally passed in April 2011 under the threat of a government shutdown. And, since then, the passage of the debt ceiling increase has made the passage of a budget resolution for the current fiscal year less pressing. Taken in the context of his remarks, Roemer’s assertion implies that Obama and the Democrats have been irresponsible -- and as a result, there has been no budget for the last two years. Obama submitted budgets, but it is true that during 2009 and 2010, when Democrats controlled the Congress, no budget was passed. As a result, we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-10692	"A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the USDA ... But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/10/hillary-clinton/a-legitimate-beef-with-ham-sandwich-regulations/	In a speech in Shenandoah, Iowa, Clinton made a campaign issue out of a ham and cheese sandwich. She said the federal government "is not taking the steps necessary to protect us" because of inadequate inspections of toys and food. She cited this example: "A ham and cheese sandwich on one slice of bread is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which inspects manufacturers daily. But a ham and cheese sandwich on two slices of bread is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration, which inspects manufacturers about once every five years." To find out if her sandwich example was correct, we turned to government reports on food safety, interviewed the head of the USDA's food inspection service and studied the government's Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, a fascinating manual that provides rules for Wiener schnitzel ("a veal cutlet prepared by dipping in egg, flour and bread crumbs, and frying to a golden brown") and vinegar pickle ("sausage in vinegar pickle is approved with the understanding that sausage is completely covered with pickle and that the pickle has a pH level not higher than 4.5"). The manual also spells out which foods are under USDA jurisdiction. We found that Clinton is correct about the regulation of sandwiches and the big disparity in inspections by the two agencies. In an interview with PolitiFact last week, Richard Raymond, the USDA's undersecretary for food safety, acknowledged that the sandwich rule is silly. "There is no rationale or logic that I can explain to anybody," he said. "It defies logic." He said the rules don't affect the safety of the nation's food supply, but said, "it's an issue that makes it look like we don't know what we're doing." Raymond didn't know the origin of the sandwich rule, but others suggested that the volume of meat might have been the key factor in whether it was FDA or USDA jurisdiction. (The rule only applies to plants that assemble sandwiches for retail stores like 7-Elevens. Sandwiches made-to-order at a deli or a Subway store are not subject to the inspections, Raymond said.) To understand the strange bureaucratic turf of food inspections, you have to go back to the 1906 publication of Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle , which described horrific conditions at meat plants. That book, still required reading in many high school English classes, had such impact that it persuaded Congress and President Theodore Roosevelt to enact a law requiring meat inspections. Roosevelt had called for a law that would require oversight "from the hoof to the can." Since then, the government has put considerable emphasis on meat and poultry, which fall under the USDA. The agency's 7,500 inspectors and veterinarians conduct continuous daily inspections of the nation's meat and poultry plants. The law requires USDA inspections before the products can be sold. But other foods have not gotten the same scrutiny. Most are regulated by the FDA, but the law does not mandate inspection frequencies, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. The report confirms that Clinton is correct that, on average, the FDA inspects the 57,000 food plants under its jurisdiction about once every five years. "There is no rhyme or reason to how we regulate food today in the U.S.," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. "It's based on antiquated laws and bifurcated agencies. The current food safety system doesn't protect the public." Without a mandate for regular inspections, the FDA hasn't gotten enough money to do them more frequently. Smith Dewaal said the agency is "really starving for resources." Her complaints are echoed in a new report from an FDA advisory panel. The November 2007 report for the agency's Science Board said the FDA is so overburdened and underfunded that it can't effectively conduct routine surveillance. "The nation's food supply is at risk," the report said. And so we find that Sen. Clinton has a legitimate beef on ham and cheese. We find her claim to be True.

pomt-14432	"Twenty million Americans are out of work."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/09/john-kasich/john-kasich-ad-says-20-million-americans-are-out-w/	For all the discussion of immigration, foreign policy and social issues in the 2016 campaign, one issue always returns to the fore eventually: jobs. Republican candidate John Kasich emphasizes his record on jobs as Ohio governor in a new ad. The ad begins with grainy footage of what seems to be an unemployment line. The narrator’s first words are, "Twenty million Americans are out of work," and this assertion is bolstered by being repeated in on-screen text: This figure sounded high to us, since the official number of unemployed Americans during the most recent month, February, tops out at about 7.8 million. So we asked the Kasich campaign for their evidence, and they proceeded to cite a source that caught us off-guard: Us. Specifically, they pointed to our fact-check from August in which we analyzed a statement by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Trump said that "we have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed." We rated this claim False, largely because the 93 million number included lots of people who would not be expected to want or be able to work, including full-time students, senior citizens, the disabled, and those who have chosen to take care of their children full-time. However, in the process, we conducted a mathematical experiment in which we played with possible numbers of Americans who are "out of work" that fit somewhere between the official unemployment rate (on the low end) and Trump’s number (on the high end). HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Here’s what we wrote, using the statistics that were current at the time: The official number of unemployed Americans is 8.3 million -- less than one-tenth of what Trump says. But to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, it’s possible to expand this number using more credible economic thinking. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it’s not unreasonable to include: • The 6.4 million people who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being "in the labor force," but who say they "currently want a job." • And the 6.5 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job. This would mean that upwards of 21 million Americans could be described with some justification as "out of work" involuntarily, either fully or partially. But that’s not even one-quarter of the number that Trump offered. Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Kasich, said the campaign simply updated our math with more recent data in preparing the television ad. The numbers for January 2016, Nichols said, were: • Unemployed: 7.8 million • People who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being "in the labor force," but who say they "currently want a job": 6.2 million • People working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job: 6 million. That works out to 20 million on the nose. We salute the Kasich campaign’s efforts to fact-check-proof their assertion. Still, we should note that we didn’t intend our calculation to be the final word on how to determine the number of "out of work" Americans. Rather, we were trying to provide a benchmark for showing just how wrong Trump’s number was. We’ll note that our wording was that the 21 million figure had "some justification" — not exactly a clarion call for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to change its longstanding protocol. In subsequent fact-checks, though not the one the Kasich campaign referred to, we have added language that is clearer about our intentions. We did that, for instance, in our Feb. 11, 2016, fact-check of a different statement by Trump: "Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35 (percent). In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent." In that fact-check, which produced a rating of Pants on Fire, we prefaced a similar alternative calculation this way: "We are deliberately stretching the numbers here as an intellectual exercise; we are not saying that 15.6 percent is a more accurate unemployment rate than the official one of 4.9 percent." But enough from us. What do the two economists we checked with for the original fact-check think about Kasich’s use of the 20 million figure? "Given that the image looks like a guy in an unemployment line, I'd say it's a misleading figure," said Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs website Indeed.com. Many people have good reasons for not wanting to work now, she said, and that is something distinct from actually being "out of work." Burtless agreed, saying, "The 5.988 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job are not ‘out of work.’ They are employed, but on a work schedule that does not provide them with the weekly hours they desire." At the same time, Burtless said there is still some value in the number cited in Kasich’s advertisement. "Gov. Kasich has given an upper-bound estimate of the total number of Americans who are unemployed or underemployed," Burtless said. It’s just not the only estimate. Our ruling Kasich’s ad said that "20 million Americans are out of work." The Kasich campaign shrewdly cites a past PolitiFact item as evidence for this larger-than-usual estimate of America’s "out of work" population. But it’s worth noting that the calculation we did was not intended to determine the actual number of out-of-work Americans, but rather to suggest the highest figure with any sort of credibility as a way of seeing how far out of line Trump’s assertion was. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2016-03-09T10:00:00	2016-02-27	['None']
pomt-04395	In 2012, Connie Mack missed 178 votes, "one of the worst voting records" in Congress.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/17/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-connie-mack-missed-lot-votes-year/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson said that his Republican rival U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV has missed 178 votes this year, giving him one of the worst attendance records in Congress. "Speaking of votes, why don’t you explain how you don’t show up to work. Why don’t you explain how this year you have one of the worst voting records. I have missed one vote this year, you have missed 178," Nelson said. Nelson made the claim during a debate at Nova Southeastern University in Davie on Oct. 17. Mack countered back that they had similar records of missed votes if looking at their entire careers, rather than just this year. Missed votes in 2012 Here we will examine recent figures for missed votes by both Mack and Nelson through September 2012. GovTrack.us tracks missed votes for members of Congress using voting information from the official websites of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. It shows that for the first three quarters of this year, Mack has missed 178 votes (65 in the first quarter, 75 in the second quarter and 38 in the third quarter.) Nelson’s one missed vote this year was to confirm the nomination of a federal judge in Illinois, which passed 86-1 on May 14. But looking at sheer votes isn’t an apples to apples comparison because the House takes more votes than the Senate. Career missed votes That’s why we also looked at the percentage of missed votes on GovTrack for Mack’s tenure and Nelson’s Senate tenure (Nelson previously served in the House 1979-1990) -- and the percentage missed this year. From the start of Mack’s tenure in January 2005, he missed 6 percent of roll call votes. During Nelson’s Senate tenure starting in January 2001, he missed 1 percent. The median missed votes for all members was 2.5 percent. We noticed that Mack’s percentage of missed votes started to spike in the last quarter of 2011 around the time he announced he was running for the U.S. Senate. While Nelson faced token primary opposition, Mack faced more serious challengers, forcing him to campaign more in Florida. The New York Times’ Inside Congress tabulates missed votes and shows the top three vote missers in the House for the 112th Congress, which covers the past two years. For that time period, Mack is in 13th place, according to New York Times reporter Derek Willis. That was worst among Florida representatives. If we removed Reps. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.; and Jane Harman, D-Calif., who resigned; and Donald Payne, D-N.J., who died, Mack would be in 10th place, Willis said. In July, Mack campaign spokesman David James said that Mack missed some votes "to make sure Mitt Romney won the Florida presidential primary in January, something Connie's constituents felt very strongly about when it comes to invoking the change we need in Washington." Our ruling Nelson said Mack missed 178 votes this year, making that "one of the worst voting records." Mack did miss 178 votes this year compared to 1 for Nelson. But unlike Nelson, Mack faced serious primary challengers, which meant he had to campaign in Florida more. Also, the House takes more votes than the Senate, so it’s more useful to look at percentages of missed votes. But the numbers are correct. According to the New York Times, Mack’s record places him in 13th for this Congress which started in January 2011 (or 10th if we omit members who resigned or died). That fits the definition of "one of the worst." We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2012-10-17T21:47:14	2012-10-17	['United_States_Congress', 'Connie_Mack_III']
pomt-11095	Says Bill Clinton "spent $3 billion and got nothing. And (North Korea) started making nuclear weapons a day later."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/13/donald-trump/bill-clinton-north-korea-3-billion-nuclear/	Fresh off the first meeting of a sitting U.S. president and North Korean leader, President Donald Trump said his administration would accomplish what others could not with the rogue nuclear state. On June 12, Trump and Kim Jong Un signed an agreement to "work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." When asked whether this was just another empty promise on North Korea’s behalf, Trump said it was not. "Well, you have a different administration. You have a different president. You have a different Secretary of State," Trump said. "You have people that are — you know, it’s very important to them. And we get it done." Trump clarified he wasn’t just talking about Barack Obama. He put forth another example of past failure: former President Bill Clinton. "(Kim) actually mentioned the fact that they proceeded down a path in the past and ultimately as you know nothing got done," Trump said. "In one case, they took billions of dollars during the Clinton regime. ... Took billions of dollars and nothing happened. … And (Clinton) spent $3 billion and got nothing. And he started making nuclear weapons a day later." Did Clinton spend $3 billion on North Korea and accomplish "nothing"? That’s incorrect for several reasons. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. It wasn’t $3 billion Trump’s dollar estimate is overstated. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, reported that between 1995 and 2008, the United States provided North Korea with over $1.3 billion in assistance. CRS reported that "slightly more than 50 percent for food aid and about 40 percent for energy assistance." The funding was distributed from the end of Bill Clinton’s first term to the final year of George W. Bush. $666 million were given during the Clinton administration. The portion for food aid was aimed at patching the chronic malnutrition faced by large portions of the North Korean population, as a result of famine and inequalities perpetuated by the dictatorship. The United States provided energy funds of $549.7 million in two chunks to North Korea, one between 1995 and 2003, another between 2007 and 2009. From the context of his remark, it seems Trump was talking about the first stream under Clinton. That’s the 1994 Agreed Framework, negotiated between the United States and North Korea amid threats from Pyongyang to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In the treaty, North Korea agreed to halt production of plutonium, which is used for nuclear weapons. The country halted plutonium processing in Yongbyon and froze construction of two other reactors. In return, an international consortium would replace North Korea’s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors, mostly financed by Japan and South Korea, to provide the energy without nuclear capability. Meanwhile, the United States agreed to supply heavy fuel oil. The two light-water nuclear reactors were never built. The United States nonetheless provided North Korea $400 million in heavy fuel oil until 2003. The money was distributed by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, the organization established to implement the Agreed Framework. When Clinton was president, the United States provided $236 million. In 2002, U.S. negotiators presented North Korean officials with evidence of a clandestine uranium enrichment program, which North Korean officials initially confirmed, then denied, leading to the breakdown of the Agreed Framework under the Bush administration, according to another CRS report. That’s about eight years later than Trump suggested. Did Clinton "accomplish nothing"? While the agreement ultimately failed with the revelation of North Korea’s uranium enrichment program, experts said it was too far to say that the agreement Clinton struck didn’t do anything. "The Framework Agreement was at best an incomplete agreement, but it worked for the better part of a decade to keep spent reactor fuel in cooling ponds," Jonathan Pollack, nonresident senior fellow in the Center for East Asia Policy at the Brookings Institution. "Not optimal, perhaps, but it kept North Korea’s plutonium based program frozen between 1994 and 2002." Kingston Reif, director of disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, pointed to the key metric of North Korean warheads from Clinton’s defense secretary, William Perry. In Perry’s 2015 book My Journey at the Nuclear Brink, he estimated that North Korea would have enough plutonium for more than 100 nuclear warheads today, as opposed to the estimated 25 in its current arsenal, were it not for the Framework Agreement. Greg Thielmann, former director of the Strategic, Proliferation, and Military Affairs Office of the State Department's Intelligence Bureau, said Clinton’s policies also interrupted North Korea’s flight-testing of longer range ballistic missiles. "Recall that the U.S. intelligence community had predicted in the fall of 1999 that North Korea was likely to test an intercontinental-range ballistic missile before the end of the year," Thielmann said. "But instead, North Korea agreed during the Clinton administration to a missile testing moratorium that lasted until 2006." Our ruling Trump said Clinton "spent $3 billion and got nothing. And (North Korea) started making nuclear weapons a day later." The money that went toward North Korea as part of the Agreed Framework, negotiated by Clinton in 1994, amounted to approximately $400 million. The rest of the $1.3 billion the United States has spent on North Korea mostly went toward food aid. North Korea’s nuclear capabilities were curbed for almost a decade, experts told us, tempering Trump’s claim that the deal accomplished "nothing." There's an element of truth in that money changed hands and North Korea found another way to get nuclear bomb material. But the specifics Trump offered are overblown and incorrect.

pomt-00416	Says U.S. Rep. John Carter "hasn’t held a town hall in five years."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/29/mj-hegar/has-congressman-john-carter-not-held-town-hall-fiv/	Has a Central Texas congressman not hosted a "town hall" meeting for half a decade? Democrat M.J. Hegar of Round Rock says as much about the Republican she’s challenging to represent the state’s 31st Congressional District, eight-term Rep. John Carter of Round Rock. The district, north of Austin, sweeps in Williamson and Bell counties. Hegar, a decorated Air Force veteran, has promoted her candidacy with a video in which she says that she once tried but failed to land a meeting with Carter about lifting the ban on women to participate in ground combat. "We’ll show him tough," Hegar says in the video. "Then we’ll show him the door." Hegar said of Carter in an Aug. 21, 2018 interview on Spectrum News's "Capital Tonight:" "He hasn’t had a town hall in five years and he’s kind of acting as if he wants to retire." Hegar points to news stories We sought Hegar’s factual backup for her claim mindful that Merriam-Webster defines a town hall as "an event at which a public official or political candidate addresses an audience by answering questions posed by individual members." The dictionary makes clear that such a gathering doesn’t have to enable anyone to ask anything. Merriam-Webster follows the definition with this sample sentence: "Town halls have lost some of their spontaneity. The 80 or so undecided voters chosen for Tuesday's event must submit their questions in advance and moderator Candy Crowley of CNN will decide which people to call on." Christian Walker of Hegar’s campaign pointed us to a Texas Observer article describing a 2013 town-hall meeting where Carter faced critical questions. Walker also singled out a February 2017 Austin American-Statesman news story quoting a Round Rock resident, Felicia Miyakawa, saying Carter’s staff had told her and others that Carter hadn’t hosted live town hall meetings since the shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., at a public meeting with constituents in 2011. Carter spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer responded at the time: "I wouldn’t say that is ‘the’ reason, but it would be correct to say it contributes to the many reasons. Mostly town halls are not nearly as effective, and you can’t reach nearly as many people as a tele-town hall." One alternative: Mass conference calls. The American-Statesman story said: "Many members of Congress prefer the safety of tele-town hall meetings, which offer interaction with constituents but in a controlled setting — essentially large-scale conference calls in which hundreds or thousands of people can listen in and queue up to ask a question — with no booing, no signs with clever slogans, no bad headlines, no viral videos." Carter held an hour-long tele-town hall on March 22, 2017, according to an American-Statesman news blog post. More recently, an Aug. 11, 2018, news story in the newspaper said Carter had reached out to residents through Facebook Live events. Carter: ‘Man of the people’ When we asked Carter about Hegar’s claim, he said by phone that he’d held multiple events attended by people asking questions. "I’ve been all over my district now, for 12- to 14-hour days, which is pretty typical of my work in Augusts each year. I would say I’m way ahead of my opponent in the Man-of-the-People category," Carter said. When we inquired into Carter’s formal schedule, we heard back from his office’s Emily Taylor. By email, Taylor listed four August 2018 events where, she said, Carter took questions from constituents on topics including federal pensions, Fort Hood and the legalization of marijuana. The events, Taylor said, were hosted by the Temple Kiwanis Club (Aug. 7); American Legion Post 133 (Aug. 14); the Military Officers Association of America (Aug. 17); and the Killeen Chamber of Commerce (Aug. 23). An Aug. 14, 2018 Temple Daily Telegram news story on the American Legion event includes a section titled "Town Hall" stating that Carter "took a few minutes to discuss congressional business and field questions from the audience." We asked if Carter had held public town halls open to all constituents. Taylor replied that Carter had hosted 25 telephone town halls in five years, the latest one on June 18, 2018. "The last four alone have reached 71,471 constituents," Taylor wrote. Also, Taylor said, Carter holds Facebook Live "town halls, where constituents can tune in online and ask real-time questions or submit questions on our website if they’re unable to tune in during the live event." She pointed us to a nearly 20-minute Facebook Live that Carter held July 2, 2018. Such events are publicized, Taylor wrote, through Carter’s electronic newsletters. Our ruling Hegar said Carter "hasn’t held a town hall in five years." As Hegar maintained, it looks like Carter hasn't hosted a traditional in-person town hall any time recently. Yet he holds tele-town halls, makes Facebook Live appearances and talks at meetings hosted by local groups. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-14037	"Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law."	false	/texas/statements/2016/may/27/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-wrongly-says-texas-among-states-no-equ/	She lost the Texas governor’s race in 2014, where she called for stepped-up attention to women’s health care access and equal pay. But Democrat Wendy Davis still talks up women’s issues including, in a March 2016 interview by Texas Monthly, her desire to revisit legislation nixed by the Republican governor when she was a state senator from Fort Worth. Asked what issues she’s thinking about "besides reproductive autonomy," Davis replied: "Of course, equal pay. You may recall that I, along with the amazing Senfronia Thompson in the Texas House, was successful in passing an equal pay bill here, which was no easy feat—only to have it vetoed by Gov. Perry. So Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law. Even the law that exists at the federal level needs some punch." We wondered about the Texas part of her statement. Does the state rank among a few states lacking a law that ensures equal pay for male and female employees holding comparable jobs? Texas actually has laws that apply, we found, though no law has a time window like the one in federal law for an employee to challenge a pay action. To our inquiry, a Davis spokesman, Hector Nieto, described that gap--closed by laws in 42 states--as substantially weakening a Texas employee’s ability to sue. As a senator, to recap, Davis championed a measure giving a worker affected by an unequal pay action 180 days to file a dispute from when the inequity is discovered. The sought change, in keeping with the federal Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, would have widened a state law that gives workers 180 days from the occurrence of an "unlawful employment practice" to file a complaint. House Bill 950 by Rep. Thompson, D-Houston, won House and Senate approval in 2013, a year after the Texas Supreme Court held that absent legislative action, the Ledbetter provision revising the statute of limitations didn’t apply to cases brought under the Texas anti-discrimination laws. Next, as Davis said, Gov. Rick Perry vetoed the proposal, as he was urged to do by business interests including Macy’s. In his veto proclamation, Perry said the measure duplicated federal law, "which already allows employees who feel they have been discriminated against through compensation to file a claim with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission." Thompson offered a similar proposal during the 2015 legislative session. It was defeated in the House. Davis spokesman notes NCSL research We recognized that Texas has statutory restrictions on pay discrimination after asking Davis about the basis of her declaration that Texas ranks among states that don’t have an "equal pay" law. By email, Nieto directed us to a July 2015 chart summarizing state "equal pay" laws posted by the Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures, which says it strives to improve the "quality and effectiveness" of the nation’s state legislatures. The chart’s Texas entry indicates the state has two laws related to equal pay--one protecting state government workers, the other generally "prohibiting discrimination based on protected class status." In Texas that includes race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, age and disability. The laws are in the state’s labor code, the chart indicates, which contains: --The Texas Equal Work, Equal Pay law, which took effect in 1993, stating: "A woman who performs public service for this state is entitled to be paid the same compensation for her service as is paid to a man who performs the same kind, grade, and quantity of service, and a distinction in compensation may not be made because of sex." --Chapter 21 of the code, "Employment Discrimination," includes a section stating an employer "commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin or age the employer… fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms, conditions or privileges of employment." We wondered if the general law fairly adds up to Texas already barring pay discrimination. To our request for expert analysis, Amy Starnes of the State Bar of Texas directed us to attorneys including C.B. Burns, an El Paso labor and employment lawyer, who by phone agreed the general law in the labor code offers recourse for workers in Texas who wish to pursue equal-pay disputes. By email, Burns elaborated, though, that the law only applies to employers with 15 employees or more and that private and public employers are covered under it; in contrast, the Texas Equal Pay Act applies to state employees only. Burns summed up: "We don't have a statute called the Equal Pay Act like there is in federal law, but we have a discrimination statute that prohibits sex discrimination and equal-pay claims are a form of sex discrimination." Separately, Patrick Maher, a Dallas employment discrimination lawyer, told us it’s a "misstatement" to say there’s no Texas law against pay discrimination, explaining that the Ch. 21 law would offer protections and defenses on top of federal laws. Other states And what of other states? According to NCSL’s breakdown, as of July 2015, two states had no "equal pay" law: Alabama and Mississippi--a conclusion also reached, as of April 2016, by the Department of Labor. Put another way, the NCSL places Texas among 44 states with a degree of an "equal pay" law. Four states only have a general employment discrimination law: North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin, according to the group. A web search led us to another analysis of state equal pay laws; the American Association of University Women lists Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina as lacking equal pay laws as of 2016. The association, which favors strong state equal pay laws, ranked Texas among 13 states with "poor" laws, meaning in part that the laws don’t apply to all workers. Since the group’s ratings were last updated online, Nebraska passed a measure upping the number of employees covered under their law, moving them into the "moderate" category, Amy Becker, AAUW’s political media manager told us by email. She also explained that Texas automatically qualified for the "poor" rating because its general anti-discrimination law applies only to workplaces with 15 or more employees. AAUW’s breakdown lists 19 measures it would like states to have in their equal pay laws and lists Texas as having one: no discrimination/retaliation for involvement in legal proceedings. States with nine or more equal pay protections are considered to have "strong" equal pay laws. Those states, according to AAUW, are California, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota, Tennessee and Vermont. Our ruling Davis said: "Texas is one of only a handful of states that does not have an equal pay law." Texas might not have the strongest laws against pay discrimination. But two anti-discrimination laws exist, one limited to state employees and the other to people working for larger businesses. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-00480	Claims that Democratic candidate for governor Matt Flynn "told one child predator to ‘wait and see,’ when he should have turned him in to authorities."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/10/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-radio-ad-takes-aim-democratic-candid/	In a radio ad attacking Democratic gubernatorial candidate Matt Flynn, the Wisconsin Republican Party claims that Flynn "told one child predator to ‘wait and see,’ when he should have turned him in to authorities." Flynn has taken heavy criticism from Gov. Scott Walker and others for his role representing the Milwaukee Archdiocese in priest sexual abuse cases from 1989 to 2004. Flynn is one of eight Democrats in the Aug. 14 primary who hope to face Walker in November. The former priest and Flynn have given differing accounts of what happened. But this much is clear: Describing the former priest in question as a "child predator" is one step (or several) too far. Let’s take a look. The case A criminal complaint filed against against Marvin Knighton in 2002 claimed the priest had sexually assaulted a 12-year-old boy. Under Wisconsin law, the charge applies to cases in which an adult has sexual contact with a child under 16 without threats, violence, or injury. According to the criminal complaint, "Knighton would frequently talk about his own penis and told (the boy) that one day he, (the boy), would have hair on his genital area and that when this happened, he would be a man and that he would take him out to dinner." The accuser claimed that the contact involved kissing and touching. The priest would call the boy by a feminine name and tell him how beautiful he was, according to the complaint. Before that, the case had played out behind the scenes. It began when the father of the alleged victim contacted Knighton in 1993 and accused him of sexually assaulting his son. Knighton reported the allegations to the archdiocese, saying he wanted to "clear this up." In a 2003 letter to then-Archbishop Timothy Dolan, Knighton wrote that he went to Flynn regarding the allegation that had been made against him. Knighton stated in the letter that "nothing inappropriate ever happened with this young man." Knighton wrote that Flynn "suggested that we simply wait to see if he would file a report with Project Benjamin," an archdiocesan program to help victims of abuse. When the accuser failed to file a report, Knighton’s letter claimed Flynn told him "not to worry about it. He felt that the young man wasn’t going to do anything." Knighton’s letter went on: "I did not feel comfortable with that decision and again requested that as ‘legal counsel’ for the Archdiocese, that we be proactive in such a delicate matter and meet with my accuser. Mr. Flynn told me that it would be too much of a hassle to do anything legally and most likely nothing would happen. How wrong was that?" The archdiocese partially corroborates Knighton’s account on its website, which in a summary of the case says "the attorney advised Knighton that, because no one had filed a complaint, nothing could be done. Knighton continued to exercise ministry." What the candidate says In July 2018, Matt Flynn held a conference call with reporters in hopes of addressing all questions related to the priest abuse scandal. In it, Flynn confirmed that he did meet with Knighton in 1993 while representing the archdiocese as a lawyer for Quarles & Bradley. However, he denied Knighton’s account and said that Knighton was an unreliable source, given that the letter in question was written a decade after the meeting. "What he says there is false," Flynn said. "I insisted (the archdiocese) go to the police on any allegation." Of course, by that definition, Flynn himself would be an unreliable witness, since he, too, is recollecting events from many years prior. The GOP claim The ad characterizes Knighton as a "child predator." According to the state Department of Corrections, a sexual predator (the law uses the term "sexually violent person") is "a person who has been committed in a civil court proceeding under Chapter 980 of the Wisconsin Statutes." For such a commitment to be made, the person has to have been "previously convicted of certain sexually violent offenses" and "diagnosed with a mental disorder that predisposes the person to engage in further acts of sexual violence." Knighton does not meet either criteria. He has never been convicted in a criminal court of sexual assault. In the 2003 criminal case, a jury acquitted Knighton of the single charge of second-degree sexual assault of a child. A second allegation of sexual abuse from a 1974 victim fell outside the criminal statute of limitations and thus was never tried in court. By 2004 a third allegation had surfaced but never translated to legal action. Indeed, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections’ sex offender registry does not list Knighton’s name. That said, the archdiocese conducted a separate investigation of Knighton and in a canonical trial found him guilty of both charges of abuse. The church dismissed him from the priesthood after he lost his appeal in 2011. Colloquially, a "predator," as defined by Merriam Webster, is "a person who has committed a sexually violent offense and especially one who is likely to commit more sexual offenses." If the multiple allegations against Knighton are true, he potentially meets this definition. But in this context, we think the legal definition carries the most weight. Reporting to authorities The GOP also claimed that Flynn "should have turned (Knighton) in to authorities." Should he have? Peter K. Rofes, professor of law at Marquette University, doesn’t think so. But the reasons are complicated. Let’s break it down. First, there is the confidentiality obligation between a lawyer and a client. "With very modest exceptions, lawyers must safeguard confidential information and refrain from revealing all information that relates to representation of a client," said Rofes. A lawyer could only share information on a client with, say, the police, if the client threatened to imminently endanger life or inflict massive monetary harm. Under the law in 1993, Rofes said, a lawyer had no legal obligation to report a non-client who threatened similarly harmful acts. In this case, Flynn’s client was the institution of the archdiocese, not Knighton specifically. Under the "principles of confidentiality" contained within Chapter 20 of Supreme Court rules, "Lawyer Flynn did not have an affirmative legal obligation to go outside the archdiocese, to go outside the organization he was representing, with any information on the priest," said Rofes. In 1993, Flynn’s only legal obligation was to make sure the archdiocese was aware of the allegations against Knighton. Since Knighton reported the allegations to the archdiocese, they were aware. Some might argue Flynn had a moral obligation to report Knighton to authorities. Flynn was not precluded from doing that. Nor was the archdiocese. Neither did, which is the thrust of the GOP point. Our rating The Wisconsin GOP claims that Flynn "told one child predator to ‘wait and see,’ when he should have turned him in to authorities." Knighton and the archdiocese have described events that would support the claim, but their accounts have been disputed by Flynn. That said, Knighton does not legally qualify as as a child predator (or even a sex offender) -- which is central to the claim in the GOP ad. Finally, Flynn had no legal obligation to report a non-client to the authorities, but some might argue he had a moral one. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-05735	Says "we had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-he-cut-13-billion-state-spendi/	By Gov. Chris Christie’s account, he arrived in Trenton and slashed billions of dollars of state spending in two years. In a state capital thriving off freewheeling use of tax dollars, Christie said he immediately closed a $2.2 billion gap left by his predecessor. Then, the governor claims, he wielded his budget ax to eliminate another $10.7 billion. In an interview on "Piers Morgan Tonight" that aired on Feb. 21, the same day the governor delivered his budget speech, Christie described his fiscal prudence to a national audience. "Let's look at what I've done in New Jersey, OK? And that's the best gauge to gauge and to judge a politician. Not what they say in a talk show with you, but what they've done," Christie said. "And in two years, what we’ve done is to protect the most vulnerable here, even when we had to cut 13 billion dollars in state spending over two years." OK, let’s judge the governor by his actions. When Christie took office halfway through the fiscal 2010 budget year, his predecessor’s spending plan had a $2.2 billion shortfall. Christie used several measures to close the gap, including cutting $475 million in local school aid. That’s $2.2 billion of the $13 billion Christie claims he cut. It’s at this point that the governor mixes real money with a theoretical figure. Much of Christie’s claim hinges on a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year. The structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all statutory spending obligations were fully funded. However, the budget supersedes state statute. So, although certain levels of spending on different programs may be required, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise. And that’s largely how Christie handled the structural deficit in his first budget. He skipped a $3.1 billion pension payment and didn’t fully fund the school aid formula or property tax rebate program, among other measures. So, Christie didn’t cut that money. He never spent it. "While $13 billion might represent the total deferrals and non-funding what otherwise would be required programming, the actual cuts in state operations, in state government, were substantially less than $13 billion," said Raphael J. Caprio, a Rutgers University professor who researches local and state budgeting and finance. And the structural deficit didn’t go away. For the fiscal 2012 budget year, OLS projected a structural deficit of about $10.5 billion, nearly the same size as the previous fiscal year. Though Christie uses the structural deficit to his advantage when discussing his first budget, he dismissed the fiscal 2012 calculation as the "old way of budgeting." PolitiFact New Jersey sought a response from the governor’s office last week, and Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak issued a reply, admitting the governor got it wrong but criticizing our methods. "This is just ridiculous. Do you people ever just let something pass as a plain-as-day slip of the tongue, human error? Of course he didn’t cut spending by $13 billion," Drewniak wrote in an e-mail. Drewniak, referring to a list he provided of statements Christie made at town halls and other forums, also said: "My point in sending you all those instances of where he accurately explained the budgets, cutting spending and combined deficits was to illustrate the point that of course he knows what he cut from the budgets, and that he has explained it many times." The governor has cut state spending. The percent change differs depending on the point in time the governor’s first budget is compared with the budget he inherited. Either way, it’s a decrease of less than $3 billion. Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said Christie has tried to make fundamental changes in state spending so the structural deficit doesn’t widen. "He’s lowered actual spending and that’s sort of a new fiscal world for New Jersey," he said. Our ruling The governor said "we had to cut state spending by 13 billion dollars over two years." That’s not true. Christie decreased state spending, but the total doesn’t near $13 billion. Christie’s claim hinges largely on a $10.7 billion structural deficit. He used the measurement from his first year in office to his advantage. But the next year, he dismissed the structural deficit as the "old way of budgeting." We rate the claim False.

pomt-00239	Says Tallahassee "is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/oct/08/andrew-gillum/andrew-gillum-says-crime-dropping-tallahassee/	Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum has pushed back on attacks by Republicans that he oversees a crime-ridden city. Gillum’s opponent in the Florida governor’s race, Ron DeSantis, zeroed in on the crime rate in an interview with CBS4’s Jim DeFede. "This is a guy that is presiding over the highest crime in Florida four years running," DeSantis said Sept. 23. One week later, also on DeFede’s show, Gillum fired back: "I'm the mayor of a city that right now is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate and we accomplished that by having fewer arrests at the same time," he said. We decided to fact-check both candidates who are running for governor. We found that DeSantis and Gillum point to valid statistics, but cherry-pick those that make their point while omitting the broader picture and caveats about crime statistics. "I would say that both DeSantis and Gillum are off the mark a bit in either blaming or crediting the mayor," University of Florida criminology professor emeritus Ronald Akers said. Here, we will fact-check the statement by Gillum that Tallahassee is experiencing a five-year low in its crime rate. Tallahassee’s crime rate Experts generally focus on crime rates per 100,000 residents rather than sheer numbers of crimes. The Tallahassee Police Department, among other law enforcement agencies across the state, report crime data to the state for the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reports program each year. The data includes arrest and crime figures for several types of offenses, including murder, rape, robberies and thefts. We looked at the reports on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s website and compiled the crime rate for each year for the past decade. Gillum was sworn into office as mayor in November 2014 following more than a decade on the city commission. Year Tallahassee crime rate per 100,000 residents 2017 5,764.5 2016 6,726.8 2015 6,211.3 2014 5,833.7 2013 5,178.3 2012 5,553.7 2011 6,041.1 2010 5,801.9 2009 5,669.6 2008 6,115.2 Source: Uniform Crime Reports So when Gillum says that Tallahassee is experiencing a five-year low in the crime rate, he is pointing to the rate of 5,764.5 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2017 and comparing that 2013, when the rate was 5,187.3. Gillum has said the downward trend in crime has continued so far in 2018. In September, city Police Chief Michael DeLeo shared data with the city commission showing that during the first six months of 2018 overall crime was down 10.3 percent and violent crime was down 24 percent. One caveat about crime data: it is only as good as the reporting by the local police agencies. An audit the police chief sought found that the city incorrectly reported crime statistics at a higher rate due to various errors in 2017. DeLeo told PolitiFact a small percentage of the drop between 2016 and 2017 is attributed to the overreporting found in the audit. However, he said that even when comparing the first half of 2016 and 2017 before the reports were audited there was a decrease in crime. Other side of the crime picture Rather than focus on the more favorable trend of reduced crime, the Republicans focus on hard, scary recent numbers. In 2017, the city had 17 murders, the highest ever. In the same year, Leon County’s crime rate was the highest in the state — as it was in 2014, 2015 and 2016. While Leon County is a broader area than just the city of Tallahassee, the Tallahassee Police Department handles the bulk of the county’s crime. Limitations of crime rate data The FBI cautions about the pitfalls of using crime statistics to rank communities. Such rankings ignore local characteristics that influence crime, such as poverty rates and the concentration of the youth population. The American Society of Criminology reached a similar conclusion. Tallahassee is a college town, home to Florida State University and Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, and also the state government. Accordingly, the city has a large number of visitors who do not live year-round in the city, including students, lobbyists, politicians and other people who work at the Capitol but may live in other cities. That means that crimes committed against — or by — students or commuters who work in the capital city are included in the count of Tallahassee’s crimes, but many of them are not counted in the residential population of the city. "This causes the per-person crime rate to be artificially inflated," said Brian Stults, an associate criminology professor at Florida State. A city mayor has relatively little control over the characteristics most often identified as the strongest predictors of local crime rates, such as poverty and the age of residents, Stults said. The mayor may have some control over the size of the police department, but studies are inconsistent about whether increases in police size and funding lead to decreases in crime, Stults said. The more important factor is not how many police you have, but how they police. The police department has increased its emphasis on community and problem-oriented policing over the past several years, which some studies have linked to reductions in crime. A city spokeswoman said Tallahassee has hired a few dozen more police officers during Gillum’s tenure as mayor, growing the force by about 11 percent. Mayors, and police chiefs, can influence the strategies the police department uses, but the results that flow from these strategies take time, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a police officer in Bartow, Fla., in the 1970s. The Tallahassee Democrat has written about various efforts by city and county officials to tackle crime in recent years, including targeting violent crime hotspots, monitoring crime trends, and developing a program for young people who are not in school or work. Experts caution against giving politicians credit or blame for declines or increases in crime, which are more likely a function of social changes in the community or economy than political actions. Our ruling Gillum said, "I'm the mayor of a city that right now is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate." The crime rate in Tallahassee was 5,764.5 per 100,000 people in 2017 — the last time it was lower was in 2013. While Gillum points to the good news about the crime rate drop, Leon County still tops the state in the crime rate. The county includes a broader area than Tallahassee. Experts caution against mayors taking too much credit (or blame) for changes in crime, which is heavily influenced by factors beyond a mayor’s control. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04849	Says the federal government "mandates transexuals (sic) and homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones in the name of airport security."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/13/mark-clayton/disavowed-democratic-senate-primary-winner-claims-/	Mark Clayton, the 32-year-old floor installer and former Army Reserve aircraft technician who recently won the Democratic Party primary as a candidate for the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, has made a lot of colorful, sometimes wacky statements, as he campaigns. We decided to check out one found on his campaign’s Facebook page, in which he claims that the federal government "mandates transexuals (sic) and homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones in the name of airport security." We asked Clayton for some supporting documentation or evidence for this assertion and he responded by sending a Public Advocate of the United States press release. It contains the statement of Eugene Delgaudio, president of Public Advocate, under the headline, "We were right all along: Perverse court allows TSA male agent to grope women." The statement begins: "The TSA’s mix of ultra-leftist hiring practices along with their intrusive ‘security’ procedures of pornographic scanners and groping is leading to disaster." We suggested to Clayton that the assertions by Delgaudio, a Loudoun County, Va., supervisor and fervent anti-gay-rights advocate, did not support his statement factually, but we received no further response. We took note that the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks right-wing extremist groups, has labeled Public Advocate a "hate" group. The Democratic party has disavowed Clayton’s candidacy, has tried to keep him off the ballot and has suggested voters write in an alternative. But we decided to look at the case that Delgaudio made involving a transgender employee named Ashley Yang who worked for the TSA in Los Angeles. Yang dressed as a woman and took hormone therapy to look like a woman. Yang was fired after complaining of discrimination, sued and received five months’ back pay and other compensation in a negotiated settlement. From what we can find from legitimate sources, the Yang case does not involve "transexuals (sic) or homosexuals grabbing children in their stranger-danger zones," nor even transsexuals doing so. It does involve employment law regarding the on-the-job treatment involving gender identity, and a voluntary settlement in which one party was a federal government agency. Bending over backwards to try to make Delgaudio’s statement somehow support Clayton’s claim, we nonetheless note Delgaudio is alleging that Yang was groping women, not children. There is a difference, even if the allegation itself is dubious. Delgaudio also made a statement that "when I see men with wigs and dresses lining up to work as TSA screeners, or little boys crying because a strange man is violating their bodies, I know that I can’t possibly be on the wrong path." Absent reports that such things are happening, that does not pass for evidence. Nonetheless, we sought out a response to the claim from the TSA. Jonathan Allen, a TSA spokesman, responded to our inquiry with the following statement: "While fulfilling a critical and necessary security mission, we are conscious of individual concerns of passengers and strive to conduct the screening process with dignity and respect." Allen also sent along TSA policy statements on Civil Rights, the screening of children and on "pat downs." The policy regarding children reads in part: "Security officers will approach children gently and treat them with respect. If a child becomes uncomfortable or upset, security officers will consult parents about the best way to relieve the child's concern." Our ruling The state Democratic Party’s disavowal of Clayton is but one indication of his lack of credibility. This kind of baseless statement is yet another. The TSA does not mandate that any of its screeners "grope" children in any "zone." Clayton is making a ridiculous, reckless claim, and for that we give this statement a Pants On Fire!

pomt-05064	Says "while state leaders have cut funding for our schools and other basic priorities, the amount of money the state is projected to give away through tax breaks increased by a whopping $3.4 billion."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/06/our-oregon/has-state-left-tax-giveaways-grow-while-cutting-sc/	For several years, Oregon has faced an economic crunch. Schools, social services and public safety have all taken cuts. In a recent newsletter, Our Oregon, a nonprofit backed by public employee unions, highlights those cuts and points to an alternative: Tax breaks. Here’s what the newsletter says: "The reason for this crisis is simple: As a state, we're not funding our schools at even an adequate level. And it's not that we don't have the resources, it's that we're choosing to give away the money through an ever-increasing list of tax breaks and loopholes. Even while state leaders have cut funding for our schools and other basic priorities, the amount of money the state is projected to give away through tax breaks increased by a whopping $3.4 billion." PolitiFact Oregon has looked a lot at budgets. We say this again and again, but technically the state budget as a whole is not shrinking. It’s actually up about $400 million this biennium over last. But that growth isn’t enough to keep up with inflation and other factors. That means, even with budget increases, the state still has to make service cuts. The state’s schools are seeing something similar happen. The State School Fund is up about $160 million this biennium over last and yet teachers are being laid off and class sizes are increasing. We’re also no stranger to the issue of tax breaks. Previously we looked into whether the state spends more on giveaways than it does on education, public safety and health care combined. The answer: Mostly True. Still, we wondered if lawmakers were really growing giveaways by the billions while cutting other programs. We pulled out our copy of the state’s 2011-13 Tax Expenditure Report and on Page 5 we found the numbers we needed. We figured Our Oregon was talking about this biennium compared to last -- by that measure, they were right. In the 2009-11 biennium, the state granted nearly $28 billion in tax breaks. This biennium, the total is expected to hit $31.4 billion. That’s the $3.4 billion -- or 12 percent -- increase Our Oregon mentioned. We confirmed with Our Oregon spokesman Scott Moore that those were the same numbers they looked at. Fact checks, though, are never that easy. We wondered why this increase was happening, especially, as Our Oregon pointed out, during a time when other things are being cut. We called the state’s economist Mark McMullen and asked him if he could explain some of the growth to us. "A lot of these are just going to grow organically or just along with the economy," he said. Some of these are particularly big breaks, too. Say mortgage interest deductions or state income tax deductions. A good chunk also comes from the fact that Oregon is linked to the federal tax code. That is all to say that lawmakers can’t cut these areas as easily as they can other spending. That doesn’t mean they don’t try. During the 2011 session, about 20 tax credits were set to expire and lawmakers opted to renew half of them -- or about $10 million worth. This is part of a recently instituted, six-year cycle in which all credits will get reviewed before being renewed. We asked Moore whether he thought the group’s newsletter might have pointed that out. "The sunsetting of the tax breaks that they embarked on in the last session is a good start," he said. "It's wonderful that they're doing that ... but right now that only applies to tax credits." What’s more, he said, whether the growth happens with or without an explicit vote, the problem remains. "We are automatically giving away money because we're connected to the federal tax code," he said. "Rather than just throwing up their hands and just allowing us to be connected to the federal tax code (they should ask) ‘Does this make sense for the state of Oregon?’" Our Oregon said in a newsletter that the state is projected to give away $3.4 billion more in tax breaks this biennium than the last, even as lawmakers make cuts in education and other programs. Education budgets have definitely seen service cuts -- though the actual state education budget has grown. Our Oregon’s math is right, but we think it’s important context that the increase isn’t all a result of legislators passing new giveaways and that other budgets haven’t shrunk so much as failed to keep up with growth. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Our Oregon	None	None	None	2012-07-06T15:26:11	2012-06-20	['None']
pomt-07383	Drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf and in parts of Alaska will "immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/04/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-easing-access-drilling-would-/	Except for the speculators and some investors, no one is happy with high gasoline prices. And as prices approached and then topped $4 a gallon in late April, an old debate roared with one side wanting to hold the profiteers accountable -- while the other side said it’s high time to tap America’s protected oil fields. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman weighed in by saying that price fixing, if there is any, should be prosecuted, but that it’s also time to harness energy sources "in our own backyard." "As an immediate bridge, we should increase access for oil exploration and production in energy-rich areas of the country like the Outer Continental Shelf, and in parts of Alaska," the Ohio Republican said in his column, which ran on his Senate website as well as on RedState.com. "This will create jobs, drive investment, and immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil." Immediately? Not so fast, say the experts. Pretend that environmentalists dropped all objections to drilling for oil on the Outer Continental Shelf -- that area that lies offshore between states’ jurisdictions and the end of United States oceanic boundaries. Also pretend that the public decided its need for oil trumped what environmentalists see as the sanctity of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR. Since we’re just pretending, everyone join in: Drill, baby, drill. Then wait. See ya around 2021. These things take time. The process would have to start with bidding for government leases -- normally a two- to three-year process -- which could lead to the establishment of exploratory wells just to see what, exactly, lies below. Only then is it time to firm up plans for production while drilling more wells, building offshore platforms, assembling and inserting pipelines and, finally, bringing the oil to refineries. "It’s quite a while before it can go into production, and the lag time is significant," Phyllis Martin, a senior energy analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Agency or EIA, told us. As a general rule, "it could be anywhere from three to 11 years, and three is really fast-track and that’s for shallow offshore" production with little or no need for exploration or lease negotiations. The price differential, too, is misunderstood, she said. That’s because gasoline prices are set on the global market, and as various studies have noted, OPEC and other foreign oil producers could cut back or respond in other ways to keep prices high. "So it’s not going to have a major impact," Martin said. "There’ll be a few pennies, but not major" savings. Besides talking to Martin, we looked at several studies. Among the highlights: The Outer Continental Shelf of Alaska’s Beaufort Sea could produce its first oil in 2019, and the Chukchi Sea area in 2022, according to a February 2011 analysis by Northern Economics for Shell Exploration and Production. Access to the Continental Outer Shelf off the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico "would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030," said a 2009 update of an earlier EIA study. That was two years ago, when EIA said that "leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017." Push that back by two years now. ANWR drilling would take 10 years to actually produce oil, according to an EIA analysis in 2008 requested by the late U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican. That 10-year timeline would be pushed back if there were protracted legal battles or delays in getting government permits, the analysis said. Portman’s claim seemed off base when we first saw it, but that’s only because we had seen something similar to it before. It was voiced by Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, in 2008 when he was running for president and gasoline prices spiked. A number of other GOP officeholders have repeated it in recent weeks, each wanting to lift federal drilling prohibitions more quickly and more extensively than President Barack Obama and Democrats have been willing to do. PolitiFact ruled McCain’s claim False in 2008, noting that while some economists and energy experts agreed that producing more American oil would be good for jobs and, eventually, the trade balance, it would have no immediate effect on gasoline supply or prices. "I have a problem linking the drilling to current gas prices for political reasons," Dr. A.F. Alhaji, an associate professor of economics at Ohio Northern University and an international expert on oil markets, told PolitiFact nearly three years ago. "The reality is there is no correlation between today's prices and what gasoline will be discovered in the outer shelf." Before researching this subject, we asked a Portman spokeswoman, Christine Mangi, about the source of her boss’s claim. Her response in an e-mail: "Sen. Portman was referring to, among other things, the situation in the Gulf. The Obama Administration was not processing deep water permits in the Gulf which contributed to a 13 percent reduction in oil production there. By freeing up our domestic, energy rich resources in a place such as the Gulf, we can immediately reduce our reliance on foreign sources of oil." Yet Portman said nothing about the Gulf of Mexico (which accounts for about 30 percent of U.S. oil production, according to the EIA). His column took a big-picture view of energy needs and did not engage in the dispute about the government’s speed in granting permits since the BP oil spill in the Gulf in 2010. But most of the Gulf drilling is in fact on the Outer Continental Shelf, so we asked Andy Radford, a senior policy advisor at the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry trade group, about it. He said that at a high point before the spill, the Gulf produced about 1.7 million barrels of oil a day. That’s down by 10 percent to 15 percent today, he said. And if we had that oil now? There would be little to no effect on prices because oil trades on a global market. India and developing nations are consuming more. Turmoil in the Middle East plays a role, too. As for the drop in the Gulf of Mexico, "The Saudis can make that up in a few hours," Radford said. "The effect would be more psychological than anything." In fairness, Portman spoke of reducing reliance on foreign oil, not of reducing the price. But he spoke of an "immediate bridge" to harnessing America’s natural resources by increasing oil production and exploration "in energy-rich areas of our country like the Outer Continental Shelf, and in parts of Alaska." This would "immediately reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil," he said. All evidence is that it would not. The current reduction in oil flowing from the Gulf, which Mangi mentioned in defense of her boss’s claim, represents a tiny portion of this country’s oil output, and the reduced flow is not entirely attributable to the post-spill slowdown in issuing drilling permits. In some cases, Gulf fields were simply tapped out, ending their productive life, said Richard Charter, a senior policy advisor for the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. Furthermore, issuance of new permits has picked up, according to records from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. New permits can lead to more exploration, but there is no guarantee that new exploration will lead to a specific amount of oil. As we said already: It takes time. It is noteworthy that the very day Portman’s column came out, the EIA released its annual energy outlook, saying that while U.S. consumption of liquid fuels is expected to keep rising, the import share has been falling and should keep doing so due to increases in production -- including biofuels -- and greater fuel efficiency. That’s not to say it would or would not be worthwhile for the United States to produce even more oil over the long run. Economists and others cite potential economic, defense and trade benefits in the future. But by asserting this would produce an immediate reduction in dependence on foreign oil, Portman’s claim is False.

pomt-12499	"Donald Trump to issue an executive order to ban Facebook across U.S."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/27/blog-posting/fake-news-story-about-trump-banning-facebook-execu/	A fake Internet post said President Donald Trump was going to outlaw Facebook, but a closer look revealed it was a simple April Fool’s Day prank. The headline on an April 2, 2017, post on usanews4u.us declared, "Donald Trump to issue an executive order to ban Facebook across U.S." Likely concerned by the prospect, Facebook users flagged it as potentially being fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to stamp out fake news. The fake post said that Trump was going to take action despite criticism from congressional Republicans, because fake news was still being widely circulated on the site. Facebook users, federal judges and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were all prepared to fight any executive order, but Trump didn’t care. "Inside, we both know what’s been going on. We know the game and we’re gonna play it," Trump is quoted in the story. First and foremost, we know that this is a faker than fake quote, because it’s a line from Rick Astley’s Never Gonna Give You Up. Internet-savvy users should realize instantly they’re being Rick Rolled here. That’s apparently still a thing for some people. But we just gotta tell you how we’re feeling, and gotta make you understand. Even with Trump’s penchant for labeling things as fake news, there has been no report about an executive order banning Facebook. We tried to reach usanews4u.us through their Contact Us form, but didn’t receive a reply. The site is registered to an address in Veles, Macedonia, a hotbed of fake news websites. And while the post was dated April 2, the tags on the story clued readers in that it is actually for April Fool’s Day. It appears it was a news outlet’s attempt at a joke that was repurposed without clear attribution. The story originated on April 1 at Firstpost.com, a website filled largely with what look to be legitimate, India-centric news stories. There also is a "Faking News" section full of intentionally bogus content "to attract your attention." But this post wasn’t categorized there, instead getting the label "World News." The post also had an April Fool’s Day tag, so the story is a prank. Readers who made it to the end of the faux story would have noticed something not in the usanews4u.us post: A link marked as Trump’s and Zuckerberg’s remarks on the issue actually redirects to — you guessed it — Astley’s 1987 hit single.

pomt-00611	Says Gov. Scott Walker’s proposed state budget contained 110 pages of errors -- an unusually high number -- "and millions of dollars’ worth of mistakes" that were corrected with a follow-up document.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/01/chris-taylor/rep-chris-taylor-says-gov-scott-walkers-budget-fil/	As Gov. Scott Walker travels the country in his not-quite-formal-presidential bid, Democrats in Wisconsin complain he’s neglecting the state. That criticism extends to the 2015-’17 state budget, which will soon be up for votes in the Assembly and Senate. Democrats (and a few Republicans) have complained about a variety of matters in the budget, and said the package was poorly prepared. Such complaints were raised in a news release issued the day before work on the budget began in the Joint Finance Committee. The Democrats on the committee complained that lawmakers were given a "last minute error document" that ran 110 pages. "Drafting errors may happen, but I highly doubt that 110 pages and millions of dollars’ worth of mistakes and unintended consequences are anything but the product of an extremely distracted Governor not putting his home state first," state Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) said in a news release issued by the Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee. Is Taylor right? Did Walker’s budget have an unusual number of budget corrections that were cleaned up in the final hours? How the process works Such last-minute correction documents are not new. They even have a formal bureaucratic name -- an "errata report." Like past governors, Walker issued his budget in February of 2015. The document itself runs 1,800 pages, with most of it being highly technical in nature. The errata report is a document that corrects mistakes identified between the time when the budget is announced and when the Legislature begins its work. In April 2013, during the last state budget cycle, the Walker Administration sent lawmakers an errata report fixing about a dozen items and recommending eight amendments. A March 15, 2013 memo corrected 61 more items, all of which appeared to be very technical. In Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, similar memos corrected about 40 items. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s final budget included about 75 corrections in memos issued in March 2009. "When you’re dealing with an 1,800 page bill you’re going to find a mistake or two," said Legislative Fiscal Bureau Director Bob Lang, who has been with the agency since 1971. "I don’t recall a budget where there weren’t technical changes." Department of Administrator spokesman Cullen Werwie said much the same in an email: "Nearly every budget has an errata to make minor and technical changes. This year is no different." Looking at Walker’s budget Compared with recent budgets, the errata report from the Department of Administration for the 2015-’17, dated April 15, 2015, budget made more corrections -- about 110 by our count -- than those in the past several budgets. On April 13, 2015, the Joint Finance Committee received a smaller document with 12 items that needed to be cleaned up. What about the portion of Taylor’s claim that the changes involved millions of dollars? The "millions" figure cited corresponds with the April 13 errata memo, which says the changes will decrease the state’s general fund balance by $2.87 million. Taylor aide Maggie Gau noted that "millions" also applies to a figure that shows up on page 106 of the April 15 memo. Walker wanted to move the worker’s compensation division from the Department of Workforce Development to the Officer of the Commissioner of Insurance. The original budget failed to include funding for the workers comp agency for the period leading up to that transition. That added $15.67 million in expense. Page 52 of the memo said there were another $4.8 million in expense related to "supplies and services" that were not accounted for in the move of the workers compensation division. That’s at least $20 million in cleaned up mistakes. Other corrections included in the errata memo were substantial policy changes. Among the corrections: Walker’s original budget eliminated mention of the Wisconsin Idea as the foundation of the University of Wisconsin System. (Walker claimed at the time that it was a mistake, but records showed the budget drafting staff following directions issued by Walker’s team.) The memo restored the Wisconsin Idea language. The memo also created a new policy, and proposed capping UW System undergraduate tuition increases at no more than the annual increase in the consumer price index. Our rating Taylor said that Walker’s proposed budget "contained 110 pages and millions of dollars’ worth of mistakes" that were corrected with a follow-up document. Taylor is right on the number of the tweaks made in the budget and that they affected millions of dollars in the state budget. But such clean-up memos are a routine part of the budget process -- though there were a bit more this time than in the three previous state budgets. We rate Taylor’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-12715	"Most U.S. foreign assistance ... is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants."	true	/global-news/statements/2017/mar/08/raj-shah/yes-most-us-foreign-aid-flows-through-us-organizat/	President Donald Trump’s budget director Mike Mulvaney confirmed recently that foreign aid is on the chopping block. In an interview before the president’s address to Congress, Mulvaney said Trump would help pay for an increase in defense spending with "fairly dramatic reductions in foreign aid." Critics of programs that aim to boost economies, increase education and otherwise give poorer nations a leg up often say such aid is wasted through corruption and poor design. While Trump himself indicated during the campaign that some aid was warranted, in 2013 he tweeted, "Every penny of the $7 billion going to Africa as per Obama will be stolen - corruption is rampant!" The former head of the U.S. Agency for International Development Raj Shah wrote recently that such concerns about fraud and theft are way behind the times. "Aid and development practitioners know how to set smart targets, engage private-sector partners, adapt to changing circumstances and make sure taxpayers get the most value for their investments," Shah wrote in a Feb. 24 Washington Post op-ed. "Most U.S. foreign assistance no longer even goes to foreign governments. It is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants; these organizations then implement projects in other countries, employing a combination of American and foreign staff members and often partnering with institutions of civil society." We wondered if, in fact, most American aid goes to private companies and nonprofits, which then run programs in foreign countries. According to the Congressional Research Service, Shah is correct by a whopping margin. The nonpartisan research arm of Congress reported in 2015 that only 4 percent of USAID assistance goes directly to foreign governments. "Most USAID funds go through U.S. partners — universities, NGOs, and contractors — although their efforts may directly assist a government’s ministries of education or health, for example, in providing educational and health programs to their public," the report said. The report said that, collectively, 49 percent of aid flows through American nonprofits, for-profit companies and American educational institutions. Another 29 percent goes to international organizations such as the Global Fund and various United Nations agencies. The domestic share is likely even higher. Shah is a fellow at the aid advocacy group Results for America. Staff there cited a specialty trade publication article that found that in 2015, the top 20 recipients of USAID funding were American organizations and "these transactions account for 70 percent of the total USAID spending for obligated contracts for the year." Not all assistance flows through USAID, but it accounts for over 60 percent of the total. This pattern began to take shape in the mid 1970s as Washington shifted from financing large infrastructure projects to programs more directly aimed at helping the poor. Technical assistance replaced bricks and mortar. There has been a growing emphasis on health, most significantly the President’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). According to a 2013 report on all PEPFAR funding streams, as of 2008, 22 of the top 25 contractors were based in the United States. In 2016, the United States spent about $3.4 billion on health-related programs and about $2.9 billion on humanitarian assistance, according to the government’s website on foreign aid. Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, told us the general pattern of working through the private sector holds across all of the agencies that oversee the aid budget, including the State and Agriculture Departments. "The checks and controls in the procurement system are quite sound," Morris said. "There is this culture of measurement and transparency that is more common today. Our foreign assistance programs are much more steeped in trying to measure what are we getting for our money. We’ve gone beyond protecting against corruption." Our ruling Former USAID administrator Shah said that most U.S. foreign assistance goes to private companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants. According to the Congressional Budget Office, USAID, the government’s largest agency for non-military aid, spends about 4 percent of its funds on direct aid to foreign governments. A trade publication reported that 70 percent of the agency’s money ran through U.S.-based organizations. The use of contracts and grants has grown over the past three decades. An independent aid analyst said the general pattern at USAID applies across the other government offices that oversee foreign assistance. We rate this claim True.

pomt-01681	Says Charlie "Crist made it easier for Duke to take your money."	false	/florida/statements/2014/aug/15/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-charlie-crist-made-it-easier-duke/	Failed nuclear projects by utility provider Duke Energy have suddenly electrified both sides of this year’s gubernatorial campaign. After environmentalist PAC NextGen Climate ran an ad accusing Gov. Rick Scott of not doing anything to stop the North Carolina company from fleecing consumers, the Republican Party of Florida responded with its own commercial pointing fingers at former Gov. Charlie Crist. "Crist made it easier for Duke to take your money," the narrator of the Aug. 12, 2014, ad says. "Crist signed a law helping Duke get billions, while Rick Scott put a stop to the Crist giveaway." PolitiFact Florida already reviewed whether Scott allowed Duke to take ratepayers’ money; we found the claim Half True largely because Scott didn’t say much of anything about the issue. But did Crist have anything to do with the company taking money for doomed nuclear power plant plans? We’ll check this bill line by line. Power play The accusation is based on the twists and turns surrounding the Crystal River nuclear plant and a planned nuclear plant in Levy County that was never built. Duke Energy (which merged with Progress Energy in 2012) had botched required repairs to the existing Crystal River facility and never moved the Levy project out of the planning stage. Thanks to SB 888, which the Legislature passed overwhelmingly in 2006, both companies had been able to charge the state’s 1.7 million Duke customers an "advance fee" to pay for those plants. That bill was signed by Gov. Jeb Bush, though. (Crist was elected in 2006 but didn't take office until 2007.) After it became apparent neither project was going anywhere even while costing Floridians millions, the state amended the law in 2012 with SB 1472, which put a 10-year time limit on the utility companies to start their projects. The state GOP said that’s how Scott stopped "the Crist giveaway," but the measure actually doesn’t affect past collections. Duke decided in 2013 to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fix it. The total cost of the Crystal River project grew to about $1.7 billion from repair work and other expenses. The company also canceled the Levy County project after spending $1.5 billion on it. And yet Duke continued to clamor for more advance fee cash. The Florida Public Service Commission decided in October 2013 to settle with Duke Energy for the two doomed projects. Customers would shoulder $3.2 billion in expenses, insurance would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest. Customers will have to pay monthly charges of $3.45 per 1,000 kilowatt hours for Levy through the early part of 2016 and $2.17 for Crystal River through at least 2017 -- all for two projects that never produced any electricity in exchange for the money paid. The RPOF claim The state GOP told PolitiFact Florida the response ad’s claim was based on then-Gov. Crist signing HB 7135, a 2008 amendment to the original law allowing the advance fee. The portion of the law to which the Republican Party pointed, Section 366.93, was amended to allow the advance fee to be applied to transmission lines to move electricity from power plants to consumers. But as mentioned, Bush signed the original bill, not Crist. Furthermore, Duke Energy didn’t benefit from what Crist approved. "The problem with that argument is that, to the best of our knowledge, Duke never recovered any money related to transmission lines," said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit advocate for sustainable energy policy. "Even though Gov. Crist signed the omnibus energy bill, the provision Scott refers to never played a role in the costs now being borne by Duke Energy customers." Glickman added that one utility company will probably benefit from the inclusion of transmission line planning in the 2008 amendment: Juno Beach-based Florida Power & Light Co., which has 4.4 million customers in the state. Scott and his Cabinet in May approved FPL plans to erect 88 miles of transmission lines for two new reactors in Miami-Dade, despite vocal protests from residents and local officials. The planned lines would include poles that could reach up to 15 stories high and be about 5 feet wide, according to CBS Miami. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said, "Crist made it easier for Duke to take your money." The accusation is about a 2008 amendment to a law that allowed electric providers to charge an advance fee to customers to build or upgrade facilities. The change Crist signed added the planning of transmission lines to the list of approved uses to the fee. There are two big problems with the attack: Jeb Bush signed the original 2006 law, not Crist; and it doesn’t appear Duke Energy ever collected advance fee money to plan transmission lines from its two nuclear projects. Crystal River was an existing plant that didn’t need more, and the Levy County project never made it far enough to consider power lines. If anything, Scott is the one who has allowed a utility company to potentially profit off the change Crist allowed. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05392	"If you put the $47 billion in revenue (raised over 10 years by the Buffett rule) into infrastructure you could create 611,000 infrastructure jobs."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/06/sheldon-whitehouse/sheldon-whitehouse-said-47-billion-raised-over-10-/	The Buffett Rule, a proposal to force millionaires to pay federal taxes at a rate of least 30 percent, has turned into a hot-button issue, even if it stands little chance of passage. Formally known as the "Paying A Fair Share Act of 2012," it failed a test vote in the U.S. Senate on April 16 after Republicans blocked it. When its chief sponsor, Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, spoke on the Senate floor about the projected $47 billion it would raise over 10 years, he suggested that the money could be used to rebuild roads and bridges and, in the process, underwrite jobs -- lots of jobs. "The Senate Republican leader has described the bill as yet another proposal from the White House that won't create a single job or lower the price at the pump by a penny," Whitehouse said. "Well, the minority leader is absolutely right that the aim of this bill is not to lower the unemployment rate or the price of gasoline. However, if you put the $47 billion in revenue into infrastructure you could create 611,000 infrastructure jobs, and a lot of good infrastructure as well." Earlier in the speech he made the same point: "We could use the $47 billion on badly needed infrastructure projects and create 611,000 jobs nationwide." That's 13,000 jobs for every billion spent, or $76,923 per job. One of our readers pointed out that if you spread that over the 10 years that Whitehouse was talking about, that's only $7,692 per year, or a measly $148 per week, about half the federal poverty level. And that wouldn't include paying the costs of the building materials needed for an infrastructure project. When we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson directed us to two documents. It turns out -- based on the first document, a May 2009 report by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) -- that the 13,000 "jobs" aren't jobs. Those are job-years. That's one job lasting one year, a distinction Whitehouse didn't make clear anywhere in his speech. In that study, the CEA forecasts that spending $1 billion would create 10,870 jobs for one year at a cost of $92,000 for each of those one-year jobs. (We'll leave it up to others to decide whether that's a reasonable price to create a single job.) The second document, a notice in the Federal Register from the U.S. Department of Transportation, says in a footnote that the CEA had revised its estimate, concluding that each billion spent on transportation infrastructure would create 13,000 one-year jobs. So if $4.7 billion were raised per year by enactment of the Buffett Rule, that would be, on average, 61,100 jobs for that year. If those people continued to work on those infrastructure projects over the 10-year period, that would still be only 61,100 new jobs, not 611,000. How reliable are these estimates? PolitiFact Ohio looked at this issue on Oct. 26, 2011, when U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette claimed that $1 billion in infrastructure investment translates to 42,000 jobs. That statement was ruled Half True because the estimates were all over the map. LaTourette was citing an old number, used by both Republicans and Democrats, from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration. The newer estimate was 27,800 jobs for every billion spent. Before the recession, a University of Massachusetts study said a billion dollars in infrastructure spending created 18,000 jobs. We put out calls and e-mails to a lot of people asking about the reliability of these numbers, including the Council of Economic Advisers (via the White House), a former member of the council who worked there during the Bush administration, the Cato Institute and several universities. We only received two responses. "This is guesswork at best," and different economists will find such analyses more plausible than others, said Laurence Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University who served as a senior economist on the CEA during the Reagan era. (He is also running for U.S. president as part of the Americans Elect campaign to nominate a candidate via the Internet.) Arthur Mead, an economist at the University of Rhode Island, said, "You're always going to get a difference of opinion" on how many jobs will be generated if the government cycles money through the economy, known as the multiplier effect. "Depending on how much labor is involved, the size of the multiplier will be different." And while liberal Democrat-leaning economists are more tempted to believe such investments will be a big boost to the economy because there are lots of people looking for work, conservative Republican-leaning economists might think the benefits will be less, fearing it will drive up wages and interest rates. "Each side has an element of truth to it," Mead said. "There's always going to be a difference in terms of how they look at it." Said Larson, the Whitehouse spokesman: "As noted by the FHWA [Federal Highway Administration], these projections change over time. That's why we chose to use the most recent -- and the more conservative -- formula available, which is also the one used by the Obama administration." Our ruling U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said $47 billion raised by the Buffett Rule could finance 611,000 jobs for people rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. But that's not really 611,000 jobs. It's job-years. It's the equivalent of 61,100 people employed full-time for just one year. To get to 611,000, you'd have to fire those 61,000 at the end of the year and then rehire another 61,000, and do that for a total of 10 years. Because he didn't give it a clearer context, the 611,000 is misleading. When we think of a job, it's not working for just one year. Also missing is the fact that these types of estimates -- even from reputable groups cited by both parties -- can vary widely. To his credit, Whitehouse was citing an estimate that translates into fewer jobs than what other sources say. But the certainty of his statement is undercut by the mushiness of the underlying economic projections. Ultimately, if everyone hired with this money stayed on the job for 10 years, Whitehouse would be off by a whopping 549,900 jobs. For that reason, we rate his statement False.

pomt-04950	Taxes on groceries and medicine will rise under a plan to improve roads and rail for metro Atlanta.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/27/vincent-fort/transportatioplan-tax-foe-says-plan-hikes-prices-f/	Opponents of a 1 percent sales tax to overhaul the region’s roads and rail are saying the plan will make it harder for metro Atlantans to buy the things they need the most. It’s downright unfair, said state Sen. Vincent Fort, a Democrat who represents a district that stretches from East Point through parts of Atlanta. The proposal goes before voters on Tuesday. "We shouldn't be putting a sales tax on people's food and medicine," Fort said in a television news story that aired on CBS Atlanta (WGCL-TV) on July 21. Your PolitiFact Georgia reporters have vetted nearly two dozen claims about the upcoming penny-per-dollar tax, which would raise an estimated $8.5 billion (after inflation) for transportation projects over the next 10 years. But we hadn’t heard Fort’s claim. Will the transportation tax really increase taxes on food and medicine? "It’s not in dispute," Fort told PolitiFact Georgia. Fort said his statement referred to groceries and over-the-counter medicine, and that he was uncertain whether prescription drugs would be taxed under the plan. Later, he called us back to say that a legislative staffer informed him that prescription drugs were exempt. We reviewed state law and consulted with a spokesman for the Georgia Department of Revenue to check Fort’s account. The tax referendum was born out of Georgia’s Transportation Investment Act of 2010, otherwise known as House Bill 277. The bill divided the state into 12 regions so that voters could decide whether to add a 1 percent sales tax to pay for local transportation system upgrades. These regional taxes would have to meet certain criteria, the bill said. One is that the tax would apply to the sale of food and beverages. The sale of "food and food ingredients to an individual consumer for off-premises human consumption" is exempted from the state’s sales tax, but local governments may tax it. Another criteria is that other existing sales tax exemptions would apply. Under current state law, prescription drugs are exempt. The transportation plan would therefore impose a regional tax on groceries such as a loaf of bread or bananas. It also would tax over-the-counter medications such as the aspirin you took for the headache you got from listening to the transportation debate rhetoric. But prescription drugs would remain tax-free. While the bill specifies that groceries will be taxed, it makes sure other items are not. Jet fuel is exempt, as is fuel used for off-road, heavy-duty equipment or locomotives. So are motor fuel and energy used during manufacturing. Fort’s claim holds up well. "Food and medicine" would be taxed under the new plan, just not prescription drugs. Fort got the important stuff right, but he could have been a little more precise and said "non-prescription medicine." Still, he earns a Mostly True.

pomt-08341	Says Republican candidates in key Wisconsin Assembly races "side with those who want to privatize Social Security -- and risk our retirements on Wall Street."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/28/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/group-says-wisconsin-republican-assembly-candidate/	Worried about the future of Social Security? A liberal Wisconsin group is betting you are -- or that it can make you worried before election day. The Greater Wisconsin Committee and its Greater Wisconsin Political Fund are using mailers and radio ads to target Republican candidates in key 2010 races for the Wisconsin Assembly. Democrats outnumber Republicans there, 52 to 46, with one independent. The central theme of the attacks: The GOP Assembly candidates, like their Washington counterparts, want to privatize Social Security. Yes, Social Security, that venerable federal program -- one the state Assembly has no control over. The wording of the attacks varies, but the claims are all similar to this one against Republican Travis Tranel, who is challenging Rep. Phil Garthwaite, D-Dickeyville. "Travis Tranel," a mail piece says, "sides with those who want to privatize Social Security -- and risk our retirements on Wall Street." Lest anyone miss the point, the flier includes a man -- presumably a fat-cat Wall Street banker or investor -- lighting his cigar with a Social Security card that’s been set aflame. There’s also an image of a magnifying glass inviting readers to "check the facts." Why, thank you. We will. Asked to elaborate on her organization’s claims, Greater Wisconsin Committee executive director Michelle McGrorty offered two main points: In the group’s view, "A Roadmap for America’s Future" -- U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan to tackle the federal debt and deficits, and make significant changes to taxes, Medicare and Social Security -- would privatize Social Security. Ryan, a Janesville Republican, has ties to the state GOP Assembly candidates targeted by the group. At PolitiFact Wisconsin, this is familiar ground. We gave Pants on Fire ratings to claims that GOP congressional candidates backed privatizing Social Security, when Democrats provided no proof beyond a sliced-and-diced statement and a two-word answer taken out of context. Now state Assembly candidates? This could get good. Let’s start with Ryan’s "Roadmap," a plan that has helped put Ryan on the political map, but one that does not have universal support among the GOP leadership in Washington. PolitiFact National examined the roadmap in August 2010, after President Barack Obama alluded to it in saying GOP leaders are backing privatization plans that would tie Social Security benefits "to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market." If adopted, Ryan’s plan would enable workers under 55 to, voluntarily, invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in funds managed by the government. As Politifact National noted: "That's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security." So, the Greater Wisconsin Committee is starting off on the wrong road with its claim about the roadmap. As for the ties to Ryan, this is old-fashioned guilt by association ... and there ain’t much association, at least when it comes to the Social Security issue. Tranel, a Cuba City dairy farmer, is making his second attempt to unseat Garthwaite, a second-term Assembly Democrat. The mail piece that claims he "sides with those who want to privatize Social Security" says its proof is a newspaper article. In the article, Tranel expresses admiration for Ryan -- but there’s no mention of Social Security. Dennis Clinard, a retired U.S. Army master sergeant from Cataract, is seeking to unseat first-term Rep. Mark Radcliffe, D-Black River Falls. A flier says "Washington politicians who wants (sic) to privatize Social Security are the fund-raising muscle behind" Clinard’s campaign. The proof listed in the flier is Ryan’s appearance at a fundraiser for Clinard. It took in $7,250, according to a state GOP official, or about 15 percent of the $46,357 Clinard’s campaign has raised in 2010. Howard Marklein, a Wilson Creek accountant, is running for an open seat against Mineral Point Democrat John Simonson, a retired University of Wisconsin-Platteville economics professor. A mail piece says Marklein is "backed by Washington, D.C., politicians who want to privatize Social Security." McGrorty said the proof is a picture of Ryan and Marklein on Marklein’s campaign website. We could go on. A GWC radio ad says some tea party candidates want to eliminate Social Security and "we have one right here, this guy Jack Cummings." Cummings, an Endeavor farmer, is challenging first-term Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo. McGrorty’s defense: The ad talks about a number of issues and doesn’t say that Cummings wants to eliminate Social Security. Hmmm .... "We have one right here." (Assembly Democrat Ted Zigmunt of Francis Creek also uses a flier to accuse his Republican opponent, Andre Jacque, of supporting privatization of Social Security. A campaign aide cited Jacque’s endorsement by the Republican Liberty Caucus, but no statement Jacque has made about Social Security.) How do the targeted candidates respond to all of this? Brian Pleva, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Republican Assembly Campaign Committee, said none of them supports -- or has made statements in support of -- privatizing or eliminating Social Security. Why would they? They’re not running for Congress. In any case, we could not find any such statements. And the Greater Wisconsin Committee could not provide any. Indeed, on two of the fliers, one of the check-our-facts citations is a report by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. The report predicts cuts in Social Security benefits would result from Ryan’s plan, but that doesn’t address the question of privatization, and the report doesn’t mention the targeted candidates. If you’re sensing a theme here, so are we. In targeting Republicans in races that could shift the balance of power in the state Assembly, the Greater Wisconsin Committee is taking a page from the national Democratic playbook -- and misusing it. To play to fears of seniors and others, the group labels a proposal from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, as privatizing Social Security. Even if the plan did privatize Social Security (in our view it does not), the group has offered no evidence that the GOP Assembly candidates back it. The "proof" cited borders on absurd: One candidate praised Ryan, one got his picture taken with him and a third had Ryan appear at his campaign fundraiser. Is that cigar still burning? If not, we need a light, because the ruling is Pants on Fire.	None	Greater Wisconsin Committee	None	None	None	2010-10-28T09:00:00	2010-10-27	['None']
pomt-06712	"H.B. 194, the Voter Suppression Bill, invalidates a vote where a voter properly marks the ballot in support of a particular candidate, but also writes in the name of that same candidate."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/02/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-state-approved-voter-legisla/	A sweeping election reform bill the GOP-controlled Ohio legislature recently passed has stirred widespread opposition. Democrats have even called it the Voter Suppression Bill. In that spirit, opponents have initiated an effort to repeal the law, House Bill 194, through a voter referendum. U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Democrat from Warrensville Heights, sent an email to her supporters on Aug. 22 asking for help collecting the 231,147 valid signatures of registered voters required to put the law on the ballot in November 2012. The signatures must be submitted by Sept. 29 or the law will take effect. In her email, Fudge laid out several changes the bill makes that she opposes. "HB 194, the Voter Suppression Bill, invalidates a vote where a voter properly marks the ballot in support of a particular candidate, but also writes in the name of that same candidate," Fudge wrote. Invalidating a vote, especially when the voter’s intent is clear, definitely is an issue worth examining. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Fudge’s claim as she pushes for the law’s repeal. The section of HB 194 dealing with a redundant write-in vote represents only a small portion of the massive bill. It is clear, however, this piece of the law is not as clear-cut as Fudge conveyed in her email. The bill defines a ballot as "contrary to law" – such ballots are tossed and not counted – "if the voter marks the ballot for a candidate and also writes in the name of the candidate as a write-in vote," according the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission’s analysis of the bill. However, the bill lays out a scenario in which such a ballot would be counted. Three conditions must be satisfied. First, the ballots must be centrally counted (we’ll explain this shortly). Next, the write-in name on the ballot must be the same as the candidate marked on the ballot. Finally, at least three of four board of elections members must agree that the name on the ballot is "identical" to the name the voter wrote in. Daniel Tokaji, an election law expert at Ohio State University’s Moritz College of Law, gave us a quick explanation of the first requirement. He said the reference to centrally counted ballots is another way of referring to absentee ballots. The law singles out absentee ballots because voting machines at the polls are supposed to notify voters if their ballot has a redundant write-in vote. But some voting machines allow voters to override the notification and submit the ballot with the extra write-in. Those ballots will not be counted, said Matt McClellan, a spokesman at the Ohio secretary of state’s office. Now to the stickier part. The elections board in each of Ohio’s 88 counties has four members – two Democrats and two Republicans. If an absentee ballot contains an extra write-in, the bill says three of the four board members must agree that the write-in is "identical" to the candidate’s name on the ballot. That means the ballot would not be counted if the board deadlocks. "We can easily imagine this leading to shenanigans," said Tokaji, who has been outspoken in his opposition to HB 194. Tokaji described a potential situation in which the voter’s intent was clear, but two board members of the same political party refused to agree the write-in vote is identical to the candidate’s name on the ballot. "Under these circumstances, the ballot would not be counted," Tokaji wrote in an email. The Ohio Democratic Party, which responded for Fudge because the party sent out the email on her behalf, raised similar concerns about the write-in provision of HB 194. Seth Bringman, a spokesman for the party, wondered if an elections board would consider a write-in identical to the ballot if the voter wrote "Marsha Fudge" and the ballot listed her name as "Marcia L. Fudge." "While there are some circumstances in which a vote would count if a voter selected a candidate and also wrote in the name of that same candidate, such a case is the exception under the bill, not the norm," Bringman wrote in an email. Tokaji reached a similar conclusion. "The bottom line is that in some, but not all, circumstances, a ballot which has both a mark and the name of the candidate written in should be counted. Which is, of course, not to say that it will in fact be counted," Tokaji wrote in an email. That some ballots could be counted, though, is a point of clarification for Fudge’s statement. On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but needs clarification rates Mostly True.	None	Marcia Fudge	None	None	None	2011-09-02T06:00:00	2011-08-22	['None']
pomt-10736	"My husband has not withheld a single document."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/10/hillary-clinton/why-withhold-when-you-can-delay/	When Hillary Clinton says her husband isn't withholding any documents, she's technically correct. But she doesn't mean "withholding" in the layman's sense of "to refrain from giving." In fact, former President Clinton is exercising his right to review his White House records before they are made public, and that has delayed the release of thousands of pages of records. In the world of presidential records, "withhold" has a specific meaning. It means a former president raises an objection to a document's release and blocks it from being made public. So far, President Clinton hasn't done that. Here's how it works: When a president leaves office, the records of his administration go to the National Archives. After five years, the records are generally subject to public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Professional archivists determine which records should be publicly available, and the current and former presidents are able to review them as well. The former president is given another seven years — in Bill Clinton's case, until 2012 — to review records and claim exemptions. Under the provisions of FOIA and the Presidential Records Act of 1978, the exemptions include matters of national security and national defense; invasions of personal privacy such as personnel or medical records; federal appointments; proprietary commercial or financial information; and confidential communications between the president and his advisers. To withhold a document, Bill Clinton would have to assert that a document falls under one of those protected categories. However, the former president can take as long as he wishes to review the records, and there's nothing to stop him or his designee from being especially slow about reviewing documents he'd rather not see made public. Even if you don't presume such cynical motives, it's true that President Clinton could be making documents available more quickly by speeding up his own review. We're withholding a True despite Clinton's technical accuracy because most people who hear her statement will take it to mean the former president isn't holding documents back that could be released, and that's not the whole story. We rate it Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-11-10T00:00:00	2007-11-04	['None']
pomt-05119	Says, "Yet in Salem they have traditionally waited until the money is almost gone to pay for the most important things in our state’s budget."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/26/shawn-lindsay/does-salem-traditionally-wait-until-money-almost-g/	Education is pretty much always in vogue in Salem, with politicians clamoring they are for it, not against it. For example, Rep. Shawn Lindsay, R-Hillsboro, issued a press release last week, highlighting support from local school board members. He strongly believes that the K-12 budget should be approved early in the legislative session, say March or April, so that districts can start making plans. "Families across Oregon set priorities and pay for the most important things out of their bank accounts first, not last," noted Lindsay (in the release). "Yet in Salem they have traditionally waited until the money is almost gone to pay for the most important things in our state’s budget." That didn’t sound right. Lawmakers, as far as we know, do not parcel out money on a vote-as-they-go process. Instead, chief budget negotiators on the Joint Ways and Means Committee have a rough idea of how much they can spend for the next two years, and they start piecing the puzzle, knowing they have a minimum for some programs. In an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, Lindsay said the Legislature has a history of approving budgets for lesser needs -- natural resources, employment department, housing -- before passing a K-12 schools budget. He thinks the process should be reversed. "The education budget is held until late in the session after less important budgets have been pushed out early. Those less important budgets are pushed out early so there’s less money in the coffers," he said. Again, that continues to sound inaccurate. We turned to Ken Rocco, Oregon’s legislative fiscal officer. He’s the person who works with legislative budget co-chairs to piece together a spending plan for Oregon, a job he’s done for a long time. The 2011-13 general fund and lottery budget, for some perspective, is nearly $15 billion with $5.7 billion for K-12 schools. Rocco confirmed what PolitiFact Oregon suspected. Lawmakers know roughly what they have to spend. If they agree to a budget figure for K-12, that needs to fit within an overall budget that contains enough money to keep prisons open, provide social and health services, and pay for the state patrol. In other words, no individual budget exists in a vacuum. "You need to have an overall plan," Rocco said. "You can pass the K-12 budget first, but you still need to know what that leaves for the rest of state government." Schools have been receiving a shrinking share of general fund and lottery money, as other needs have grown. There’s no question there’s politics in budgeting, as legislators fight over issues such as compensation, regulations and standards. And there have been legislative sessions when K-12 was among, if not, the last budget to pass -- but not because that was all the money that was left over in the end. We leave you with one final thought before our ruling. In 2011, lawmakers approved a schools budget early in the session, allowing the governor to sign it in April. But Lindsay did not vote for it. He said that while the early approval gave certainty to school districts, the amount was inadequate in his opinion. Do legislators in Salem traditionally wait "until the money is almost gone" to pay for important programs, such as schools? They do not. Lindsay paints an inaccurate picture of the budgeting process. We rate the statement False.	None	Shawn Lindsay	None	None	None	2012-06-26T17:00:30	2012-06-21	['None']
pomt-10041	If we got solar energy from "an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side, that would be enough, in and of itself, to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/18/al-gore/al-gore-optimistic-about-solar-energy-and-pretty-a/	Al Gore startled a Senate committee with an optimistic scheme for harnessing the sun's energy. The former vice president sketched out the idea at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on climate change where he was the star witness. "A technology called 'concentrating solar thermal' is now becoming very competitive," Gore said at the Jan. 28, 2009, hearing. " Scientific American pointed out that if we took an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side, that would be enough, in and of itself, to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year." In January 2008, Scientific American published an influential article titled "A Solar Grand Plan." A conservative writer immediately attacked Gore's claim. The Scientific American article "did not say we needed an area 100 miles on each side, which is 10,000 square miles," William Tucker of the American Spectator wrote a day after Gore's testimony. "The article stated, 'To meet the 2050 projection [of electrical demand], 46,000 square miles of land would be needed..." Gore's spokeswoman, Kallee Kreider, said Gore had cited the wrong source — he intended to cite this report from Environment America, an advocacy group that promotes clean energy. That report in turn cites the U.S. Energy Department, which does indeed say on this Web page , "The solar energy resource in a 100-mile-square area of Nevada [otherwise known as 100-miles-squared, or 10,000 square miles] could supply the United States with all its electricity using modestly efficient (10%) commercial photovoltaic modules." That's a compelling source, but the apparent contradiction cited by Tucker made us wonder. So we called two of the authors of the Scientific American piece, James Mason and Ken Zweibel. They said that Gore was probably correct, and in fact their article — far from contradicting his claim — contains data that support it. Mason and Zweibel said that when they wrote that 46,000 square miles would be needed to meet the electricity demand in 2050, they were assuming electricity would provide a much greater portion of the country's energy than it does now — including, for example, 344 million plug-in hybrid vehicles. A 10,000-square-mile solar plant could well provide today's electricity needs, they said. Here's how (dense math ahead; proceed with caution): As graphics accompanying the print version of the Scientific American piece indicate, the sun in parts of the Southwestern United States provides an average of about 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day of solar radiation. Take that 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day and multiply that by the 365 days in a year and you get 2,372 kilowatt hours per square meter per year. We'll round it to 2,400. Solar-electric systems could — optimistically — convert about 15 percent of that to electricity. That comes to 360 kilowatt hours per square meter per year. You can't cram solar panels close together, because they would cast shadows on each other. For every square meter of solar panel in the southwestern U.S., you need 2.5 square meters of space. Once you account for that (by dividing 360 by 2.5), you find each square meter of a solar installation could produce 144 kilowatt hours per year. There are 25.9 billion square meters in 10,000 square miles. Multiply that 25.9 billion by the 144 kilowatt hours that a square meter can produce in a year, and you get 3,729 billion kilowatt hours per year. The U.S. consumes about 3,900 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year, according to the federal Energy Information Administration . So Gore's estimate was close enough considering the many uncertainties involved. "I don't think you've found a serious blunder," said Zweibel, director of the Institute for Analysis of Solar Energy at George Washington University. "Anywhere from 100 to 150 miles per side will easily produce all the electricity in the United States with any solar technology," said Mason, director of the American Solar Action Plan and the Renewable Energy Research Institute in Farmingdale, N.Y. That said, there are all sorts of reasons why building a 10,000-square-mile solar installation would be even more difficult than it sounds. For one, we would need a place to store the electricity so that it could be doled out in the dark night hours and on cloudy days. Mason and Zweibel suggest using the solar energy to compress air underground in caverns, old mines, aquifers and depleted natural gas wells. Then it could be released on demand to turn turbines that would generate electricity. Also, we would need a vast new system of transmission lines. To pay for that and other necessary improvements, Mason and Zweibel call for $420 billion of government subsidies. Even given all the challenges, they, like Gore, argue large-scale solar development makes sense when you consider the enormous amounts of land, energy and money we currently use to mine fossil fuels, produce electricity from them and control their pollution. Gore didn't exactly tell the whole story, since the 10,000-square-mile solar farm would not do the job "in and of itself" without other infrastructure improvements. But he was testifying on the broad issue of climate change, not delivering a lecture on building a solar plant. And his misattributing the claim to Scientific American is not a significant inaccuracy, since that article did contain statistics that support the claim. We find Gore's claim True.

pomt-14862	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has "no congressional oversight."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/14/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-consumer-financial-protection-b/	During the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Carly Fiorina brought up an issue that delves deep into the weeds of the federal regulatory system. She took aim at the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a law passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by President Barack Obama that placed significant new regulations on the financial services sector. Fiorina called Dodd-Frank "the classic of crony capitalism. The big have gotten bigger, 1,590 community banks have gone out of business, and on top of all that, we've created something called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a vast bureaucracy with no congressional oversight that's digging through hundreds of millions of your credit records to detect fraud. This is how socialism starts, ladies and gentlemen. We must take our government back." We wondered: Was Fiorina right that, unlike other federal regulatory agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has "no congressional oversight"? We took a closer look. An unusual structure First, some background on the bureau. Its mission is to "protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws." This includes enforcing consumer financial protection laws, following up on consumer complaints, promoting financial education, conducting research on consumer behavior, and monitoring financial markets for risks. New agencies that seek to police well-established industries are often controversial, and the bureau is no different. Its champion was Elizabeth Warren, a liberal icon who was considered the likely first head of the bureau until her appointment was effectively blocked by Republicans in Congress. Obama’s second choice, Richard Cordray, was also kept from taking office until Obama sidestepped GOP lawmakers by making a controversial recess appointment. Cordray was ultimately confirmed with some bipartisan support in 2013. (The bureau declined to comment for this story. We did not hear back from Fiorina’s campaign.) Fiorina has a point that by Washington standards, the bureau is unusually unfettered by oversight, congressional and otherwise -- something specifically designed to limit any influence by the financial sector it oversees. Perhaps the clearest example of this long leash is that, unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on appropriations for its funding. That means that Congress doesn’t approve the bureau’s budget every year. Instead, the bureau’s operating budget comes from the Federal Reserve, currently capped at 12 percent of the Fed’s total operating expenses. This works out to about $600 million a year today. Those who are skeptical of the bureau say that seriously hampers Congress’ oversight ability. "Oversight without any budget leverage has turned out to be completely hollow," said Todd J. Zywicki, executive director of the George Mason Law and Economics Center at George Mason University and a frequent commentator on the issue. Brenden D. Soucy, a Miami-based lawyer, wrote an article critical of the the bureau’s degree of congressional oversight in the Florida State University Law Review in 2013. He called the bureau "the most independent agency in United States history." "The CFPB’s extreme independence is touted as one of its greatest virtues, but history has shown that while independence from political pressure can be a virtue, near total isolation is not," Soucy wrote. Congress does have some levers of influence So it’s clear that Congress lacks an important -- and perhaps the most important -- lever for allowing lawmakers to oversee and guide the agency. But does that really equal "no congressional oversight"? Not really. Here are a number of ways in which Congress can oversee the bureau: • Congress can use legislation to change (or even abolish) the bureau. Indeed, there’s currently legislation in both chambers to enshrine a variety of transparency standards, some of which passed the House Financial Services Committee with bipartisan backing. • The Senate must confirm the head of the bureau. • The board’s director must testify at least twice a year before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; the House Financial Services Committee; and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The bureau must also submit semi-annual budget justifications. • The bureau is subject to an annual financial audit by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional agency. Combined with other checks and balances by other parts of the executive branch and the judicial branch, this is a list of oversight mechanisms "that will measure up against any regulatory agency in Washington," Warren, the bureau’s patron saint, wrote in an October 2015 op-ed. Other experts in government regulation and oversight don’t go this far -- but they add that Fiorina’s characterization is an exaggeration. ‘The CFPB has a lot longer leash that almost any other federal agency," said Donald F. Kettl, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. But, he added, "Congress did it on purpose. Congress can change it." And Soucy, the lawyer who wrote critically of the lack of congressional oversight, agreed that Fiorina went too far with this statement. "While the CFPB is nearly completely free of congressional oversight, it is not true to say that it has ‘no’ congressional oversight," he said. Our ruling Fiorina said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has "no congressional oversight." She has a point that where the bureau is concerned, lawmakers lack one of their strongest levers of influence -- the power of the purse. This makes it reasonable to say that the bureau has an unusually low amount of congressional oversight. However, "low" does not equal "none." Lawmakers are already flexing their muscles by advancing laws that would stiffen the bureau’s transparency rules, and the bureau’s Senate-confirmed director must testify and provide financial documentation at least twice a year to three separate congressional committees. The bureau must also be audited annually by an arm of Congress, the Government Accountability Office. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-00870	"We've seen the increase of alcohol use for underage kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/13/nancy-devaney/marijuana-legalization-opponent-says-says-alcohol-/	Supporters of legalizing recreational marijuana last week unrolled the latest bill to decriminalize possession of small amounts of cannabis, saying it could mean up to $58 million in tax revenue and give the state an economic boost. But those on the other side of the debate caution that legalization would lead to greater consumption of the drug and other social problems. Rhode Islanders may end up driving impaired and endangering others, for example. Minors would find it even easier to obtain the drug, even if it would remain illegal for people under age 21 under the proposed law, they said. One such opponent is Nancy DeNuccio, chairwoman of the Ocean State Prevention Alliance, a coalition that aims to limit the impact of marijuana on youth. In a WJAR-10 news report about the latest legalization legislation, DeNuccio expressed her concern about the potential consequences to young people of legalizing marijuana for adults. "We've seen the increase of alcohol use for under age kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21," she said. After a reader asked us to check her statement, we called DeNuccio, who immediately told us that she’d misspoken, that it was a mistake. Still, we decided that we’d look into her claim because whatever we found might help inform our readers as lawmakers take up the debate. Also, the statement was made in a television interview that remains publicly available. We found our answer in data from the Centers for Disease Control’s national Youth Risk Behavior Survey. It shows that, in Rhode Island, the percentage of teens who reported drinking alcohol at least once in the past 30 days had fallen dramatically since 1997 -- from 52 percent in 1997 to 31 percent in 2013. Similarly, the number of state high schoolers who said they consumed alcohol beyond a sip or two before age 13 had dropped over the same period, from 34 percent to 14 percent. The same goes for the percentage of teenagers who said they had five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past 30 days. Those numbers decreased from 32 percent in 1997 to 15 percent in 2013. As for the percentage of Rhode Island high schoolers who reported consuming at least one alcoholic beverage in their lifetime, those numbers dropped from a high of 79 percent in 2001 to a low of 62 percent in 2011. The Rhode Island numbers mirror what has been reported around the country. Nationally, the percentages of teenagers reporting drinking declined in three of the same four criteria. The only category to remain static was the percentage of high schoolers who said they drank five or more drinks in one sitting at least once in the past 30 days. Those numbers showed gains and losses throughout the time period, keeping it steady, according to the survey. Our ruling Nancy DeNuccio said, "We've seen the increase of alcohol use for underage kids even though alcohol has been illegal ... for kids under 21." We note that DeNuccio immediately acknowledged that she had misspoken. Given the evidence we found, we rate the claim False	None	Nancy Denuccio	None	None	None	2015-03-13T00:01:00	2015-03-06	['None']
pomt-09761	All the talk about socialism during the campaign made young people more interested in it by Election Day.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/02/michael-moore/michael-moore-says-young-people-are-increasingly-w/	Responding to conservative critics of President Barack Obama who say the president is leading the United States toward socialism, filmmaker Michael Moore says that wouldn't necessarily be out of step with public opinion. In his just-released documentary, Capitalism: A Love Story , Moore recites an episode from the 2008 campaign that prompted critics to say Obama was a socialist. But Moore then cites poll statistics to show that socialism is surprisingly popular with American young people. "By Election Day, the Rasmussen poll reported that only 37 percent of young adults now favor capitalism over socialism," Moore says in the film. He added in footnotes to the movie on MichaelMoore.com that "despite fear-mongering about the word, particularly around the time of the 2008 presidential election, young people are increasingly interested in socialism." The footnotes say the Rasmussen Reports poll found that "adults under 30 are essentially evenly divided: 37 percent prefer capitalism, 33 percent socialism, and 30 percent are undecided." We located the poll in question. It was taken in April 2009 using automated telephone calls. It had 1,000 adult respondents and a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. But the Rasmussen poll was taken five months after the election. So in the movie, Moore incorrectly describes the timing. At the point the poll was taken, Obama had been in office for nearly three months and the nation was in the depths of a recession. We should point out that over the years, critics have faulted Rasmussen for using machines rather than human interviewers, although it and other "robo-call" pollsters have won some acceptance. But more importantly, Rasmussen made no effort to make sure the people taking part in the survey understood the difference between capitalism and socialism. Rasmussen asked, "Which is a better system, capitalism or socialism?" The survey did not define either term. Among survey participants of all ages, 53 percent preferred capitalism, 20 percent preferred socialism and 27 percent said they were unsure. But for adults under 30, the group Moore was talking about, the results broke down as 37 percent for capitalism, 33 percent for socialism and 30 percent undecided. So Moore reported those results accurately. Let's look closely, though, at how Moore phrased his assertion. He said on his Web site that young people "are increasingly interested in socialism." That means their attitudes had to have changed to some degree over time. And we can't find evidence of that. And in the movie, he incorrectly pegged it to the November 2008 election. The polling firm's president, Scott Rasmussen, told PolitiFact that he has only asked that question once. So there's no way to compare his April poll question against other Rasmussen questions taken at different times. As for data by other pollsters, we contacted Karlyn Bowman, a veteran polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. She said that as soon as the Rasmussen question about socialism came out in April and began attracting media attention, she asked an intern to trawl through her polling databases to locate similar questions over the years. The intern found about a dozen items that addressed the question of socialism or free markets, but most of them aren't especially comparable to Rasmussen's question. For starters, the questions' wording is all over the map — a problem because pollsters warn that questions asked with different wordings can elicit different answers. One asked whether respondents agreed with the statement, "The United States would be better off if it moved toward socialism," while another asked whether they agreed with the statement, "Most people are better off in a free market economy, even though some people are rich and some are poor." More importantly, though, Bowman could find only a few polls for which the response data was broken down by age. She said that age breakdowns are not typically included in the public versions of polls. Still, we'll report the two other polls with age breakdowns that we or Bowman were able to locate. One was a January 2009 Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll. It asked, "Do you think it would be a good thing or a bad thing for the United States to move away from capitalism and more toward socialism?" Among respondents of all ages, 23 percent said it was a good thing, 65 percent said it was a bad thing and 12 percent didn't know. But among the under-30 crowd, 31 percent said it was a good thing, 54 percent said it was a bad thing and 15 percent didn't know. That's more favorable to socialism than the all-age sample as a whole, but the poll doesn't exactly show that under-30s are "evenly divided," as they were in the Rasmussen poll. So this result undercuts Moore's claim that socialism is running strong among America's young people. Not convinced by a poll sponsored by Fox News, which liberals accuse of having a conservative bias? Then try one from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, which has a reputation for being nonideological. The Pew center took a poll in March 2009 that asked, "Generally, do you think people are better off in a free-market economy, even though there may be severe ups and downs from time to time, or don't you think so?" Among all respondents, 70 percent agreed that people were better off in a free-market economy, while 20 percent disagreed and 10 percent said they didn't know. Among respondents under 30, the numbers weren't much different: 69 percent agreed that people were better off in a free-market economy and 26 percent disagreed, with 6 percent saying they didn't know. So, these responses also undercut Moore's notion that younger Americans are looking fondly at socialism. Scott Rasmussen has a theory. He suggested that support for capitalism as it is currently practiced is weakening, even as support for the theory of free markets remains strong. He cites an April Rasmussen survey that asked whether respondents favored a free-market economy or a government-managed economy. Overall, 77 percent of respondents favored a free-market economy, while just 11 percent favored a government-managed economy. For those under 30, free markets led, 79 percent to 8 percent. These results simultaneously bolster and undercut the claim in Capitalism: A Love Story . On the plus side for Moore, Rasmussen suggested in an interview that "the word 'capitalism' had taken on a lot of baggage partly because it was seen through the lens of taxpayer bailouts" and other scandals and collapses on Wall Street. These developments are a primary target of Moore's movie. “It’s hard for people to embrace a system that lets big business keep profits in good times and then asks for taxpayer bailouts when times are tough," Rasmussen wrote in a news release announcing the poll results. On the other hand, the fact that Rasmussen found Americans under 30 supporting a free-market economy over a government-managed economy by nearly 10-to-1 undermines Moore's notion that young people are warm to socialism. After we inquired about it, Moore's camp acknowledged to PolitiFact that the "increasingly" reference on the Web site was wrong. "It looks like the problem here is with the fact-check section of the our Web site," said Jonathan Schwarz, a spokesman for Moore. "Now, I’m completely sure that the attitudes of young adults toward economic matters ARE different than those of young adults during (say) the Reagan administration or the late '90s, but the movie doesn’t make that specific claim." He said that the Web reference will be changed. But while that item may be corrected on the Web site, the statement in the movie still says that "by Election Day," socialism was more popular with young people than it used to be. There does not appear to be much, if any, poll data to support that. So Moore has not convincingly shown that young people are reacting to the U.S. economic system by moving toward socialism. We rate Moore's statement False.	None	Michael Moore	None	None	None	2009-10-02T17:26:24	2009-10-02	['None']
pomt-08429	Says Christopher Little has "a history of working against environmental protection by defending the worst types of corporate polluters"	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/19/edwin-pacheco/pacheco-says-little-has-history-working-against-en/	Christopher H. Little, the Moderate Party’s candidate for attorney general, has tried to position himself as the candidate with the best experience to clean up Rhode Island’s politics and environment. Among other credentials, he cites his past chairmanship of Common Cause of Rhode Island and his three years as president of Save the Bay, beginning in 1987. So it was no surprise that someone might try to sully his Mr. Clean persona. Earlier this month, state Democratic Party Chairman Edwin R. Pacheco said Little’s claim to being an environmental champion was contaminated by his private law work for polluters. "Attorney general candidate Chris Little and his law firm have a history of working against environmental protection by defending the worst type of corporate polluters," Pacheco said in an Oct. 4 news release. Little dismissed Pacheco’s charges, saying "Mr. Pacheco, you need to actually read these cases you’re citing. If you do you will find that I was actually trying to help preserve the environment." An open invitation to look at the record. How could we refuse? Pacheco cites three instances in which he claims Little represented clients who were polluters: * Two Massachusetts towns that took the federal Environmental Protection Agency to court over a proposed sludge dump * A chemical company whose North Carolina facility was designated a hazardous waste site * A Massachusetts-based gasoline station operator that was fined for a gasoline spill in Brockton We’ll look at them one-by-one. The EPA suit Pacheco’s first claim involves the Massachusetts towns of Walpole and Norfolk, which challenged a 1989 federal Environmental Protection Agency study that said it was environmentally safe to build a landfill for dried sewage sludge in Walpole. Pacheco’s news release said the EPA found "the towns violated water pollution laws. … Chris Little was on the side of polluters and lost." That case stemmed from the 1980s effort to clean up Boston Harbor. New filtration plants were built to purify sewage effluent before it was discharged into the harbor. But the new plants generated sludge, which had to be dumped somewhere. In 1989, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority decided that somewhere was in Walpole, near the Norfolk town line. The towns objected and sued the EPA, claiming the EPA’s environmental impact study failed to address environmental threats the landfill would pose. Little — who was with Tillinghast, Collins & Graham at the time — said he joined the effort in 1989 or 1990 on Norfolk’s behalf, after he’d represented the Rhode Island town of Richmond in its successful fight to stop a 70-acre landfill from being built there. A federal district court judge ruled for the EPA, finding that the agency had considered the issues and met the federal standards for an impact study. In the end, the dump was never built. In 1993, after lobbying by the state, the EPA agreed to a plan to have the dried sludge trucked to dumps in Utah. Pacheco bases his criticism of Little on a summary of the suit on LexisNexis, an Internet data base, which said "the EPA found that the towns had violated the Water Pollution Control Act..." However, the judge’s decision shows that summary was inaccurate. Rather than violating water pollution control laws, the towns were trying to get them enforced more stringently. In fact, the ruling shows it was Little’s client who sought tougher environmental law enforcement. The North Carolina company Pacheco's news release said: In 1988, Little's law firm continued their quest against environmental protection when his firm defended a company that had a history of contaminating drinking water supplies." That company was National Starch and Chemical, a North Carolina firm that makes chemicals for textile and furniture makers. Pacheco’s statement cites a 1980s case in which National Starch was cited for storing 350,000 gallons of liquid waste in unlined trenches on its property. Because of the threat to local drinking water wells, the EPA ordered it to clean up the site. Little did represent National Starch, but it was in a case in Rhode Island, not North Carolina. National Starch was among several companies that used a New Jersey company to dispose of their waste. The companies thought their waste was going to an incinerator in New Jersey, but instead it was taken to Rhode Island, where it was illegally dumped at the Davis site in Smithfield, later designated as a Superfund site. The company agreed to pay $5 million toward the cleanup; Little represented it in subsequent lawsuits to recover that money from the disposal company that misled it. Little maintains his work for National Starch wasn’t to defend a polluter but to make sure the real guilty party paid financially. The oil company Pacheco’s third claim involved legal work Little did for gasoline station owner Mutual Oil of Massachusetts. His news release says Mutual Oil was fined $50,000 by the state for spilling gasoline at a station it owned in Brockton, a claim we verified through the Massachusetts attorney general’s report for fiscal year 2002. Little did represent Mutual Oil, but not in that case. Instead, it was in a Rhode Island zoning dispute. In 1999 a developer wanted to build a gas station in a Stop & Shop shopping center on Mendon Road, in Cumberland, near the Blackstone River. A group of local gas station owners that wanted to stop a new competitor convinced the zoning board to reject the plan, in part because the gas station would have been built on a floodplain of the Blackstone River. Little said Mutual Oil financed his work on behalf of the local station owners. To summarize: Pacheco was wrong when he said Little "was on the side of the polluters" in the Massachusetts sludge case. He was correct when he said Little represented a North Carolina company that caused pollution problems in that state. But Little’s representation of the company had nothing to do with that case. He was correct when he said a Little client had been fined for a spill in Massachusetts. But again, Little’s representation of the company had nothing to do with that spill. Bottom line: None of the cases Pacheco cites supports his attack on Little. We rate his statement False.	None	Edwin Pacheco	None	None	None	2010-10-19T00:01:00	2010-10-04	['None']
pomt-08170	A ban on earmarks greatly weakens the authority Congress has over spending, to the benefit of the executive branch.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/01/dave-obey/us-rep-dave-obey-says-earmarks-ban-would-greatly-w/	On Nov. 29, 2010, the U.S. Senate chamber rang with allegations that members were about to yield precious power to President Barack Obama and render themselves impotent when it comes to controlling spending. At issue was a proposed two-year moratorium on earmarks, those much-maligned special projects inserted by individual congressmen and associated with pork-barrel politics. The Senate ultimately voted down the ban, with opponents coming from both sides of the aisle -- though it could return once new members are sworn in come January. In the House, Republicans have voted in their caucus for a broad earmarks ban, but Democrats have not joined the move. The claim that a ban would save nothing has been thoroughly tested (PolitiFact National found that statement Mostly True). Receiving much less attention: The argument that a ban would greatly shift power to the executive branch. U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, says a ban would do just that. In a strongly worded statement, Obey suggested Republicans in Congress would be "turning total control over spending to the administration" by banning earmarks. He also suggested Republicans under the Tea Party philosophy were messing with powers that are "a large part of this institution’s constitutional authority." Obey, who is retiring from the House in January, spoke out after his replacement, Republican Sean Duffy, was picked to make the motion in the House Republican caucus to ban earmarks in the next Congress. So are Obey and other members on target in suggesting that an earmark ban could seriously affect the balance of power? First let’s look review some constitutional basics. Congress -- the legislative branch -- has "power of the purse" by virtue of Article 1 of the Constitution, which declares in part that "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." But the president -- leader of the executive branch -- first proposes the budget. That sets up a fundamental tug-of-war between the branches. Congress passes massive appropriations bills to fund the budget, and also uses very specific earmarks and other procedures to direct that budgeted funds be spent on a particular project or program, or be directed to specific contractors. Earmarks can bypass competitive processes. Insiders, outsiders and scholars are all over the map on the congressional powers question. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group that backed the earmark moratoriums, said Obey’s contention was "not accurate." Not only does Congress have the lead role in appropriations, it has the ability to do much more to hold the executive branch accountable than it does now, Ellis said. He argues Congress has relied narrowly on the relatively small-ticket earmarking process to the detriment of its oversight into broader spending issues. Members could force better bidding procedures, for instance, so the administration is held more accountable. "Earmarks are a lazy way of deciding where the funding goes," Ellis said. "Congress became fat, dumb and happy." Scott Lilly disagrees. He had a front-row seat to the spending game as a top Obey aide for more than a decade and later as director of the House Appropriations Committee staff. Now he’s a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. Lilly thinks Obey is on point because constitutional authority alone has not assured that Congress actually controls appropriations as intended. Of an earmarks ban, Lilly said: "I don't think it is a complete capitulation, but it is certainly allowing your opponent to tie one arm behind your back." Lilly, echoing many scholars, thinks Congress has lost big ground to the executive branch, in part due to partisanship that has seeped into the appropriations process. Threats of filibusters have become common in recent years, he noted. A recent example: Congress has not passed a budget or any appropriations bills for the 2011 fiscal year, which began in October. Lilly said earmarks are often parochial but sometimes have serious and broad policy purposes. He cited an example of a powerful members earmarking funds for more vehicle armor in war zones. If an administration disregards congressional directives or spends funds for purposes not requested in its budget or fails to address an important issue, earmarks can prove a corrective, said Lilly, who supports limits but not a ban on earmarks. A conservative in the Senate, Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) agrees with the Obey-Lilly camp. Inhofe argued on the Senate floor that earmarks is such a loose term that virtually all congressional appropriation authority could be compromised by a ban. "It would be nothing short of criminal to go through all the trouble of electing great, new anti-establishment conservatives, only to be politically correct and have them cede to Obama their constitutional power of the purse," Inhofe said. Inhofe, though, is in a minority in his party, which is under Tea Party pressure to reform on spending -- even if it means giving up power to a Democratic president. Obey himself cited several examples in his remarks for the Journal Sentinel: "Does (an earmark ban) mean that the administration’s request for military family housing or Army Corps of Engineers projects is to be considered the final word on the subject? Shouldn’t Congress be able to alter that list to avoid waste or focus scarce resources to the highest priorities? Does that mean that if there is a disaster, like the shooting at Fort Hood, Congress shouldn’t have the power to address it?" So that’s the practical insiders’ take: In the real world, an earmarks ban would limit congressional power but not necessarily snuff it out -- the power comes from the Constitution, so if someone chooses not to use it, it is not eliminated. A prominent scholar on separation of powers agrees to some extent on the limiting effect of a ban. University of Virginia law professor John C. Harrison preaches caution on using a "blunderbuss" approach to banning earmarks. A broad ban could indeed significantly restrict important congressional discretion, he said. Congress should restrict earmarks to eliminate pointless pork-barrel spending, but without limiting its powers to make specific appropriations where appropriate, Harrison said. Another outsider, from the right, views the constitutional argument as a red herring. Tad DeHaven, budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, was skeptical about the suggestion that an earmark ban would have a major effect on checks and balances at the Capitol. He said Congress had already abdicated authority by setting up many bureaucracies to oversee spending: "These guys are hiding behind the constitution as a matter of convenience." And that conveniently brings us to our assessment. In the end, the debate over congressional spending authority operates on two levels -- on paper, and in practice. Obey and others overreach by suggesting Congress would be bereft of spending oversight under an earmarks moratorium. The legislative branch would still have power but might have to find new ways to exercise it on occasion. But critics of a ban correctly point out that earmarks have been not only for local congressional projects but important tools used on larger policy questions. As they note, congressional authority has slipped -- and a blanket approach to banning earmarks could further tip the scales to the administration. Depending on where you sit, the glass is half full or half empty. We rate Obey’s claim Half True.	None	Dave Obey	None	None	None	2010-12-01T09:00:00	2010-11-18	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-04160	Says Charlie Crist and Missouri Rep. Todd Akin "hold same abortion views. No exception except the life of the mother."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/dec/20/lenny-curry/lenny-curry-says-charlie-crist-and-todd-akin-hold-/	Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist’s evolution from Republican to independent to Democrat has prompted speculation that he will take on Republican Gov. Rick Scott -- and led to sharp criticism from Florida Republicans. After CNN's Soledad O’Brien interviewed Crist on Dec. 12, 2012, RPOF chairman Lenny Curry took to Twitter to keep up the attacks on Crist. He tweeted: "Crist has a record of being rigid on guns, gays, marriage and abortion. He is making an indecent proposal to Dems." Curry also tried to link Crist with U.S. Rep. Todd Akin, a Republican from Missouri famous for his comment during his 2012 U.S. Senate bid that "legitimate rape" rarely results in pregnancy. Akin apologized for his comment and lost the election. Akin was a longtime supporter of bills that were backed by abortion opponents. He's now so famous that he is a point of reference for abortion rights. Curry tweeted about Crist: "BTW, he holds the same position as Akin on abortion." He later tweeted: "Answer: Todd Akin & @charliecristfl hold same abortion views. No exception except the life of the mother. Google it. Its all there." Democratic consultant Kevin Cate tweeted "I’ll let @politifact sort it out...." Okay, we will. We’ve fact-checked many claims about Crist and abortion -- and several about Akin and abortion. But here we wanted to check to see if Curry was correct to claim that Akin and Crist hold identical positions on abortion, that they are opposed except when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. It is somewhat difficult to compare the views held by Akin, a member of Congress, to Crist, a former governor, because they didn’t have to act on the same pieces of legislation. But we can compare their comments and their actions on some bills. Crist’s views on abortion Crist’s stance on abortion throughout his career is too complex to boil down to a sound bite -- even though Crist tried to do that himself at times. He has called himself "pro-choice" and "pro-life." Long before he ditched the Republican Party, he was accused of changing his stance on abortion depending on his political race. We will borrow in part from previous fact-checks to explain Crist’s views. In 1992 when he was running for the state Legislature, the Miami Herald wrote that Crist said he was "pro-choice" but opposed state-funded abortion. When he was running for the U.S. Senate in 1998 against Democrat Bob Graham, Crist wrote in a questionnaire for the Tampa Bay Times: "I am pro-choice, but not pro-abortion. I believe that a woman has the right to choose, but would prefer only after careful consideration and consultation with her family, her physician and her clergy; not her government." Crist said during that campaign that he would not support a constitutional ban on abortion. In 2006, when he was running for governor, Crist’s comments about abortion "puzzled activists on both sides of the abortion debate," the Miami Herald wrote after one TV forum. ''I'm pro-life on this issue, but I also understand that it's very important to respect the views of others, and I do,'' Crist said during that forum. "I don't think it's important to change the law. What I do believe is important is that we change hearts and not the law." During his 2006 campaign, he told a priest that if elected he’d sign an abortion ban similar to South Dakota’s which only included an exception for the life of the mother. But later Crist told an Associated Press reporter that he’d only sign such a ban if it also included exceptions for rape and incest. He repeated that summary of his views -- only accepting a ban that included exceptions for life of the mother, rape and incest -- at other times that year. Crist also said he would not support repealing Roe vs. Wade. When asked during his 2006 campaign about his opposition as a state senator to a 24-hour waiting period, he said the bill didn’t include an exception for medical emergencies. "There may have been a life-threatening situation that necessitates the procedure," he said. "That happens." While RPOF mailers defended Crist as a clear opponent of abortion, the Democrats issued press releases headlined, 'Criss-Crossin' Charlie's House of Waffles.'' In 2010, after leaving the Republican Party, Crist vetoed a bill that would have required women seeking abortions to get an ultrasound. He said he found the requirement that women pay for the procedure "punitive" and that the measure was "almost mean spirited." On the eve of the Republican National Convention in Tampa in August 2012, Crist endorsed President Barack Obama in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times and complained about growing Republican extremism, including on women’s issues. "Look no further than the inclusion of the Akin amendment in the Republican Party platform, which bans abortion, even for rape victims," Crist wrote. We gave Crist’s GOP-Akin comparison a Half True because the GOP platform clearly opposes most abortions but is vague on the detail and does not specifically say that it bans abortion for rape victims. Also, there is no official Akin amendment -- he didn’t play a role in drafting the platform language. RPOF’s explanation RPOF spokesman Brian Burgess told PolitiFact Florida in an email that "Crist is pro-life but allows exceptions for rape, incest and health of the mother." However, Curry only cited one in that tweet: life of the mother. Burgess backed up the claim by citing a 2006 interview of Crist, who was attorney general at the time, when he said that he would sign an abortion ban similar to South Dakota’s, which only allowed abortion to save a woman’s life. But Crist also said that South Dakota law was too restrictive and would only sign such a ban if it allowed abortions for victims of rape and incest. As for Akin, Burgess pointed to a couple of bills that he either co-sponsored or voted for that sought to ban funding for abortions but allowed for exceptions including victims of rape and incest. On Nov. 7, 2009, the House voted 240-194 with Akin in the majority for House Amendment 509 to H.R. 3962, a Medicare and pension bill, to prohibit federal funds for abortion services in the public option and prohibits individuals who receive affordability credits from purchasing a plan that provides elective abortions. The amendment said that it would include exceptions for the life of the mother, rape or incest. RPOF also cited a bill that Akin co-sponsored in 2011 -- the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. Akin was one of 227 sponsors of the bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. The bill prohibits federal funds from being used for any health benefits that include coverage of abortion, according to the Congressional Research Service. (Currently, federal funds cannot be used for abortion services and plans receiving federal funds must keep federal funds segregated from any funds for abortion services, the research summary stated.) The final version of the bill said such funding was permissible if "(1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself." The bill passed the house 251-175 in May 2011 and hasn’t had a vote in the Senate. Akin was consistent abortion opponent So it’s true that Akin supported a couple of abortion bills that contained exceptions. But those votes don’t paint a full portrait of Akin’s stance on abortion. Akin, a former Missouri Right to Life board member, has more than a two-decade record on abortion starting with his arrests in the 1980s at anti-abortion protests and history in the Missouri General Assembly where he was first elected in 1988. Over the years, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch would call Akin a "Republican anti-abortion leader" and "abortion foe" and "long a staunch opponent of abortion rights." In the state’s General Assembly, Akin fought against what abortion opponents call "partial birth abortions" and funding for Planned Parenthood. The National Right to Life Committee says Akin supported the group's position on 59 of its 60 key votes. NARAL Pro-Choice America gave Akin a score of zero in its 2011 scorecard. In July 2012, the Post-Dispatch wrote that Akin and his GOP Senate primary opponents were all "staunchly anti-abortion but with some nuances in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered." "There are some extreme medical conditions where the lives of both mother and child are at risk, in these situations he supports the doctors and patients making a decision that maximizes life," said Akin's campaign. A month later, he seemed to take a harder line against abortion and was less supportive of exceptions. Akin's controversial remarks came in a televised interview in August, when he said: "If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist." Akin apologized several times, but largely to say that he was wrong about his medical claim or used the wrong words -- not to walk back his implication that there shouldn’t be a rape exception. The Post-Dispatch wrote that Akin didn’t back down on his no-exceptions opposition: "Rape is a terrible, horrible tragedy," Akin said, when asked in a St. Louis radio interview whether he believes "morning-after" medications should be outlawed even for rape victims. "At the same time, I don't know that you fix one tragedy with another tragedy." Crist’s comments about Curry claim Crist spoke to us briefly about Curry’s claim. "I don’t even know Mr. Akin’s position except that it sounded pretty wacky during the campaign and inappropriate. ... The things Todd Akin said about this issue are pretty outrageous and has nothing to do with anything I believe." Crist spoke in generalities about his abortion stance: "I am pro-life but I would not impose my will on others," he said, and then referenced the bill he vetoed in 2010 that would have required women to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion. Crist also repeated a line he used in 2006 when asked by a reporter about his pro-life stance and what laws he would change: "I said I wouldn’t change any -- I’d rather change hearts than laws. This has been my position for quite some time." We later emailed Crist again to ask "did you ever -- or do you now -- support no exceptions except life of the mother?" Crist dashed off a quick response to Curry’s claim: "Completely wrong. He doesn't speak for me!" Our ruling Since Crist has taken both sides on abortion, it is possible to attack his view and be partially correct -- just pick a year, race and quote that matches the attack. In this case, Curry said, "Todd Akin & @charliecristfl hold same abortion views. No exception except the life of the mother." But even RPOF acknowledges that Crist's exceptions go beyond the life of the mother to include rape and incest. And RPOF ignores Crist’s words and actions that would conflict with Akin’s stances -- such as when Crist called himself "pro-choice." We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11091	"After Texas cut" its "two-year family planning budget by $73 million, one in four clinics closed their doors."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/jun/14/lupe-valdez/lupe-valdez-says-1-4-texas-clinics-closed-after-la/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Lupe Valdez tied state spending cuts on Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s watch to a plummet in women’s health services. In an online survey that came our way from Valdez on May 7, 2018, respondents were asked to mark their level of worry in response to this query: "Over the past decade, the GOP in Texas and across the country have been destroying women’s healthcare in every way they can in order to appease their special interest donors. After Texas cut their two-year family planning budget by $73 million, one in four clinics closed their doors." Those figures sounded familiar. We checked on whether they hold up. We previously noted that actions set in motion by the Republican-led 2011 Legislature drove down family planning spending in the state budget by more than $70 million from an existing two-year expenditure of $111 million to $37.9 million budgeted for 2012-13. To our refreshed inquiry this year, Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, confirmed the spending reduction. Mann told us by email, though, that the commission "cannot confirm the number of clinics that may have closed." Another HHSC spokeswoman, Carrie Williams, noted that programs and patient eligibility requirements also changed in subsequent years. A 2015 study Meantime, Oliver Bernstein of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for services to low-income Texans, reminded us by email that the 1-in-4 figure initially appeared in a study published in April 2015. That study, undertaken by entities including the Population Research Center at the University of Texas, estimated that 25 percent of Texas family planning clinics closed in the wake of the 2011 cuts. Researchers said they reached that percentage based on surveys and in-depth interviews of leaders of organizations that had previously fielded state family planning grants. The researchers summed up: "82 clinics closed or discontinued family planning services because of decreased funding. Many providers reported reduced hours and the elimination of evening or weekend hours. Reduced funding also led organizations to implement or expand systems requiring women to pay fixed fees (vs. as sliding scale) for services," the researchers said. The year before the cuts took effect, the study says, 217,884 women received family planning services funded by state-awarded block grants through Texas clinics overseen by 72 organizations while another state program served 119,083 women with incomes of up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level. On a related front, the researchers said: "In 2011, 71% of organizations widely offered long-acting reversible contraception; in 2012– 2013, only 46% did so. Organizations served 54% fewer clients than they had in the previous period." The study says: "In-depth interview respondents reported that they did not know what had happened to their former clients but suspected that they simply were not seeking reproductive health care." The study’s lead author, Dr. Kari White of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, elaborated at the time: "The 2011 funding cuts really had a dramatic impact on services for many organizations–including those who were not the targets of the legislation. They were simply unable to serve many women in need in their communities, and it will probably take some time before they are able to rebuild those connections and level of service." Lawmakers also targeted abortion providers The study further notes that lawmakers in 2011 also voted to bar state family planning aid from going to health care providers affiliated with organizations that perform or promote abortions such as Planned Parenthood; its clinics had been the Texas program’s biggest provider of contraceptive care and cancer screening, serving more than 40,000 women a year. Any rebound? Unsaid in Valdez’s survey question: State-budgeted family planning aid later escalated, programs were reorganized and, the HHSC says, there’s been an uptick in clinics. In 2015, we found True a claim that the 2013 Legislature increased spending on women’s health to record levels. The White-led study acknowledges that increase yet says programs backed by the fresh funding had yet to be implemented. Such measures would prove successful, the researchers said, "only if funding goes to organizations with necessary experience and training for efficient delivery of family planning services and if all Texans in need of services are eligible." In May 2018, we asked the researchers if the number of family planning clinics had turned around. In a statement sent by email, White reaffirmed the study’s finding that 25 percent of clinics initially closed or stopped providing family planning services. White said that while the research team hadn’t tallied clinics that subsequently opened, an April 2018 CPPP issue brief took note of the Texas HHSC allocating more aid to family planning for the fiscal year that ran through August 2017 "and," that brief says, the commission "re-opened contracts for the program for the first time in years, increasing clinic participation." That brief says more than 300,000 Texas women fielded government-supported family planning services in 2010-11, before the actions by the 2011 Legislature took effect, while about 215,000 women drew on such services in the fiscal year running through August 2016. According to the brief, the number of "Family Planning-contracted clinics" in Texas rose from 89 in 2016 to 258 clinics in 2017. "In comparison," the center wrote, "before the huge funding cuts that took effect in" fiscal "2012, about 290 clinics were contracted in the program in both 2010 and 2011." Put another way, it looked like Texas clinics with government-funded family planning services were lately down by 32, or 11 percent, from the clinics offering such services before the legislative moves of 2011. We asked the center if its 2018 analysis demonstrates a substantial rebound in clinics. By email, Bernstein pointed again to the 2015 study reporting the 25 percent decrease. He otherwise said HHSC figures show state-contracted family planning clinics escalating from as few as 89 in 2016 to 258 in 2017 and 246 in 2018. We also tried to gauge any rebound in Texas women getting state-supported family planning help. On April 26, 2018, a little more than a week before Valdez made her claim, the HHSC posted a report stating that in the fiscal year that ran through August 2017, 219,396 low-income Texans received family planning services through state-supported programs. (Earlier, the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights, estimated in a 2016 report that as of 2014, nearly 1.8 million Texas women needed publicly funded contraceptive services and supplies.) A day later, the CPPP said in a blog post about the report that in "good news," the number of Texas women fielding family planning services with state aid escalated 29 percent from 2016 to 2017. But, the center said, the number of women served still trailed--"by tens of thousands"--women served by government-backed family planning programs before the 2011 actions. We also queried the Texas Women’s Health Care Coalition, a nonpartisan group that says it’s dedicated to improving the health and well-being of women, babies and families by assuring access to preventive care for women. The group’s chair, Evelyn Delgado, said by phone there’ve been significant increases in women served by state-backed family planning programs though she and Erika Ramirez, the coalition’s director of policy and advocacy, said Texas has yet to serve the number of women who fielded such services before the 2011 actions. Williams, the HHSC spokeswoman, separately counseled by email against comparing 2016 or subsequent state counts of women drawing on state-supported family planning to past tallies because, she said, the older figures include double-counting due to patients drawing on multiple programs. Our ruling Valdez said that after Texas cut family planning spending $73 million, one in four clinics closed their doors. A 2015 study found that after Republicans made that cut--also barring such aid from entities associated with abortion providers--one in four family-planning clinics closed. But this statement also lacks information in that there was subsequently a burst of state family planning aid, a reorganization of programs and a rebound in clinics though, it appears, not a full catch-up in women getting services.

pomt-04821	"13,000 Floridians are able to vote -- but their governor won't tell them."	false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/17/aclu-florida/aclu-says-rick-scott-wont-tell-13000-ex-felons-the/	Florida has faced heat for how it handles restoring the rights of felons -- an issue with partisan and racial undertones. A disproportionate number of felons are black and blacks lean Democratic. Who has a right to vote is a pressing concern a few months before the Nov. 6 presidential election. The ACLU of Florida sent an email to supporters Aug. 3 sounding alarm bells and suggesting that thousands of ex-felons have been disenfranchised due to "suppression tactics" by the Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott. The headline of the email stated: "13,000 Floridians are able to vote -- but their governor won’t tell them." Here is part of the body of the email: "... Because of a public records request we sent last week, we discovered thousands of rights restoration notifications sitting in storage in Tallahassee having never reached their intended recipients. As a result, there are over 13,000 Floridians who have regained the right to vote, but haven't registered to vote because they may not know that they can." The email later continued, saying that Scott "won't even help the Parole Commission inform citizens that their voting rights have been restored. There were no public announcements from the governor's office to let people know these letters existed, and no effort to allocate enough resources to help the underfunded Parole Commission. These critical documents are simply gathering dust." There are a lot of claims in that email but the one we wanted to check was the headline: Are there 13,000 Floridians able to vote but Scott won’t tell them? Restoration of rights changes under Crist In 2007, then-Gov. Charlie Crist said that the civil rights restoration process was too cumbersome, and he led the effort to allow non-violent criminals to get their rights restored without hearings if they completed their sentences and paid restitution if required. The change meant that 80 percent of ex-felons were eligible to get their rights restored without applying. (Felons lose their voting privileges in Florida.) Starting in April 2007, the Florida Parole Commission sent about 89,300 ex-felons certificates telling them their voting rights had been restored. "The last printed certificates were sent in September 2008," said Jane Tillman, spokeswoman for the Florida Parole Commission. "We sent 6,000 of them. We had a pizza party late in the night stuffing and licking envelopes." But the parole commission didn’t always know where to send the correspondence telling ex-felons they could now vote. The commission relied on the last address the former inmates provided to the Department of Corrections, but some people had gotten out of prison years -- even decades -- ago. About 35,000 of the certificates were returned undeliverable starting in 2007 through March 2011. If a letter was returned with a forwarding address it was resent, Tillman said. Starting around 2011, the commission checked state drivers' license records in an effort to find updated addresses. The state was able to track down about half of the remaining list, leaving 17,604 undeliverable by the spring of 2011. Those undeliverable certificates have been sitting in boxes at the parole commission’s office in Tallahassee. (Tillman said nearly all of them are restoration of civil rights but about 5 percent are for something different, such as pardons.) The ACLU picked up on the 17,604 yet-to-be-delivered certificates as part of a public records request. After comparing that list of names to a statewide voter database, the group found 13,517 people who were eligible to vote still hadn’t registered. That is the genesis of their claim. The letter is not needed to register to vote The certificate itself doesn’t mean an ex-felon is automatically registered to vote, and an ex-felon doesn’t need to have a letter in order to register to vote. Ex-felons whose voting rights have been restored simply have to go through the typical process of registering to vote in their home county. In Broward County, elections registration officials don’t ask for a copy of the certificate but will accept it if the person brings it, said spokeswoman Mary Cooney said. If an ex-felon tells elections officials that he isn’t certain if his rights have been restored, county officials will check the Parole Commission Office of Executive Clemency’s website. The Miami-Dade Supervisor of Elections office provided a similar account of the steps they take to register such voters. Spokeswoman Christina White said if the clemency office website doesn’t show the applicant’s rights have been restored, her office gives the applicant the website, email and phone number for the clemency office. We read the ACLU’s claim to Reggie Garcia, a longtime clemency attorney based in Tallahassee. Garcia argues cases before the governor, so he has a reason not to criticize Scott. But he said Crist’s initiative was well publicized and that if someone wants to become a voter, the ex-felon could make an effort to get in touch with the parole commission. "I don’t think it's Gov. Scott’s fault that the (commission) has now tried at least two, maybe three times, that … (they) can’t reach 20 percent of the people because of passage of time, mobility, change of addresses," he said. Garcia also said it's not unusual for someone leaving prison to change their address multiple times within their first year of leaving prison. It’s also possible, of course, for people on the list to be dead, to have moved out of state or simply not want to registered to vote. An important note: The voting rules for ex-felons changed in 2011. In February 2011, newly elected Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi said it was too easy for felons to get their rights restored. One month later Bondi, Scott and the rest of the all Republican Cabinet adopted new rules making it harder for ex-felons to vote, including getting rid of any automatic restoration of rights and adding a minimum of a five-year waiting period to apply -- a process that can take years. Since then, only 175 felons have had their rights restored. A second important note: The people who received a certificate -- or those who have one sitting in Tallahassee -- are eligible to vote under the old rules unless they lost that right because they re-offended. Our ruling The ACLU said in the headline of an email, "13,000 Floridians are able to vote -- but their governor won't tell them." But the state has tried to reach those potential voters using the address information at their disposal. In 2007 and 2008, the parole commission sent the ex-felons a certificate based on the last address they provided to the state Department of Corrections. When about 35,000 letters were returned undeliverable, the commission re-sent letters and cut that number in half. Also, the ACLU is blaming Scott for an issue that seems largely beyond his control. Some of the 13,000 could have moved out of state or died. And it’s possible some of the 13,000 don’t want to register to vote. Lastly, the certificate isn’t necessary to register to vote. Ex-felons can check to see if their rights were restored on the commission’s website, calling the commission or asking for help from their local supervisor of elections. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01496	"Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4"	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/25/ryan-lizza/lizza-says-obama-has-bombed-more-nations-bush/	The irony of President Barack Obama, Nobel Prize winner and putative anti-war candidate, launching extensive airstrikes in Syria, quickly led to comparisons with his predecessor, President George W. Bush. Ryan Lizza, Washington correspondent for the New Yorker summed it up in one tweet. "Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4." We asked Lizza for his list and he sent us this: Bush: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Somalia. Obama: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. As we fact-checked Lizza’s statement, we found little reason to challenge the nations he named. If anything, he shortchanged both presidents. There is no dispute whatsoever about airstrikes in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Bush launched wars in the first two countries and drone strikes in Pakistan have been in the news for a long time, with or without official acknowledgment. Airstrikes in those places continued under Obama. Somalia falls largely in the same category as Pakistan. The New York Times, BBC News and other news organizations reported airstrikes as early as 2007 against people linked to the al-Qaida network. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news service based at City University London, maintains a running list of U.S. military actions in a number of countries, including Somalia and Yemen. The bureau annotates each incident with links to press reports. By its tally, American drone strikes against suspected terrorists in Somalia occurred under both Bush and Obama. The same pattern holds in Yemen. BBC News and Time magazine reported a CIA-directed drone attack in Yemen in 2002. This would increase Bush’s total to five countries, rather than the four Lizza cited. Lizza said he left Yemen off of Bush’s list because it was a "one-off strike, rather than a more sustained bombing campaign. Probably deserves an asterisk." The air attacks on Libya that helped topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 under Obama are well documented. In March 2011, the United States and British warships fired over 100 cruise missiles to destroy Libyan air defenses. And, of course, there’s now Syria. We might stop there but it is possible that the Philippines should be added to the rosters for both presidents. The New York Times cites "three current and former intelligence officials" as saying that drones fired Hellfire missiles at a suspected militant camp in the Philippines in 2006. And Akbar Ahmed, a professor at the American University School of International Service, wrote on the Brookings Institution website that a similar attack took place in 2012. If these reports are accurate, the totals for Bush and Obama would rise by one. The final, maximum number would be Bush 6: Obama 8. PunditFact cannot confirm the authenticity of these reports. This framework says little about the nature of each president’s air campaigns. According to Air Force data, the number of munitions dropped in Afghanistan and Iraq declined about 35 percent between 2007 under Bush and 2009 under Obama (adjusted for missing data in 2009). However in Afghanistan, the number of sorties with at least one weapon release and the number of munitions used rose in 2010 and 2011 before falling in 2012, according to Air Force data. The number of weapon releases fell greatly in 2013. The country tally also tells us nothing about the general military strategy under each president. Bush initiated the war in Iraq, while Obama was elected on the promise to end it. Our ruling Lizza said that Obama has bombed seven countries to Bush’s four. Depending on your view of Bush’s reported drone strike into Yemen, he may have slightly undercounted Bush’s tally. Both presidents also may have bombed the Philippines. But it's hard to fault Lizza for the numbers we use. We rate his claim True.	None	Ryan Lizza	None	None	None	2014-09-25T10:47:44	2014-09-22	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-02045	Says Barack Obama broke a decades-old policy of "not negotiating with terrorists."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/01/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-us-policy-has-changed-now-we-make-deals-t/	On Saturday, May 31, 2014, President Barack Obama announced from the Rose Garden that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl — America’s only prisoner of war — was freed by his Taliban captors after five years in custody. But Bergdahl’s release came at a cost: In return, the United States agreed to turn over five Taliban officials being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, prison to the country of Qatar. By Sunday, debate over the decision spilled into the political talk shows. White House national security adviser Susan Rice, speaking on ABC’s This Week, said Obama was justified because the U.S. was at war with Bergdahl’s captors even if it wasn’t in the traditional sense. But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took exception to that characterization. "Ambassador Rice basically said to you, ‘Yes, U.S. policy has changed. Now we make deals with terrorists,’ " Cruz said. Later, Cruz added: "The reason why the U.S. has had the policy for decades of not negotiating with terrorists is because once you start doing it, every other terrorist has an incentive to capture more soldiers." The merits of the swap will continue to undergo scrutiny, but we wanted to look at Cruz’s assertion that Obama deviated from long-standing policy. Presidents throughout history have reiterated that the "United States does not negotiate with terrorists" (we found several instances of Obama's State Department saying as much), but do they always hold true to that mantra? Back to the Founding Fathers First, whether the war in Afghanistan is a war in the traditional sense or something much different has clouded legal and military debate since it began. Similarly, whether the Taliban, who have controlled parts of Afghanistan, is a traditional enemy or a terrorist group akin to al-Qaida, remains a contentious debate. (Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel claimed on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday that the United States wasn’t negotiating with terrorists when it secured Bergdahl’s release.) The United States has a long history of negotiating prisoner trades in times of war. But does it have a history of negotiating with terrorists, as some might classify the Taliban? According to experts we spoke with, it does. (For his part, Cruz didn’t respond to a request for comment by our deadline. We'll add their response to this item if we hear from them.) "There’s little that’s actually new here," said Mitchell Reiss, who worked in the State Department under President George W. Bush and served as national security adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. "It may be new to certain individuals. Whether it’s new or not is not as important as whether it’s sound policy and promotes national security. That’s the ground where there’s a more legitimate debate." In his book, Negotiating with Evil, Reiss wrote that America actually has a detailed history of negotiating with terrorists and rogue regimes that support terrorist activity. How long? Even the Founding Fathers struck agreements with terrorists of the time: pirates. George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson "accommodated what today would be viewed as terrorists," Reiss wrote. "They each authorized payment to the Barbary pirates, and the U.S. Senate even ratified a treaty that enshrined the annual provision of naval supplies as ‘protection.’ " A century later, President Teddy Roosevelt granted demands from the descendants of those pirates to secure the release of captured American resident Ion Perdicaris. Recent history To his credit, Cruz said the policy of not engaging terrorists was decades old, not centuries. But there are more recent examples where, as Reiss wrote, "American presidents have negotiated with terrorists and rogue regimes to secure the release of hostages, to arrange temporary cease fires and to explore whether a more permanent truce might be possible." Here’s a few, according to Reiss’ book: After the North Koreans captured the U.S.S. Pueblo in 1968, President Lyndon Johnson apologized for spying as part of negotiations to secure the release of 83 American prisoners. In 1970, President Richard Nixon pressured Israel, Switzerland, West Germany and Britain to release Palestinian prisoners after two airlines were hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. During the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 to 1981, President Jimmy Carter agreed to unfreeze $8 billion in frozen Iranian assets after more than a year of negotiations with the Iranian revolutionaries. In perhaps the most famous swap, after seven Americans were captured in Beirut, Lebanon, President Ronald Reagan agreed to send missiles to Iran in what became known as the Iran-Contra scandal. President Bill Clinton’s administration sat down with Hamas in attempts to negotiate peace with Israel. His administration also worked directly with the Taliban nearly two decades ago on several occasions to see if the group would hand over Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders. Reiss also noted that President George W. Bush engaged in negotiations with Iran and North Korea even after decreeing them part of the "Axis of Evil." James Jeffrey, a former ambassador to Iraq under Obama and deputy national security adviser for George W. Bush, agreed that "there have been many cases of negotiations with terrorists or rogue regimes for the return of Americans." But he added: "releasing terrorists in exchange for captives, however, is rare." One recent example came in 2010, when the United States released Shia cleric Qais al-Khazali to the militia group Asaib al-Haq in exchange for Peter Moore, a private British contractor, and the bodies of Moore’s security officers. Asaib al-Haq is a militia group allegedly funded by Iran and headed by al-Khazali and staged and executed several attacks in Iraq that resulted in the deaths of U.S. soldiers. Our ruling Cruz said Obama changed "decades" of policy of not negotiating with terrorists when he brokered the deal that brought Bergdahl home. Even though presidents and officials often say "we do not negotiate with terrorists," it has not proven to be a hard-and-fast rule. Obama’s actions so far do not signal a change in policy, but rather the latest in a long line of exceptions presidents have made throughout recent history. We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-09359	The Florida House is "holding the FINAL public hearing" of a controversial education bill in the middle of spring break..."when they hope (teachers) are not watching or listening."	false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/02/florida-education-association/teacher-tenure-hearing-spring-break/	A controversial education bill that would link teacher pay increases to student performance is scheduled to get its final public hearing April 5, 2010, and the teachers union fighting the measure is lining up troops to voice opposition. The Florida Education Association is calling on educators to appear before the House Education Policy Council during a public hearing scheduled to start at noon. Their rally cry comes with a not-so-subtle dig at Tallahassee lawmakers. "The Florida Senate held hearings on this terrible piece of legislation during FCAT testing. So it should be no surprise that the Florida House of Representatives is holding the FINAL public hearing on this bill smack dab in the middle of spring break...when they hope you are not watching or listening," the FEA says in a message on its Web site. "The FINAL hearing has been scheduled for Monday, April 5th from 12:00 noon until 8:15 p.m. and they are hoping you don't show!" In this item, we wanted to see if the Florida Legislature is scheduling this critical hearing so as to avoid a confrontation with teachers. The education initiative -- SB 6 in the Senate and HB 7189 in the House -- would link teacher pay increases to student performance, eliminate long-term job security for new teachers and require end-of-course exams for subjects not covered by the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test starting in the 2013-2014 school year. The legislation would cause a major shift from current teacher pay scales, which base salaries on degrees and years of experience. The Florida Education Association says the bill, which passed the Senate 21-17 on March 24, 2010, and awaits action in the House -- could push experienced teachers out of the classroom. To judge the FEA's claim, we wanted to see how many school districts will be on spring break on April 5, 2010. So we built this spreadsheet after visiting the Web sites for each of Florida's 67 public school districts. By our calculation, 33 of Florida's public school districts will be closed April 5, 2010. Some of the schools will be on formal spring break. Others are having a teacher work day, while students are off. What does any of that mean? On the surface, it seems to mean a lot of teachers won't be working and could possibly attend the bill hearing, if they chose. From the teachers' perspective, that would be a good thing, right? But then we looked back at the FEA's statement. The FEA previously was upset that the Senate held its hearings during FCAT testing, when teachers were working. That had us confused. The FEA was upset hearings were held when teachers had to be working. And now the group's upset because the House is holding hearings when teachers are off. Is there some other category between working and not working? But that's only part of the problem with the FEA's statement. The Florida Constitution limits the Legislature to one, 60-day legislative session each year. The Constitution also says the session must begin in March (the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March). The constraints in many ways bind the hands of legislators. The bill the House Education Policy Council will consider, HB 7189, wasn't filed until March 25, 2010 -- after its companion piece was approved by the Senate. The measure had a hearing at the House PreK-12 Policy Committee on March 25, 2010 (passing 9-6) and was forwarded to the House Education Policy Council. April 5 is the council's first meeting since March 17, 2010. If the bill advances through the House Education Policy Council, it must be passed by the full House. If the bill differs from the version approved in the Senate, the Senate would have to weigh in a second time. The session is scheduled to end April 30. That's a lot to happen in what amounts to 20 work days. House Republican spokeswoman Jill Chamberlin said House leaders decided to wait to consider the education reforms until the bill had passed the Senate. When it did, on March 24, the House was debating the state budget. Going forward, Chamberlin said, the weeks of April 12 and 19 have been set aside for more budget negotiations. Chamberlin said House leaders blocked eight hours for the education hearing, including evening hours to make sure people had an opportunity to speak. She also noted that many teachers visited Tallahassee in the last week of March -- when they were on spring break -- to oppose the measure. State Rep. Bill Heller, D-St. Petersburg, told PolitiFact Florida the compressed schedule is a perfect example of why the Legislature should have called a special session to handle proposed education reforms. "We can call a special session for a railroad project, when it only serves a portion of the state," said Heller, who opposes the bill and is the ranking Democratic member of the House Education Policy Council. "But when there's something that touches every city and every county, we're going to do just in a few hours." Heller agreed with concerns that people might not be able to attend the April 5 hearing, but he also expected a full committee room, and almost eight hours of public testimony. Heller said he has received about four e-mails in support of the legislation and about 1,600 against. Another 8,000 Floridians have signed a petition sent to Gov. Charlie Crist opposing the education proposals. House Speaker Larry Cretul's office had to add additional telephone lines to handle the flood of calls, more than 5,200, most of whom were from people opposing the bill, said Chamberlin, the Ocala Star-Banner reported.. That means the message is getting out. The state's big teachers union, the Florida Education Association, said the Florida House is holding the final hearing of a controversial education bill in the middle of spring break, when "they hope (teachers) are not watching or listening." We find the scheduling of the hearing is much more of a practical matter than an attempt to stomp out the voice of teachers. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04974	"USA is #1 in gun violence."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/23/facebook-posts/the-us-is-no-in-gun-violence-is-it/	In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, Colo., Americans took to social media to express their views on guns and violence. A reader sent us one Facebook post about the extent of gun violence in the United States. It said, "USA is #1 in gun violence. Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead because of gun violence every day." In this item, we’ll look at the first part of that claim -- that the "USA is #1 in gun violence." International comparisons are always tricky, because there are differences from country to country in the definitions being used as well as the reliability and timeliness of the data. The most comprehensive international comparisons we found were published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Because of limited comparable data, we are defining gun violence as gun homicides. Let’s look at a few statistics: Annual homicides from firearms According to the U.N. figures, the U.S. had 9,146 homicides by firearm in 2009. That year, Colombia and Venezuela both exceeded the U.S. total, with 12,808 and 11,115 firearm deaths, respectively. Three other nations topped the U.S. amount in the most recent year for which data is available: Brazil (34,678 in 2008), Mexico (11,309 in 2010) and Thailand (20,032 in 2000). So the U.S. ranks high in this category, but not first. Even using the higher U.S. homicide figure of 11,493 in 2010 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cited here), the U.S. still doesn’t rank first internationally. Annual homicide rate for firearms Because the U.S. is so big, it's better to compare the frequency of firearm homicides per capita, usually expressed as firearm homicides per 100,000 in national population. According to the U.N., the U.S. had 3.0 firearm homicides per 100,000 in population in 2009. But there were 14 other nations that had higher rates in 2009, primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean: Honduras (57.6), Jamaica (47.2), St. Kitts and Nevis (44.4), Venezuela (39.0), Guatemala (38.5), Colombia (28.1), Trinidad & Tobago (27.3), Panama (19.3), Dominican Republic (16.9), Bahamas (15.4), Belize (15.4), Mexico (7.9), Paraguay (7.3) and Nicaragua (5.9). Three other nations had higher rates in 2008: El Salvador (39.9), Brazil (18.1) and Ecuador (12.7). So the U.S. doesn’t rank no. 1 when firearm homicides are adjusted for population. Where the U.S. does rank high in firearm violence The main area where the U.S. exceeds the firearm violence of other nations is in comparison to other affluent nations. Using the U.N. data, European nations -- even former eastern bloc countries -- typically have rates well below 1 per 100,000, or far less than one-third the frequency seen in the U.S. The pattern is similar in other advanced industrialized nations, such as Canada, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. One study published in 2011 confirms this finding. The study, published in the Journal of Trauma -- Injury Infection & Critical Care, found that firearm homicide rates were 19.5 times higher in the U.S. than in 23 other "high income" countries studied, using 2003 data. Rates for other types of gun deaths were also higher in the U.S., but by somewhat smaller margins: 5.8 times higher for firearm suicides (even though overall suicide rates were 30 percent lower in the U.S.) and 5.2 times higher for unintentional firearm deaths. Our ruling The Facebook post says the "USA is #1 in gun violence." That's only true if you compare the U.S. with other affluent nations on a per capita basis. But widening the comparison to all nations, not just the richest ones, there are at least 17 other countries with higher per capita rates of gun homicides, most of them with rates astronomically higher than the U.S. rate. And measured by raw gun homicides, the U.S. doesn’t rank first -- at least two and possibly as many as five countries have had more gun homicides in recent years than the U.S. did. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2012-07-23T16:41:22	2012-07-21	['United_States']
pomt-01453	President Barack Obama "ordered our military to enlist illegal aliens."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/02/allen-west/obama-ordered-military-enlist-illegal-aliens-allen/	In case you missed this claim making the social media rounds, former U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., is saying that President Barack Obama has extended open arms to illegal immigrants to join our military. "Morning folks. While you were sleeping, Barack Hussein Obama took out his pen and ordered our Military to enlist illegal aliens," West posted on his Facebook page on Sept. 26. "In other words, this charlatan has allowed those who have disrespected our Constitution and are not citizens to take an oath to support and defend the very document, our rule of law, of which they are in violation....." West declares Obama’s action an "illegal order" and says the military shouldn’t follow it. The post caught several PolitiFact readers’ eyes. We will take a closer look at the claim, focusing on the part of West’s post that claims Obama "ordered our Military to enlist illegal aliens." West, who represented part of Broward and Palm Beach for a term before he lost running to represent a different district in 2012, is a retired Army lieutenant colonel and a Fox News contributor. Aides to West sent us several news articles, including one in the Military Times, a trade publication that covers the armed services. The article is about an expansion announced Sept. 25, 2014, by the Defense Department to the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest program. Before we get any further, we should explain that this program wasn’t created by -- or even under -- Obama. In December 2008, under President George W. Bush, the Defense Department announced a pilot program to temporarily allow certain legal aliens who were doctors or nurses -- or could speak certain in-demand languages such as Haitian-Creole, Chinese or Farsi -- to join the military. (Spanish is not on the language list.) The program started with 1,000 recruits, and in May 2012 the cap was raised to 1,500 a year through Sept. 30, 2014. The program has been open to asylees, refugees, and certain categories of people who hold non-immigrant visas, such as students or workers. All told, the MAVNI program has enrolled about 2,900 individuals since its inception, Defense spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Nathan Christensen told PolitiFact. Just days before the program was set to expire, Jessica Wright, the Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, signed a memo that extended the program through the end of fiscal year 2016 and allowed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients to apply. DACA -- announced by Obama in 2012 -- allows certain illegal immigrants who came to the country as children to apply for a renewable, temporary status that suspends deportation. As of the end of June 2014, about 580,000 individuals received initial deferred action under DACA. There are an estimated 11.7 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. Where West has a point is that some DACA recipients could eventually join the military program. But contrary to West’s sweeping suggestion, they would be a fraction of a very small program, experts say. The Defense Department doesn’t have any estimate regarding how many DACA recruits will join, but the cap of 1,500 recruits per year still applies. In the past, thousands more individuals have applied for the program than there are eligible spots. Margaret Stock, who helped create the MAVNI program when she worked for the Army and who now works as an immigration attorney, told PolitiFact that it will be difficult for immigrants with DACA status to pass the background investigation needed for top secret clearance. She predicted only a few dozen with DACA status will join MAVNI next year. "The Pentagon should have set up a separate recruiting program for the DACAs," she said. "They would make excellent military recruits, but hardly any of them can qualify for the MAVNI program, and the MAVNI program already has more than enough qualified recruits. Putting DACAs into the MAVNI program doesn’t make any sense," she said. We asked Christensen, the Pentagon spokesman, about the ability of those with DACA status to pass the background test and he told PolitiFact that the military currently does not enlist individuals with undocumented family members. However, the Defense Department "is working with the Department of Homeland Security to evaluate options to enlist individuals with undocumented family members and resolve the family members' status prior to the enlistee entering active duty.The Department continues to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in reviewing all MAVNI candidates." Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, expects only a small impact from this change. "Given the narrowness of the MAVNI program, the slight change made by the president, and the extremely limited number of people involved, I would rate the change as entirely insignificant," Janda said. Allowing DACA participants into MAVNI, he said, is "probably an attempt to court some favor with pro-immigration groups prior to the midterms, but it won’t be enough to make them happy. ... The odds of anyone getting in are very slim." Marc Rosenblum, deputy director at the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact that there are two likely reasons the program was expanded: It aims to attract people who have specialized skills but have a hard time getting into the military, and it falls broadly under the set of actions Obama can take related to immigration. However, it’s a very small piece of immigration reform, he said. Stock, who helped create MAVNI, also took issue with West’s assertion that Obama’s action was an "illegal order." "The Pentagon is acting pursuant to a statute, 10 USC 504(b)(2), which gives authority to the Service Secretaries to determine when someone’s enlistment is vital to the national interest," she told PolitiFact. We should also note that the changes open up the possibility of illegal aliens joining the military, but it is short of an order by the president that they be brought into this particular program, and it does not give them any special priority over other groups. It’s also worth noting some historical context. While the Department of Defense started this particular pilot program in 2008, non-citizens have served in the military since the Revolutionary War. About 5,000 non-citizens enlist for active duty each year. A 2011 consultant’s report for the U.S. Navy stated that about 4 percent of the military services are non-citizens. The report concluded that non-citizens are a valuable recruiting resource because of their large numbers, their useful language skills and the smaller likelihood they will leave the armed services quickly. In 2002, Bush signed an executive order to expedite naturalization of military members. Since then, the United States has naturalized about 93,100 members of the military. (Steve Blando, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that handles naturalization, told PolitiFact that all of the military members who were naturalized were lawful permanent residents -- that is, "green card" holders -- prior to becoming citizens.) Our ruling West said that Obama "ordered our military to enlist illegal aliens." He’s right that Obama’s decision to allow certain illegal immigrants to apply for temporary status under DACA then enabled the military to announce that those people could apply for the MAVNI program. However, West’s analysis exaggerates what’s going on. The program in question was initiated by Bush in 2008, before Obama was president. In addition, contrary to West’s sweeping suggestion, experts say it’s doubtful that many undocumented immigrants would be brought into the military. And Obama didn't order the military to take illegal aliens but rather made it an option. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11010	Says "Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama’s judicial nominees."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/10/josh-hawley/did-claire-mccaskill-vote-100-obamas-judicial-nomi/	The prospect of President Donald Trump’s second Supreme Court pick became an issue in the Senate midterm elections even before Trump tapped Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacant seat on the court. Josh Hawley, the Missouri attorney general who is challenging Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, put up a website — supremeclaire.com — to draw a contrast between his stance on judges and the incumbent’s. One of the statements on the website was that "Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama’s judicial nominees." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com From a Josh Hawley campaign website When we contacted McCaskill’s campaign, they did not dispute that she voted for all of Obama’s nominees. (They added that she has voted for 68 percent of Trump's judicial nominees.) So the substance of Hawley’s assertion is accurate. It’s worth noting, though, that the Republican ranks of senators that Hawley hopes to join also supported Obama’s judicial picks overwhelmingly. We looked at a database of Obama and Trump judicial picks maintained by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. For Obama’s tenure, the database includes 323 Obama nominees for district and circuit court seats who were ultimately considered by the Senate, along with the results of their confirmation votes. Here’s our breakdown of the results. The "no nay votes" category includes voice votes, approval by unanimous consent, recorded votes with zero nay votes: Degree of Senate opposition to nominee Obama nominees with this result No nay votes 220 Nay votes in single digits 45 Between 10 and 19 nay votes 10 More than 20 nay votes 48 In other words, 82 percent of Obama’s nominees received minimal opposition from Republicans. Eighty-two percent support is lower than the 100 percent support rate for McCaskill, but it does make Hawley’s seemingly black-and-white contrast between hard-line Republican opposition to Obama’s picks and blanket Democratic support a bit blurrier. This may surprise people who tune in to judicial nominations only for Supreme Court seats, battles that have become increasingly acrimonious. But for Obama’s lower-court nominations — and particularly for district-court seats, which are the initial trial-level federal courts — most nominees were easily confirmed. Why? Experts point to a few reasons. The first is that most judicial nominations that fail do so before a vote is cast. If opposition coalesces on the Senate Judiciary Committee, a nomination may be pulled before consideration (or a potential nomination may never be made), said Anthony Madonna, a University of Georgia political scientist. A second reason is that senators have historically been given an informal say on judicial nominations in their home states, enabling the most controversial candidates to be weeded before a nomination is even made, Madonna said. The GOP's ability to use these rules under Obama means that the nominations that made it to the floor "would have been likely to attract GOP votes," said Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist. McCaskill, for her part, was deferential to President George W. Bush’s judicial picks, Madonna said. He could locate only one McCaskill nay vote against a Bush judicial nominee — Leslie Southwick, who was up for an appeals-court seat — in McCaskill’s two years in the Senate when Bush was president. The growing acrimony over judicial nominations has dropped the percentage of slam-dunk nominations under Trump. The approval number, however, remains substantial. According to Wheeler’s data set, district-court nominations are still overwhelmingly approved without controversy: So far, 74 percent of Trump nominees have been confirmed by either zero nay votes or nay votes in the single digits. But for circuit court seats (that is, seats on appeals courts) only 17 percent of Trump’s picks have been approved with either zero nay votes or nay votes in the single digits. The remaining 15 Trump nominees have averaged 39 nay votes, meaning that most are getting some crossover support from Democratic senators, but not much. The increasing opposition under Trump, Wheeler said, stems from Senate Democrats’ anger over the GOP majority’s handling of Obama nominees toward the end of his tenure. In addition to blocking Obama’s third Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, for more than a year, Senate Republicans confirmed barely any circuit court judges during 2015 and 2016, which is "way below standard patterns for the final two years of eight-year presidencies," Wheeler said. Republicans counter that the confirmation system was broken well before 2015, including by the Senate Democrats’ decision to use the "nuclear option" to enable simple-majority approval for district- and circuit-court nominations in 2013. Our ruling Hawley said, "Claire McCaskill voted for 100 percent of President Obama’s judicial nominees." Senate Republicans also approved Obama’s nominees with minimal objections 82 percent of the time, and McCaskill voted for most of Bush’s nominees. Hawley's statement is accurate but requires a touch of clarification. That's our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-01948	"Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill that gives Florida's public officials an easy way to avoid disclosing their personal finances."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/23/bill-nelson/rick-scott-signed-law-give-politicians-easy-way-av/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson passed up the chance to run for governor against Rick Scott this year, but that doesn’t mean he’s done attacking the Republican incumbent. Nelson went on the offensive against the governor, with a page on his website entitled "The public has a right to know," asking for people to sign up to protest Scott’s alleged lack of transparency. The message also went out via email. "Last year, Gov. Rick Scott signed into law a bill giving Florida’s public officials and candidates an easy way to avoid financial disclosure of their assets," Nelson said in an email sent June 13, 2014. "Since then, Gov. Scott has been the only elected official to take advantage of this." Did Scott really sign a bill making it easier to hide assets from his financial disclosure statements? We’ll take a look at Florida law so you won’t be coming into this debate blind. Trusting disclosures While we didn’t hear back from Nelson’s office about clarifying this attack, it’s pretty obvious he’s referring to Senate Bill 2, a 2013 law unanimously passed by the Legislature that allowed state elected officials to establish a blind trust for their financial holdings and investments in order to prevent a conflict of interest. In essence, a blind trust is when someone turns over their portfolio to a third-party trustee, who then buys and sells stocks, bonds and other assets without the owner’s knowledge. Nelson is right that Scott signed SB 2 into law in May 2013. And yes, Scott is the only elected official in the state to use this law to put assets into a blind trust. The question is whether the law makes it easier to hide assets from the public. By definition, a blind trust makes it easier for a candidate to not disclose the investments that person owns. A blind trust allows Scott to declare a lump sum net worth without having to disclose the value of his vast portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments, some of which are regulated by the state and whose value could be directly affected by Scott's policies. But under SB 2, politicians must first disclose the assets they put into the blind trust. Scott did this in 2011, before the law was in place. It’s only after those assets are in the trust that they are not available to the public -- or the official who put them there. Other officials have used a blind trust in the past. Alex Sink did it in December 2006 after she became the state’s chief financial officer, an issue that became a somewhat contentious element of her failed gubernatorial run against Scott in 2010, because she voted for a new bond sale process that included her former employer, Bank of America. Sink created a blind trust on her own, without an ethics law addressing it. Scott did the same thing after being elected as governor, disclosing all his investments in 2010, then forming his own blind trust in 2011 to avoid a conflict of interest, he said. For years, the state ethics commission advised the Legislature to pass a law allowing blind trusts to deal with official conflicts of interest. In 2013, both the House and Senate unanimously passed SB 2. The bill regulated blind trusts and set the powers and duties of appointed trustees, including prohibiting them from telling their clients, such as Scott, what assets are bought or sold. These rules had not been in place prior to the bill’s passage, leaving blind trusts unregulated by the state. Jan Jacobowitz, director of the Professional Responsibility & Ethics Program at the University of Miami, says the problem in Scott’s case is more who is managing the portfolio. In this case, the custodian of Scott’s $72 million portfolio is Alan Lee Bazaar, the chief executive of a New York investment advisory firm with ties to Scott’s business dealings. "If you sort of have an insider managing your blind trust, it doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in the people," Jacobowitz said. While the state law provides some safeguards against conflicts of interest drawn from similar federal regulations, there were more than a dozen federal guidelines the state’s law didn’t incorporate (a point reported by the website the BrowardBulldog.org). These included making trust agreements public, allowing the ethics commission to remove trustees for misconduct and requiring periodic trust performance reports to the commission. Another problem with blind trusts is the while the owner may not manage the holdings, they still know what they own when they put those investments in the trust. "If what you’re putting in has a conflict of interest, then there’s a problem. You still know what’s in it," Jacobowitz said. In May, former Democratic legislator and constitutional law expert Talbot (Sandy) D'Alemberte filed a lawsuit brought by Jim Apthorp, challenging the constitutionality of the law. Apthorp, a Democrat and former chief of staff to the late Gov. Reubin Askew, said the law violated state requirements for financial disclosure. As of June 20, the court is weighing that claim. On June 16, Scott disclosed all of his financials in order to run for governor. In addition to his 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns (he and wife Ann Scott filed for an extension on their 2013 return), the governor ended his blind trust and revealed all the investments in his candidacy filing. That move wasn’t required by the 2013 law, which only says he must disclose the value of the blind trust, not its contents. Scott's net worth rose from $83.8 million in 2012 to $132.7 million last year, an increase of more than half, according to his financial disclosures. When he first ran in 2010, his net worth was a reported $218.6 million. He bankrolled his own campaign and has kept a campaign promise not to draw a salary from the state. One of the notable things missing from Scott’s investments was any interest in French oil services company Schlumberger Ltd., which is involved in Everglades drilling. Scott had a $135,000 investment in 2011 when he formed the trust, but the stake was gone in his June 16 disclosure. The former holding has since drawn an ethics complaint. After filing his paperwork, Scott put the investments into a new blind trust. Our ruling Nelson said "Scott signed into law a bill that gives Florida's public officials an easy way to avoid disclosing their personal finances." In terms of historical context and content of the Senate Bill 2, that part is true. Blind trusts do let officials shield financial holdings from disclosure requirements, and Florida law now allows officials to use those trusts. The broader implication of Nelson’s statement is that Scott is being dishonest about what he owns, and that it affects his ability to govern without creating conflicts of interest. After Nelson made the statement, Scott ended the trust and disclosed all his holdings, but he was following a law both recommended by the state ethics commission and approved unanimously by the Legislature. That law requires any official to disclose the assets being put into the trust before being turned over to a manager. There is debate over the law’s rules regarding choosing that manager and whether assets in that portfolio may present a conflict of interest. What goes into the trust would be publicly disclosed, however, while how it is managed afterward would not. That’s not the same as hiding assets from voters. In this case, Scott ended the trust to disclose the portfolio’s contents, anyway. Nelson implied the blind trust law makes it easier to hide personal assets. They may be hidden, but only after they are listed and turned over to a trustee. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2014-06-23T12:09:35	2014-06-13	['None']
pomt-11972	In the Alabama Senate runoff, "the candidate I endorsed (Luther Strange) went up MANY points after endorsement!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-luther-strange-gained-many-point/	The defeat of Sen. Luther Strange, R-Ala., in a Sept. 26 runoff election was a blow for President Donald Trump, who had endorsed Strange over his Republican rival Roy Moore. Strange’s loss even led Trump to delete several of his pro-Strange tweets shortly after the election. But Trump didn’t drop the subject, tweeting a few days later, "In analyzing the Alabama Primary race, FAKE NEWS always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after endorsement!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com When we took a closer look, we found weak support for Trump’s claim. The White House pointed us to a news release from Emerson College’s polling unit, which conducted several polls of the Alabama contest. The news release announcing the results of the Emerson poll conducted Sept. 21-23 included the following analysis: "Moore still leads Strange 50 percent to 40 percent, but the gap has narrowed. Strange trailed Moore by 14 points two weeks ago in Emerson’s previous Alabama poll … President Trump’s ardent support of Luther Strange in the recent weeks is the likely cause of the gap closing." (Trump’s rally in support of Strange was held on the evening of Sept. 22, meaning a portion of the survey occurred after that event.) The lines from the news release don’t provide as much support as Trump seems to think they do. For starters, there’s some question whether a four-point gain merits the label "MANY" -- or whether it’s even mathematically significant, given that the poll had a five-point margin of error. There are also questions about the timing. The Sept. 22 rally for Strange wasn’t actually the unveiling of Trump’s endorsement -- it had been public for weeks. Trump officially endorsed Strange on Aug. 8, a point Trump glossed over in his tweet. In other words, voters who had been paying attention during either the Aug. 15 primary (which included three major Republican candidates) and the Sept. 26 runoff (which included just Moore and Strange) would have known that Strange was Trump’s endorsed candidate. Finally, focusing solely on the Emerson poll leaves out a lot of other polling data that showed little movement toward Strange after either Trump’s formal endorsement or his rally. Here’s a rundown of polls from the RealClearPolitics.com archive: Poll Dates Moore Strange Leader in poll Primary polls WBRC-TV/ Strategy Research 7/24 - 7/24 33 35 Strange +2 RRH/PMI (R) 7/31 - 8/3 31 29 Moore +2 JMC Analytics 8/5 - 8/6 30 22 Moore +8 Trump endorsement 8/8 Trafalgar Group (R) 8/8 - 8/10 35 23 Moore +12 Emerson 8/10 - 8/12 29 32 Strange +3 Trafalgar Group (R) 8/12 - 8/13 38 24 Moore +15 Runoff polls Emerson 9/8 - 9/9 40 26 Moore +14 Gravis 9/21 - 9/22 48 40 Moore +8 Trump rally for Strange in Alabama 9/22 Emerson 9/21 - 9/23 50 40 Moore +10 0ptimus 9/22 - 9/23 55 45 Moore +10 Trafalgar Group (R) 9/23 - 9/24 57 41 Moore +16 These 11 polls show little convincing evidence that Trump’s official endorsement or his rally moved the needle for Strange. One Emerson poll, taken just after Trump’s official endorsement from Aug. 10 to Aug. 12, showed Strange up by three points. That was 11 points better than his eight-point deficit in the last pre-endorsement poll. However, in context, that Emerson poll looks like an outlier. To believe that Strange was really up by three points at that stage of the contest would require dismissing two polls by the Republican firm the Trafalgar Group that bookended the Emerson poll by two days on each side. One had Moore ahead by 12, while the other had Moore ahead by 15. As for polls after the rally, those undertaken at least partially afterward showed high and expanding leads for Moore. Indeed, if you look at the actual ballots cast -- the only vote that really counts -- Moore ended up outpacing Strange by an even wider margin in the runoff. "Moore’s edge over Strange grew from six points in the first round to nine in the second, so the actual votes suggest that Trump did not help Strange close the gap on Moore," said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Kondik also pointed to analysis of data from the polling firm 0ptimus by the Republican firm Firehouse Strategies. The analysis found that even as knowledge of Trump’s endorsement of Strange became better known among the electorate, Moore’s margin grew, from seven points on Sept. 13 to 10 points on Sept. 24, two days before the election. "We can concretely say that Donald Trump’s endorsement and active campaigning for Sen. Strange had absolutely no impact on the ballot," Firehouse Strategies concluded. Our ruling Trump tweeted that in the recent Alabama Senate runoff, "the candidate I endorsed (Luther Strange) went up MANY points after endorsement!" Trump can point to one poll that showed Strange narrowing Moore’s lead by four points after his rally. But other polling data doesn’t back this up, and his tweet glosses over the fact that he had announced his endorsement weeks earlier and that the increase in that one poll is so modest as to be within the margin of error. We rate his statement Mostly False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-10-02T17:23:04	2017-09-30	['Alabama_Senate']
pomt-04691	Mitt Romney said we should let foreclosures "hit the bottom."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/kamala-harris/Kamala-Harris-Romney-favors-letting-foreclosures/	To demonstrate the contrast between President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney, California Attorney General Kamala Harris pointed to the housing crisis. "We don't have to guess what Mitt Romney would have done if he were president. Because he told us," Harris said in a Sept. 5 speech at the Democratic National Convention. "He said we should let foreclosures—and I quote—’hit the bottom’ so the market could—I quote—’run its course.’" The Democratic National Committee made this claim in an ad last year, and PolitiFact checked it out. We found that a significant portion of Romney’s quote was omitted. Here’s a recap. What he said The quote about housing comes from an interview Romney gave to the Las Vegas Review-Journal’s editorial board last year. The newspaper posted video of his comments online, noting that they were in answer to the question, "How will you help with the housing and foreclosure problems in the U.S.?" Here’s a transcript of Romney’s extended answer: "As to what to do for the housing industry specifically, and are there things you can do to encourage housing? One is, don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom. Allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up, and let it turn around and come back up. The Obama administration has slow-walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang. Number two, the credit (that) was given to first-time homebuyers was insufficient and inadequate to turn around the housing market. I think it was an ineffective idea. It was a little bit like the cash-for-clunkers program, throwing government money at something which was not market oriented, did not staunch the decline in home values anymore than it encouraged the auto industry to take off. I think the idea of helping people refinance homes to stay in them is one that's worth further consideration. But I'm not signing on until I find out who's going to pay and who’s going to get bailed out, and that's not something which we know all the answers to." We also reviewed Romney's economic plan, "Believe in America: Mitt Romney’s plan for Jobs and Economic Growth," but it has only passing mentions of the housing sector. It emphasizes low tax rates, reduced regulations for business, initiatives for the energy sector and measures that would reduce the influence of organized labor. In the interview with the newspaper, Romney expressed some hesitation about too much government intervention in the housing market. But he did indicate he was open to the idea of helping homeowners refinance through some government action to encourage it. Our ruling Harris quoted Romney as saying the housing market should be allowed to "hit the bottom" so the crisis could "run its course." He did say that, but he also said that when new investors come in and rehab homes, the market could then "turn around and come back up." Romney also suggested he’d be open to refinancing options that would help some homeowners stay in their homes. That’s important context omitted from Harris’ speech. We rate her statement Half True.

pomt-14985	"We are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-people-are-getting-prison-sent/	Marijuana came up a number of times during the first Democratic debate on Oct. 14, 2015 -- in some cases when candidates were asked whether they had used the stuff, and at other times in the context of criminal justice policy. A reader asked us to check one claim by Sen. Bernie Sanders related to marijuana. Late in the debate, Sanders was asked whether he had a position on a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana in Nevada, the state where the debate was being held. If he were a Nevada resident, Sanders said, "I suspect I would vote yes. And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for nonviolent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs." A moment later, Sanders’ rival for the nomination, Hillary Clinton, provided rhetorical support for Sanders’ claim, saying, "I agree completely with the idea that we have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana." But is it true that, as Sanders put it, the United States is "imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana"? We decided to take a closer look. Prisoner data What the figures show is that possession itself isn’t usually enough to land someone in jail. Rather, those sentenced to prison for marijuana offenses were typically found to be committing crimes more serious than just possessing marijuana (or "smoking" it, as Sanders put it). Often, this means selling it or trafficking it. The Justice Department estimated that 3.6 percent of state inmates in 2013 had drug possession as their most serious offense. That includes possession charges for all drugs, not just marijuana. To gauge the marijuana-only percentage, we have to go back to data that’s about a decade old. The Justice Department periodically carries out surveys of inmates in state and federal correctional facilities, the last of which was from 2004. According to this study, only about three-tenths of 1 percent of state prison inmates were there because of marijuana possession alone, without a more serious charge. Meanwhile, the statistics for federal inmates paint a similar picture. The data shows that among the roughly 67,600 offenders sentenced to prison in federal criminal cases between Oct. 1, 2011 and Sept. 30, 2012, only 28 of them were incarcerated on drug-possession charges alone -- roughly four one-hundredths of 1 percent of all incarcerations. And that includes all drugs, not just marijuana. Looked at another way, the same report found that 99.9 percent of those sentenced to federal prison for any drug-related crime during that year-long period were sent to prison for something more serious than simple possession. Drug policy experts we contacted agree that imprisonment for marijuana possession by itself is rare. "He’s wrong," said Jonathan P. Caulkins, a public policy professor and drug-policy specialist at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. "Basically no one goes to prison just because they use marijuana. The vast majority of time, the people who are in jail for marijuana possession also have other things that are part of their record." Nancy G. La Vigne, director of the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, agreed. "Very, very few people are incarcerated for low quantities of marijuana possession," she said. And Allen St. Pierre -- executive director of the pro-marijuana-legalization group NORML -- concurs, calling Sanders’ claim "a tad off." NORML and other groups have estimated that there are 50,000 to 110,000 cannabis-only offenders are in prison in the United States -- yet "most, but not all, of those incarcerated on marijuana charges are there for cultivation, sales or trafficking," he said. Some caveats All this said, we should note a few points. Experts say different jurisdictions may have divergent standards and thresholds in charging defendants for marijuana possession. Some states even consider passing around a joint at a party to be considered "distributing," said Douglas Berman, an Ohio State University law professor. In addition, the statistics we cited above do not include people sent temporarily to jail -- potentially a much larger population than those serving sentences prison. The jail population could include people who have violated probation for testing positive for marijuana, or for failing to pay a fine for marijuana possession, said Bill Piper, the director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance. Marijuana arrests As it happens, Sanders might have been on safer ground had he stuck to citing arrests for marijuana possession rather than prison time. St. Pierre said that the most recent FBI data shows that of the roughly 700,000 arrests for marijuana-related charges in 2014, about 90 percent were for possession only -- and these arrests can have radiating consequences. Even spending a night or two in jail for marijuana possession can cause "tremendous disruption to their lives -- they can lose their jobs when they don’t show up for work the next day, or they can miss critical doctor appointments, or they can’t pick up their kids from school," Piper said. "This is regardless of whatever penalty they get, and even if the charges are ultimately dropped." La Vigne added that the high arrest rates for marijuana possession has other negative consequences, such as racial disparities in exposure to the criminal justice system. Indeed, when we checked with Sanders’ staff, spokesman Warren Gunnels cited a news report of the FBI arrest statistics. As for prison time, he said that even if the numbers of people in prison for marijuana possession are relatively small, it’s still more than "the number of senior executives on Wall Street who went to jail for the near collapse of the economy in 2008" -- which is the comparison Sanders made during the debate. Our ruling Sanders said, "We are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana." Being sentenced to prison for marijuana possession by itself can happen -- but it’s exceedingly rare. Sanders would have been on safer ground had he kept to pointing out continuing high levels of arrests for marijuana possession. These can result in a night in jail and a cascade of problems for those who are arrested, but getting a prison sentence for just smoking a joint is extremely unusual. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10101	If parents "don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have (for their children), they will be fined."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/26/john-mccain/fines-are-possible-but-for-uninsured/	In an appearance on Meet the Press with a little more than a week to go before Election Day, John McCain criticized Barack Obama's health plan as too burdensome to many Americans. "I think that we cannot fine small business people ... small business people who have employees without health insurance, that he's going to fine them if they don't have the insurance policy that Senator Obama wants them to have, that if they have children that don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have, they will be fined," McCain said. We've previously checked McCain's statement that Obama wants to fine small businesses that don't participate in his health plan and found it False . Now we'll look at the statement that "if they have children that don't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have, they will be fined." Obama's health plan does have a mandate that children have insurance, and it would likely include an eventual fine once all the elements of the health plan are in place. Here's how Obama explained it in an interview with the Indianapolis Recorder published Oct. 24, 2008: "We would not impose a penalty until we’ve ensured the (State Children's Health Insurance Program) and other programs have made it absolutely affordable for every child to be covered. My belief is that you’ve got to make sure people have an option before you start fining them. Once we’ve got the options in place, we’d impose a fine in the ballpark of what it’d cost to provide insurance for their child. ... Children are relatively cheap to insure. We’re going to be providing subsidies to make sure people can afford them, but we’re also going to expect our parents are showing some responsibility in signing up their kids." So McCain is right about a possible fine, even if he doesn't mention that it would not be imposed until after the program is in place. We have a bigger problem with McCain's explanation that people get fined if their children "d on't have health insurance that Senator Obama wants them to have." Actually, the fine is if the children are uninsured, not if they are insured under a certain type of plan. Obama wants all children to be insured, but he leaves many options through which this could occur. One of the central premises of Obama's plan is that people who are currently insured keep the insurance they have. So we find McCain is correct to say that the parents of children could face fines, but he is wrong to imply that it's the type of coverage that matters. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-01486	Countries with a higher minimum wage than the United States’ $7.25 an hour include Denmark at $21, Australia at $15.81, Germany at $11 and France at $12.35.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/26/facebook-posts/do-other-countries-have-higher-minimum-wage-united/	One of the most popular Democratic talking points this campaign season has been to call for an increase in the minimum wage. A social-media meme that’s been circulating recently provides a justification for hiking the minimum wage -- namely that the minimum wage in the United States falls well below that of other advanced industrialized nations. Here’s the text on the meme, which Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., among others, put on his Facebook feed: "Minimum wages around the world in U.S. dollars: Denmark $21/hr., Australia $15.81/hr., Germany $11/hr., France $12.35/hr. United States $7.25/hr. Share if you agree we should catch up with the rest of the world." We wondered how accurate the meme was, so we took a look. Using foreign-exchange rates There are two major methods for comparing minimum wages between countries. The meme uses the most basic way -- using exchange rates to convert the wage amount from the foreign country’s currency to U.S. dollars. Using this method, the meme isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty close. Australia’s minimum wage was recently raised to 16.87 per hour in Australian dollars. At current exchange rates, that’s $14.81 in U.S. dollars -- a little lower than the $15.81 cited in the meme, but still well above the United States’ rate of $7.25 an hour. Germany recently established a national minimum wage for the first time, at 8.5 Euros per hour. (Previously, Germany had a patchwork of different rates.) That works out to $10.79 in U.S. dollars, not far from the $11 cited in the meme, and still quite a bit higher than the minimum wage in the United States. In France, the minimum wage is currently 9.53 Euros, which works out to $12.10. That’s pretty close to the $12.35 in the meme, and it’s well above the U.S. minimum wage. Of the four countries cited in the meme, the description of Denmark is the least accurate. There is actually no minimum wage in Denmark, according to a summary published by the U.S. State Department. According to that summary, "unions and employer associations negotiate minimum wages. The average minimum wage for all private and public sector collective bargaining agreements was approximately DKK 110 ($20) per hour, exclusive of pension benefits." In other words, the Danish "minimum wage" of $20 or $21 is actually an average of all minimum wages across a variety of sectors. That means many Danish workers will be working in companies or industries that have a "minimum wage" lower than $20 or $21. And that undercuts the notion of a "minimum wage," which is supposed to be a floor for wages. So, using foreign-exchange rates, the meme is pretty close for Australia, France and Germany, and somewhat misleading on Denmark. But that’s not the only method you can use. Using purchasing power parity Taking exchange rates into account takes care of one problem related to comparing one country’s minimum wage to another. Untouched, though, is the difference in the cost of living between one country and the other. This difference can be handled by using what’s called "purchasing power parity," or "PPP." If there’s a higher wage but also a higher cost of living in a given country, factoring in purchasing power parity will adjust for that. In two of the four countries -- Australia and France -- factoring in purchasing power parity reduces the gap between the United States’ minimum wage and that of the other country. (We could not find equivalent data for Denmark or Germany.) The data comes from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research group for advanced industrialized countries. OECD reports that in Australia, the PPP-adjusted minimum wage is $10.20, rather than the $15.81 shown in the meme. Meanwhile, France’s PPP-adjusted minimum wage works out to $10.60, rather than $12.35 as in the meme. That’s a 36 percent reduction in the figure for Australia and a 14 percent reduction for France. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, says a PPP-adjusted wage is preferable for this sort of comparison. "Most economists agree that the PPP exchange rate offers a better measure of the standard-of-living comparison between countries than does the commercial exchange rate," he said. "Also, PPP exchange rates fluctuate less from year to year than commercial exchange rates." Our ruling The meme says that countries with a higher minimum wage than the United States’ $7.25 an hour include Denmark at $21, Australia at $15.81, Germany at $11 and France at $12.35. The figure for Denmark is questionable because the country has no single minimum wage. Meanwhile, the figures for the four other countries have been converted into U.S. dollars, but they do not take into account differences in the cost of living in each country -- in other words, how far that wage would go in purchasing goods and services. Economists tend to favor taking purchasing power into account when doing cross-country comparisons of this sort. When purchasing power is taken into account, the gap between the other countries and the United States narrows, though it does not disappear. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-01358	"Ninety-five percent of Oregonians now have health insurance coverage, tens of thousands for the very first time."	true	/oregon/statements/2014/oct/20/john-kitzhaber/do-95-percent-oregonians-now-have-health-insurance/	The rollout of Cover Oregon -- the state’s health insurance marketplace -- could hardly have been messier. Cost overruns, a famously dysfunctional website and, now, litigation, left the entire effort somewhere between comedy and tragedy. But that didn’t stop Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber, during a recent televised debate with Republican challenger Rep. Dennis Richardson, from claiming that health care in Oregon has never been more successful in terms of the number of people covered. The claim: Kitzhaber said the state will have an operating website for new insurance sign-ups within weeks. He added: "Ninety-five percent of Oregonians now have health insurance coverage, tens of thousands of them for the very first time." Do that many Oregonians now have health insurance? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We contacted Kitzhaber’s campaign and received an email back from spokeswoman Amy Wojcicki. She provided links to three news stories, all on the release in September of a report produced by Oregon Health & Science University. All three cited the report’s finding that "an estimated" 95 percent of Oregon residents now have health coverage (up from 86 percent one year ago). Wanting to check the original source, we contacted the report’s author, OHSU health economist Peter Graven. He explained that the insurance numbers in the report came directly from state enrollment reporting. "Oregon is one of only a few states that collect health insurance enrollment information from its insurers," according to the report. "These data sources make it possible to implement this approach with a greater degree of confidence than would otherwise be possible." The biggest driver in reducing the number of uninsured people in Oregon, he said, was the large expansion of Medicaid that was key to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. That expansion, all paid for by the federal government, saw participation in the Oregon Health Plan increase by more than 360,000 individuals, or 59 percent, Graven said. The state, though, deserves credit for both reaching out to eligible populations and obtaining a waiver from the federal government to use a "fast track" process to automatically enroll eligible individuals and families, he said. "Oregon pursued those options very aggressively," Graven said. "Other states didn’t do that." Cover Oregon, forced to sign people up manually, made a far smaller dent in the number of uninsured, he said. Using an extended open enrollment period and relying on insurance agents and community partners, Cover Oregon allowed nearly 80,000 people to find insurance through the marketplace. Of those, about 80 percent received tax credits based on their incomes. The estimated 550,000 Oregon residents who had no health insurance in June 2013 dropped to 201,794 one year later, Graven said. The number who gained insurance was offset somewhat by people who lost insurance offered through small- and large-group plans, Graven said. In some of those instances, employers eliminated company-offered health care, leaving people to seek other insurance options on their own. Of the 3.9 million residents living in the state in June 2013, 14 percent had no health insurance, he said. That number dropped by June 2014. "We’ve never seen a nine-point drop in the overall population of uninsured," Graven said. "We used to get really excited about two-point drops. This blows that out of the water." The ruling: Kitzhaber, trying in a debate to put the Cover Oregon debacle in the best light, claimed that 95 percent of Oregon residents have health insurance coverage, many for the first time. The author of the report that produced the number said its accuracy is bolstered by regulations that make Oregon one of a few states allowed to collect comprehensive health insurance enrollment information directly from insurers. None of those insurers has questioned the validity of the report’s numbers, including the 95 percent figure. The claim is healthy enough to be rated True.

pomt-08543	Says Scott Bruun "still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/02/kurt-schrader/kurt-schrader-says-scott-bruun-wants-privatize-soc/	As sure as the sun rises each morning and more people ease into retirement, the future of Social Security becomes a boiling issue every election. It’s happening again in the race for Oregon’s 5th congressional district. Incumbent Democrat Kurt Schrader has claimed that Republican Scott Bruun advocates ``privatizing Social Security.’’ It happened most recently during a Sept. 10 debate at the Salem City Clubwhen Schrader said this: `` ... My opponent apparently still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize social security.’’ It’s a combustible allegation that could lead some voters to believe they would be at the mercy of an unpredictable stock market as they step into retirement. Many voters, especially older ones who rely on Social Security and who vote in high numbers, would not be pleased if they thought their cherished safety net was going to be less of a sure thing. Schrader is just one of a big number of mostly Democratic candidates talking about Social Security and suggesting Republicans would leave seniors stranded. But is his claim accurate? First, a little background is needed. Social Security is a retirement and disability program guaranteed and fully funded by the U.S. government. That means if you qualify for benefits, the check will be delivered without fail each month just as it’s been since 1935 when Social Security was created by Congress. It’s an enormously popular program that currently provides benefits to 53.4 million people. But it has a huge budget and it’s only getting more expensive as the population ages, a larger number of people qualify for benefits and fewer workers are left to shoulder the cost. Here’s how AARP summarizes the dilemma: ``The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the reserve fund and payroll taxes will cover full payment of benefits through 2037.’’ That’s why Congress and politicians periodically float suggestions for saving Social Security. In 2005, President George W. Bush devoted a portion of his State of the Union address to a plan that would allow workers under age 55 the option of diverting up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into personal accounts. He argued that private investing could bring better returns while easing some of the fiscal pressure on Social Security. The proposal died as most Democrats opposed it, as did some Republicans. Critics said that unscrupulous financial advisers would charge huge fees and that the stock market’s unpredictability could strand millions of seniors without the retirement nest egg they’d counted on. And that brings us to 2010 and Schrader vs. Bruun. Schrader’s claim is based on comments Bruun has made over the years, including an Oct. 22, 1996, letter to the editor published in The Oregonian. ``We can address this problem by growing the economy and by slowly converting contributions into private investments, which will earn a much higher rate of return," he wrote then. Today, he takes a bit less muscular and more nuanced view. In the section of his campaign website devoted to issues, Bruun flatly states he does ``not support a complete privatization of Social Security.’’ At the same time, he would allow workers ``the option to invest a portion’’ of their payroll taxes in private accounts. That is essentially the same idea that crashed and burned in 2006. ``I am committed to pursuing bipartisan solutions to this challenge, and I am eager to look at any proposal that will protect Social Security benefits for today’s seniors without increasing taxes. I do not support a complete privatization of Social Security for younger workers, but I do believe that option to invest a portion of their payroll taxes to conservatively managed private equity accounts should be a choice available to future recipients of Social Security benefits,’’ Bruun says on his website. So what about Schrader’s claim that Bruun "apparently still believes in the same old direction that George Bush had before, which is to privatize Social Security"? Bruun does seem to be suggesting an approach similar to Bush’s in that he would allow younger workers to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds monitored by the government. But that's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security, which Bruun has said he does not support. If he follows Bush, Bruun would change nothing for workers 55 and older. They would not be able to opt into a personal account. And for younger workers (under 55 in Bush’s plan), the possibility of creating a personal retirement account would be totally optional -- one could choose to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as promised. Bruun’s spokeswoman Alee Lockman says Bruun has not suggested a specific age limit for workers who want to contribute to private funds. He says only ``younger workers.’ It’s beyond dispute that, if he’s elected to Congress, Bruun would vote to partially privatize Social Security. But Schrader exaggerates, suggesting that Bruun wants to fully privatize the system. That’s simply not the case and it’s the reason we rate his claim Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-12374	Clean energy employs "more than half a million Californians. That’s nearly ten times more the number of coal mining jobs that exist in the entire nation."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/jun/02/kevin-de-leon/does-california-have-10-times-many-clean-energy-jo/	Democrats in California vowed to take on greater leadership on climate change this week after President Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord. The day before Trump’s action, State Senate Leader Kevin de León, a Democrat from Los Angeles, said California should sprint ahead on aggressive renewable energy goals not only to fight climate change but because it makes economic sense. "We have already seen the economic benefits," of clean energy policies, De León told his colleagues on the Senate floor on May 31, 2017. "Today, California is home to over 100,000 solar jobs." He made his comments as he promoted a plan to require California produce all of its energy from renewable sources by 2045. De León then made a related claim that caught our attention: "Clean energy is in fact a pillar of our economy that employs now more than half a million Californians. That’s nearly ten times more the number of coal mining jobs that exist in the entire nation. So, clean energy is the future." De León makes his claim at about the 2:30 minute mark in the video above. We know California is home to many jobs tied to solar, wind and other renewable forms of energy. But do those really amount to nearly ten times the number of coal mining jobs nationwide? We dug in on a fact check. Coal mining jobs We’ll start by examining the number of coal mining jobs. As of May 2017, there were 51,000 coal mining jobs nationwide, according to an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This includes all categories of workers in the industry, from clerks and accountants to truck drivers and security guards. The number of extraction workers -- those who actually mine the coal -- was far smaller, at 11,620, according to 2016 breakdown of these jobs by the Bureau. In the mid 1980s, there were nearly 180,000 coal mining jobs in the United States. The industry has experienced a steady decline in employment since that time, with a few exceptions. De León appears to be on the right track with his claim that California’s half million clean energy jobs are nearly ten times the nation’s 51,000 coal mining jobs. Clean energy jobs Verifying the number of clean energy jobs in California is more complex. "There isn’t a formal way the state collects data on clean energy jobs, at least not at this point," said Brook Taylor, deputy director of the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development. Instead, Taylor said, the state relies on a survey by Advanced Energy Economy Institute, which is affiliated with a national association that promotes clean and affordable energy. He said the organization takes a deep look at California’s "advanced energy" jobs, which Taylor described as an interchangeable term for clean energy employment. As of 2015, AEEI’s survey found 507,703 advanced energy jobs in California, up 18 percent from the previous year. It estimated that figure would grow to nearly 550,000 in 2016. AEEI said it based its data on a survey of 831 companies doing business in California. It defines advanced energy employees are those who are full-time and part-time permanent employees who support the advanced energy portion of a business, including administrative staff and excluding interns and other temporary workers. De León's spokesman pointed to this survey as evidence for the senator’s claim. ‘Really elusive number’ Labor economists, however, say the AEE survey isn’t perfect. "This is a really elusive number," Carol Zabin, director of the Green Economy Program at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, said of the number of clean energy jobs in the state. "The study he cited by AEE, it may be an exaggeration. But we don’t have anything better." Zabin said the way clean energy jobs are counted is problematic. An electrician whose company starts installing more efficient lighting, she explained, might be counted as having a clean energy job. A bus driver who operates a diesel bus one year and then a cleaner burning bus the next might similarly be counted in the survey as having a clean energy job. But those aren’t new jobs, they are the "greening of jobs," she added. The survey also might count employees who spend only part of their time performing clean energy tasks as clean energy workers, added Betony Jones, associate director at the university’s Green Economy Program. De León's statement does not specifically address whether these are new jobs or existing positions that have shifted to clean energy roles. The senator’s spokesman also pointed to a 2017 U.S. Energy and Employment report that at least partly backs up the claim. That report cites just over 300,000 energy efficiency jobs in the state. In addition, the report includes 200,000 electric power generation jobs, of which about 153,000 belong to the solar industry and about 4,600 in wind. This approaches the half million jobs De Leon cited, though many of them would be subject to the same caveats expressed by the labor economists. Our rating State Senator Kevin de León recently stated that California has "more than half a million" clean energy jobs. "That’s nearly ten times more the number of coal mining jobs that exist in the entire nation." Government data and a survey by the Advanced Energy Economy Institute, which is affiliated with a clean energy trade group, largely back up De León's claim. Labor economists say pinpointing the exact number of clean energy jobs in any state is difficult. There aren’t always clear definitions for these jobs. And the way some clean energy jobs are counted is problematic, they said, because some positions only focus on clean energy as a portion of their overall responsibilties. Still, they said, the evidence cited by the senator is the best available. We found De León's statement is accurate but needs clarification.

pomt-13823	Says Mark Kirk "called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans" and "was apparently fine with Trump’s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation."	false	/illinois/statements/2016/jul/15/tammy-duckworth/says-mark-kirk-called-mass-arrest-18000-african-am/	In the hotly contested Illinois U.S. Senate race, Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth is doing everything she can to link Republican incumbent Mark Kirk to Donald Trump. Even after Kirk said he would not support Trump on June 7, the Duckworth camp kept at it in this tweet: That's a packed tweet. Is it true that Kirk called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans and, second, that Kirk had no objection to Trump’s call for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants? We checked the record. What Kirk said Duckworth's deputy campaign manager Matt McGrath said in an email she was referencing a statement Kirk made in May 2013 during an interview with Fox 32 Chicago political editor Mike Flannery. Kirk told Flannery: "My top priority is to arrest the Gangster Disciple gang, which is 18,000 people. I would like to do a mass pickup of them and put them all in the Thomson Correctional Facility. I will be proposing this to the assembled federal law enforcement: ATF, DEA and FBI." Kirk made that statement in response to the January 2013 shooting death of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who was struck in the back by a stray bullet during a gang-related shooting on Chicago’s south side. The Gangster Disciples is an African-American gang from the city's south side and has an estimated 18,000 members, though its membership could be as high as 30,000, according to the Chicago Crime Commission’s press officer John Pastuovic. The statement drew criticism from the media as well as from Kirk’s colleagues in Congress, including U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill, who called the proposal an "upper middle class elitist white boy solution to a problem he knows nothing about." But Kirk acknowledged in July 2013 that his plan to arrest every member of the Gangster Disciples was "not actually that practical." Still, not only does Duckworth's tweet take what Kirk said out of context, it also implies he supported the general mass arrest of 18,000 African-Americans, even though Kirk never mentioned race or used the term "African-Americans" during his interview with Fox 32 Chicago. What about Kirk on deportation? And as for Duckworth’s claim that Kirk "was apparently fine with Trump’s call for mass deportation?" On May 4, Trump appeared on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt, where he reiterated his plan to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants if he were to become president. In a May 6 interview with CNN before Trump’s primary-clinching win in Indiana, Kirk said he would support Trump as the Republican nominee, calling Trump’s candidacy a "net benefit" for his own campaign in Illinois. Kirk withdrew his support for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee on June 7 after Trump said an American-born federal judge of Mexican ancestry couldn’t preside fairly over civil fraud lawsuits against the defunct Trump University because he has called for a wall to be built along the U.S.-Mexico border. While Kirk did back Trump knowing his position on illegal immigration, Kirk has made clear in the past he does not support Trump’s controversial immigration policies. In July 2015, Kirk told reporters at news conference he had a message for Trump: "In a typical Chicago way, to my Mexican-American friends, I would say, 'Donald Trump callate' shut up." And Kirk’s congressional voting record suggests he would not be "fine" with deporting 11 million immigrants living here illegally. Eleni Demertzis, the Kirk campaign’s communications director, noted in an email the senator supported and voted for the high-profile comprehensive immigration reform package in June 2013, which first would have secured the border and then created a tough but fair pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, among other things. But that measure never made it to a vote in the House. In addition to his pro-immigration reform stance, Kirk in October 2015 broke ranks with his party and was the only GOP Senator who voted to preserve federal funding for "sanctuary cities." However, Kirk did vote in favor of increasing penalties from two years to five years for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country illegally after being deported, denied entry or removed for other reasons, voting largely along party lines. Our ruling Duckworth tweeted: "Kirk, who called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans, was apparently fine with Trump’s #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation." While Kirk did call for the mass arrest of the Gangster Disciples, an African-American gang estimated to have 18,000 members, Duckworth’s tweet takes Kirk’s statement out of context and gives the impression he had called for the general mass incarceration of 18,000 African-Americans. Duckworth also fails to acknowledge Kirk walked back his statement shortly after he made it. More importantly, Kirk did not mention race when he originally called for a "mass pickup" of the Gangster Disciples gang. As for Kirk being "apparently fine" with mass deportation, his congressional voting record on immigration shows he supports comprehensive reform that would both improve border security and implement a tough, but fair pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants -- not to mention he was the lone Republican senator to vote against legislation that would have withheld federal funds from sanctuary cities.

It's not an emolument."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/13/sheri-dillon/trump-lawyer-foreign-dignitaries-staying-trump-hot/	Here’s a hypothetical scenario giving some ethics watchdogs heartburn: A foreign dignitary visits Washington, D.C., on government business and decides to stay at the Trump International Hotel. He or she might choose to stay there because of its amenities, its convenient location four blocks from the White House, or to build up goodwill with the president who owns the hotel. If his hotel accepts the foreign government’s bill payment for the dignitary’s stay, some critics argue Donald Trump would, as president, be in violation of the Constitution’s provision to block foreign influence. The emoluments clause says that no officer of the United States can accept gifts, titles or emoluments (salary) from a foreign government, without permission from Congress. But lawyers for Trump say that the critics are mistaken, because this clause doesn’t apply to fair-value exchanges, such as paying standard market rates for a hotel room. "These people are wrong," said Morgan Lewis & Bockius partner Sheri Dillon at a Jan. 11 press conference. "This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument." Despite this position, Dillon said Trump’s company would donate to the U.S. Treasury any profits earned from foreign governments through his business, to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. And his company will also refrain from engaging in any new deals with foreign governments while Trump is president. But given the backlash about Dillon’s interpretation of the emoluments clause from some legal commentators, we decided to fact-check her claim that fair-value exchanges — like paying a hotel bill — are not emoluments. The answer we found isn’t very satisfying: Some legal scholars say Dillon has a point, others say she doesn’t. The emoluments clause hasn’t come before the courts in any meaningful way, so there aren’t any past judicial rulings to look at for guidance about the scope of the emoluments clause. Whether the clause even applies to the president remains an unsettled legal question. "Anything anyone tells you about the emoluments clause is a matter of opinion," said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause. Before we go any further, here’s the full text of the emoluments clause, found in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution: "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." What that means is someone holding a government position cannot take an emolument, meaning payment or salary, from a foreign government. A clear example of an emolument would be if a government employee made a decision favorable to a foreign country and, in exchange, a representative of that country’s government gave the American employee a check. Dillon’s law firm explained in a Jan. 10 white paper why they believe this clause doesn’t ban, say, a foreign government paying a fair rate to stay in a hotel owned by a government worker. The authors of the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper wrote that the Constitution’s authors understood the term "emoluments" to mean "a payment or other benefit received as a consequence of discharging the duties of an office." So paying a hotel to offer standard hotel services is not an emolument because the service provided is not associated with the office of a president. They also wrote that in the early 1800s, the country nearly amended the Constitution to extend the emoluments clause to all citizens, not just federal office holders. They did not see evidence that anyone thought that extending the clause’s reach would inhibit citizens’ ability to engage in fair commerce with foreign governments or their representatives. Tillman said he largely agrees with the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper — especially because the money would be flowing into the Trump Organization, not Trump’s pockets directly. "The concern is related to the concept of office," he said. "It’s not about business deals like staying in hotels when the price is fixed." That, however, is far from the final word. Several legal scholars wrote in a Brookings memo that they read the emoluments clause as applying to fair-value exchanges. The clause is intended to block any arrangement with a foreign state that could result in a profit or benefit for the officeholder because it carries the risk of "improper foreign influence," as the officeholder’s legitimate business interests would depend, at least in part, on the foreign state, the authors wrote. They are Norman L. Eisen, chief White House ethics lawyer under Barack Obama, Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, and Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard University. The historical evidence shows, they argue, that the drafters of the Constitution wanted the emoluments clause to be broad in scope, in order to limit even the possibility of corruption. For example, the phrasing in the clause specifically refers to emoluments "of any kind whatever." "Wholly apart from any actual quid pro quo arrangements or demonstrable bribes or payoffs, the emoluments clause will be violated whenever a foreign diplomat stays in a Trump hotel or hosts a reception in one," they wrote. Despite their position, Eisen, Painter and Tribe note that "there is not yet a firm consensus on this point." All of this discussion assumes that Trump, as president, would be subject to the emoluments clause. But that’s still not a certainty, and there is evidence, both modern and from the time of the Constitution’s ratification, that supports either side. We should note that hotel stays are not the only way representatives of foreign states interact with Trump’s business. He has worked with foreign governments to do business in around 20 countries. The Bank of China is a tenant in Trump Tower in Manhattan. Depending on how his plans to separate himself from his business play out, these dealings could present, if not a violation of the emoluments clause, a serious conflict of interest. Our ruling Dillon, a lawyer for Trump, said under the Constitution, "Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument." Whether the emoluments clause would include a situation where representatives of a foreign state paid for a room in one of Trump’s hotels is an unanswered legal question. We encountered reasonable arguments on both sides, and there isn’t any judicial precedent to guide us to the right answer. Maybe this question will get answered in a meaningful way during the Trump administration. But for now, we rate the statement Half True.

pomt-12490	"President Trump has passed more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/may/01/tom-mcclintock/mcclintock-trump-signed-more-laws-first-100-days-a/	California Republican Congressman Tom McClintock gave President Trump high marks for his initial performance in the White House, especially when it comes to the number of bills he’s signed into law. "President Trump has passed more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman," McClintock claimed in an interview on Sacramento’s KFBK radio station on April 28, 2017, one day before Trump’s 100th day in office. McClintock’s district includes the suburbs east of Sacramento and large stretches of the Sierra Nevada. The congressman’s claim echoed a statement by White House press secretary Sean Spicer just a few days earlier. "Despite the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats, he's worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman, and these bills deliver on some of his most significant promises to the American people," Spicer said at the White House daily press briefing April 25. The national PolitiFact team has already examined Spicer’s claim. We’ll use their analysis to rate McClintock. Trump most productive? In a related fact-check in April 2017, PolitiFact rated as False Trump’s claim that no administration had accomplished as much as he did, period. It found Trump has had some achievements in office, but at the very least, they are much less numerous and far-reaching than those of President Roosevelt, the standard against whom all presidents are measured. In more recent years, other presidents, including Obama, have accomplished more in their first 100 days than Trump has, historians told PolitiFact. Looking at the number of bills, Trump had signed 28 as of late April 2017, just before his 100 day mark in office. Spicer and McClintock are correct that this is more than every president going back about 70 years. Trump signed 31 executive orders during his first 100 days, also more than any president since Truman, according to calculations in a CNN.com article. Many of those rolled back orders signed by President Obama. "Those mean something to certain groups, but they don't have the kind of broad impact that legislation has, that programs that are approved by Congress have, because the fact that they can be rescinded by a stroke of a president's pen means they can be reimplemented with the stroke of another president’s pen," H.W. Brands, a professor of history at the University of Texas, who has written biographies of Woodrow Wilson, Andrew Jackson, and Benjamin Franklin, told Vox.com in a recent interview. "Furthermore, they don't have legitimacy, the credibility, of having the approval of more than just one person. If you get major legislation passed, it has the approval of Congress and the presidency, and that means a whole lot more than if it's just the preference of a president." Still, the bill signing measurement isn’t perfect either. That's primarily because not all bills are created equal. None of the bills Trump has signed into law are particularly significant or include any of his major campaign promises. The numbers Truman signed 55 bills in his first 100 days after his 1948 election. (Truman first became president in 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in office. So we’re starting with the first 100 days of Truman’s first full term.) No president since Truman has signed as many bills in his first 100 days, according to data from GovTrack and research by political scientists John Frendreis, Raymond Tatalovich and Jon Schaff. The next highest after Trump, who has signed 28 bills, was John F. Kennedy, who signed 26. The lowest was George W. Bush, who signed seven. No president comes close to Roosevelt, who began the tradition of marking the first 100 days. He signed 76. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Note on the chart: For presidents Jimmy Carter through Trump, we did our own count using GovTrack. For earlier presidents, we used data confirmed by Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University Chicago. For Lyndon Johnson and Truman, who both came into office to replace a president midterm, we used the first 100 days after their re-election. We left out Gerald Ford because he did not serve a full term. Of the post-Truman presidents, Trump is "fairly typical" in terms of the number of bills signed so far, Frendreis said. The bills Spicer says that Trump has shepherded these bills through Congress. However, the 28 bills aren’t very significant and don’t appear to have required vote whipping from the White House. For example, three bills appoint individuals to the Smithsonian Institution board, two name buildings, and one designates a location for a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial. Trump worked directly with members of Congress to repeal Obamacare but failed to convince enough to end the federal healthcare law during his first 100 days. The most notable bills Trump has signed are a set of 13 that reverse Obama-era regulations on a range of issues including on internet privacy and gun control. While that was a goal for Republican lawmakers, it’s important to note these bills made it to Trump’s desk through a process made possible by the Congressional Review Act, which became law in 1996. The act gives Congress a narrow window to reverse regulations, so these 13 bills had to get through Congress within Trump’s first 100 days. Notably missing from the list of 28 bills that have reached his desk: A bill repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, along with several other laws Trump said he would usher through Congress within his first 100 days. Compare this to President Barack Obama, who signed 14 laws, but those laws included the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the $800 billion stimulus package. Or Roosevelt, who within 100 days signed 15 major bills including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed bills that legalized the manufacture and sale of beer and wine and established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Generally speaking, it’s rare for a president to sign major legislation in his first 100 days, Frendreis said. "Outsider" presidents like Trump, in particular, need time to learn how to navigate the lawmaking process in Washington, and major legislation doesn’t move through Congress quickly. The first 100 days is "not necessarily an accurate reflection of how effective a president is going to be in leading Congress," he said. Our ruling White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump has "worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman." California Republican Congressman Tom McClintock made a similar claim about Trump passing more legislation than any president since Truman. In the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills. The president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28. The national PoltiFact rated Spicer’s claim Mostly True, with the key clarification that none of the bills Trump has signed so far are major pieces of legislation. They added that his accomplishment doesn’t indicate that Trump has been particularly skilled at getting his agenda through Congress so far. For the same reasons, and with the same key clarification, we rate McClintock’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-06514	"More than 25 million Americans are unemployed. More than 50 million live without health insurance. Perhaps 100 million live in poverty."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/11/occupied-wall-street-journal/are-statistics-occupied-wall-street-journal-correc/	To back up their complaints about economic injustice, protesters taking part in the demonstrations in New York's Financial District in New York have been handing out the Occupied Wall Street Journal. "Our system is broken," said an Oct. 5, 2011, article headlined "The Revolution Begins at Home: An Open Letter to Join the Wall Street Occupation," which was also posted here. "More than 25 million Americans are unemployed. More than 50 million live without health insurance. Perhaps 100 million live in poverty. Yet the fat cats are showered with billions in tax breaks while politicians compete to turn the screws on the rest of us." We wondered if the article’s numbers were accurate. We’ll take them one by one: "More than 25 million Americans are unemployed." This is nearly double the government's official number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counted almost 14 million unemployed Americans in September 2011. This is the number that’s used to calculate the official unemployment rate of 9.1 percent. But some critics have long argued that this definition of unemployment is too limiting, since it doesn’t count people who have stopped looking for work or who are working part time, even though they’d prefer a full-time job. So BLS also offers an alternative measure (known to economists as "U-6") that factors in both groups. Using this measure, BLS in September 2010 found an additional 2.5 million Americans who are "marginally attached" to the labor force, meaning they’d be ready to work if a job became available, and another 9.3 million Americans who are working part time but who would prefer a full-time job. Together, these three categories added up to 25.8 million people in September 2011, for a total "U-6" rate of 16.5 percent, or well above the official unemployment rate. That’s in line with what the article said -- but only if you consider "unemployed" to mean "unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force, or working only part-time for economic reasons." And while there are good reasons for looking at the "U-6" rate when discussing the current jobs picture, "U-6" is not the official definition of "unemployed." "More than 50 million live without health insurance." The article nailed this one just about perfectly. The most recent U.S. Census Bureau study, "Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage: 2010," found that 49.9 million Americans were uninsured in 2010, or 16.3 percent of the population. "Perhaps 100 million live in poverty." The article hedges its claim by saying "perhaps," but you still have to stretch the official definition of poverty quite a bit to make the number work. According to the same Census Bureau report -- "Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage: 2010" -- there were 46.2 million Americans below the poverty line in 2010, or 15.1 percent of the population. That's less than half the 100 million claim in the article. However, some critics have long questioned whether the official poverty line is set too low. So the Census Bureau also calculates the number of Americans whose incomes put them at various multiples of the poverty line -- people, in other words, who are poor but not officially impoverished. These numbers show that 60.4 million Americans are at 125 percent of the poverty line, 75.3 million are at 150 percent of the poverty line, and 103.6 million Americans -- or just over one-third -- are at twice the poverty line. So to get to 100 million Americans, the article would have to count people who are at roughly twice the official poverty level. Most people would agree that these people are in a low-income category. But according to official government statistics, they are not "in poverty." Our ruling The numbers in the Occupied Wall Street Journal rely on the broadest definitions of economic deprivation in America, but they are at odds with official government statistical definitions. While the number for the uninsured is essentially correct, the indicators for unemployment and poverty refer to broader, alternative measures that have some usefulness in policy discussions but that aren’t accurately described by the terminology in the article. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Occupied Wall Street Journal	None	None	None	2011-10-11T11:25:56	2011-10-05	['United_States']
pomt-09864	Health care reform legislation is “likely to mandate free ‘sex change’ surgeries.”	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/07/blog-posting/conservative-news-release-says-health-care-bill-li/	In trying to build opposition to President Barack Obama's health care proposal, critics have suggested that health care would be government-controlled , that people would be left to die if their treatment exceeded a certain cost and that it would require counseling telling people " how to end their life sooner ." (We've ruled versions of each of those False or Pants on Fire.) Now comes a new one: that taxpayers may soon be footing the bill for free sex-change operations. On Aug. 4, a news release to that effect went out under the name of Matt Barber, who is director of cultural affairs with Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group, and the associate dean of Liberty University School of Law, which was founded by the late televangelist Jerry Falwell. It was quickly spread by blogs on the left and the right. Titled, “ObamaCare Likely to Mandate Free ‘Sex Change’ Surgeries,” the release asserted that “the weight of the evidence indicates that cosmetic ‘gender reassignment’ surgeries for both U.S. citizens and illegal immigrants who suffer from [the American Psychiatric Association-] recognized ‘Gender Identity Disorder’ (GID) may also be provided – free of charge – courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. The current price tag for such a procedure can exceed $50,000.” To confirm Barber’s authorship and learn more about his reasoning, we tried to reach him through the phone number and e-mail address listed on the release, as well as through a call to a different number at Liberty Counsel. But he did not respond. Because we couldn't confirm his authorship, we're attributing this item to our generic category "bloggers," since they have spread it so widely. Before we delve into our findings in detail, here's an overview of why we found the claim was False: The news release tries to stitch together a patchwork of unrelated items to back up the sex-change claim, but the health care bills as they appear today simply don't do what the release alleges. There is no mandate for sex-change coverage. The news release offers three pieces of evidence: • An exchange between Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., about the legislation covering treatments that would be "medically necessary." • Language in the House version of the health care bill that provides for "standards, as appropriate, for the collection of accurate data on health and health care" based on "sex, sexual orientation [and] gender identity." • And language in a draft Senate bill that requires the Department of Health and Human Services to “‘develop standards for the measurement of gender’ (i.e., officially recognize subjectively self-determined "transgender" or "transsexual" gender identities). It further mandates ‘participation in the institutions’ programs of individuals and groups from ... different genders and sexual orientations.” Let’s take these assertions one by one. The Hatch-Mikulski exchange It came during a session held by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to revise a Senate version of the health care bill. The committee was discussing an amendment by Mikulski that would require health insurance plans to include preventive women's health services. Hatch asked his colleague whether that meant that coverage of abortions would be required. She replied that the measure would not “mandate” abortion coverage but would “provide for any service deemed medically necessary or medically appropriate.” The amendment narrowly passed the committee and was appended to the bill. It's worth noting that Mikulski's amendment may not survive to enactment. And her comments quoted in the news release aren’t, in and of themselves, binding. Still, the news release used Mikulski’s explanation on abortion to assert that sex-change treatments would also be covered under the same doctrine. Before we get to the substance of that claim, let’s look at the significance of Mikulski's phrase "medically necessary." Seth Chandler, the co-director of the Health Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston, said that the phrase does carry weight. “That is kind of a magic word in health insurance, in that virtually every private insurance plan I know of contains an exclusion for procedures that are not medically necessary,” he said. “It’s designed to preclude fraudulent or highly experimental procedures.” The American Medical Association, the nation’s leading doctors’ group, has already gone on record saying that gender-reassignment surgery can be medically necessary. In 2008, the AMA passed a resolution on gender identity disorder that opposes coverage limitations “when such care is based upon sound scientific evidence and sound medical opinion.” Even so, insurers have not made such coverage universal today. The Web site of the National Center for Lesbian Rights posts a fact sheet that says that such surgeries have long been banned by Medicare and CHAMPUS, the federally run military health plan. Medicaid does not specifically bar those surgeries, the fact sheet added, but some states have statutes barring them. As for the private sector, neither America’s Health Insurance Plans, the trade group for private insurers, nor the Transgender Law Center could provide us with figures on how common it is for transgender surgeries to be covered by insurance. But AHIP’s vice president of communications, Susan Pisano, said that, anecdotally, “my understanding is that there is less coverage for those procedures and treatments. … Some employers do provide it, but I don’t think most people have coverage for those services.” Indeed, the AMA resolution noted that “many health insurance plans categorically exclude coverage of mental health, medical, and surgical treatments for GID, even though many of these same treatments, such as psychotherapy, hormone therapy, breast augmentation and removal, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, orchiectomy, and salpingectomy, are often covered for other medical conditions.” Still, there is at least a nugget of plausibility in the news release citing Mikulski’s language. It may indeed make it into the final version of health reform, and if so, it could provide justification for expanding (though not necessarily mandating) coverage of procedures that are controversial but deemed medically necessary. The House and Senate language But in its other points, relating to language in the House and Senate bills, the news release offers little evidence to back up its claim. The release's discussion of the House bill's language focuses on one mention of collecting health care data based on “sex, sexual orientation [and] gender identity.” We looked up the passage, and it comes in a section that lays out the job description for a new assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for health information. That official is charged with setting standards for data collection on a number of factors, including such commonplace categories as race, sex, ethnicity, primary language and geographic setting in addition to “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” While it’s true that the section mentions gender identity, it merely addresses how health care data on a wide variety of subgroups should be collected. It is not a green light to cover sex-change surgeries. The evidence is even flimsier in the release's claim about the Senate bill’s language. The first phrase the news release cites – that a Senate draft bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to “develop standards for the measurement of gender” – would, according the release, “officially recognize subjectively self-determined ‘transgender’ or ‘transsexual’ gender identities.” We find that's a ridiculous leap of logic. The passage in question is the equivalent of the House bill’s language on data collection, not mandated coverage. The full passage cites the development of statistical standards to measure not just for gender but also for “geographic location, socioeconomic status, primary language and disability measures.” The second passage cited from the Senate bill addresses mental and behavioral health grants that may be awarded by the federal government to students. Its reference to “participation in the institutions’ programs of individuals and groups from ... different genders and sexual orientations” merely constitutes a requirement that schools receiving support under the grant program adhere to principles of nondiscrimination and diversity in “racial, ethnic, cultural, geographic, religious, linguistic, and class backgrounds” as well as for “different genders and sexual orientations.” That's simply a requirement that the participating educational institutions not discriminate — not a mandate for covering sex-change surgeries. The bottom line is that neither bill talks specifically about gender-reassignment surgery. The news release has attempted — poorly, in most cases — to piece together a patchwork case. But the health reform plans as they stand now don't do what the release claims. In theory, the House bill does offer one path by which coverage of sex-change surgeries could be made mandatory. If that part of the bill survives to enactment, a new panel called the Health Benefits Advisory Council could eventually recommend that sex-change surgeries be covered. The council, chaired by the surgeon general, would be tasked with recommending to the HHS secretary what “treatments, items and services” constitute “essential benefits.” If the HHS secretary agreed with the recommendations, they would initially take effect for public-option plans if such plans were part of the final legislation. After a five-year transitional period, private plans would have to adhere to this basic package of services. So in theory, it would be in the Health Benefits Advisory Council’s power to decide to include gender-reassignment surgery in the package of essential benefits. But that's a far cry — and many political hurdles away — from "mandating" sex-change coverage. Given the public’s squeamishness about the topic, it doesn't seem to us that it's “likely,” as the news release suggested. So let’s recap. The release may have a point that Mikulski’s comment could open the door to "medically necessary" coverage which conceivably may include sex-change operations. But it's unclear whether her amendment will remain in the legislation, and there's nothing specific in the legislation on sex-change procedures and nothing else solid that indicates such coverage will be provided. The news release cherry-picked a few fleeting references to “gender” and “sexual orientation” in completely unrelated contexts to argue that proposed health care legislation would mandate free sex-change surgeries (and allow them for illegal aliens, no less). To us, these bits of evidence are wholly unpersuasive. We find the claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2009-08-07T12:13:20	2009-08-04	['None']
pomt-04023	"Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in five years."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/02/central-falls-police-department/central-falls-ri-animal-control-says-one-male-cat-/	We love cats. They sit on your lap. They purr. They play with yarn. We tease them with laser pointers. Who knew the males of the species were lean, mean reproductive machines? That's what we learned from a Jan. 28 news release from the Central Falls Police Department that announced a $30,000 animal control grant intended to help low-income pet owners keep the cat population down through spaying and neutering. "Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in just five years," the release says. Usually, when we see a statement we'd like to check, we ask, "Is that true?" In this case we asked, "Is that even possible?" We rushed to our calculator. Five years is 1,827 days (counting leap years). The typical number of kittens in a litter is four. That means the male cat would have to find and successfully inseminate 57 females per day to create that many kittens over five years. "He would be a very busy boy," joked Central Falls police Capt. Steven Bradley, listed as the contact person on the news release, after we told him what the numbers revealed. "Maybe he's got a line on some good catnip." And steroids! So clearly the math shows the statement is wrong. Bradley said the statistic came from Rita Falaguerra of Cat Adoption Team Services, which secured the grant. Falaguerra said she stands by the statistic because it came from the state veterinarian, Peter Belinsky. Belinsky said she may have seen it as a pamphlet posted in his examination room which said 400,000 cats could come from one pair of cats over seven years under ideal conditions. "I might have quoted it, but that was a long time ago," he said, acknowledging that he was not sure if the widely-cited number was true. We found the questionable factoid (or differing versions of it) repeated on many pet-lover websites, such as the Pet Health Network, the ASPCA, and in the mainstream media. (The Journal repeated it on Jan. 29 and a day earlier on its website.) Most often, the claims involve the reproduction potential of female cats, not male. The amount of time deemed necessary varies from five to seven years, depending on who is talking. So what's the real story? Belinsky also cited a 1993 article published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Like many similar claims, it offers numbers based on raw mathematical population growth and does not factor real life into the equation. It said that if all the cats remain healthy and get enough nutrition, with no premature deaths, and each female produces eight kittens per year, it’s theoretically possible that 174,760 cats could descend from a single female after seven years. That statistic is also quoted frequently. But it assumes that females are only fertile for one year. If all the females remain fertile indefinitely, the paper says, there would be 781,250 cats after seven years. We checked the calculations. They turned out to be off. It would take eight years, not seven, to reach either number. After five years, the timeframe we're looking at, the cat population would be 2,729 if female fertility lasted one year and 6,249 if all the females remained fertile. That's a far cry -- or should we say meow -- from 420,000. Belinsky said even those lower numbers are unrealistic, especially when you're talking about cats in the wild. "You've got predation, you've got toxins, you’ve got infectious disease, and they don't live more than a year or two in the wild, so this would be under ideal conditions," Belinsky said. A more reasonable estimate for feral cats, he said, would be roughly 1.8 surviving cats for every female per year. At that rate, we calculated, you would have perhaps 49 cats alive after five years. As it turns out, the 420,000 statistic has been debunked in articles going back a few years. The Wall Street Journal shot it down in 2006. The San Francisco Chronicle did so in 2010. Where does it come from? The website HumaneWatch.org says it found the Humane Society of the United States using it in a news release in 1989. Whatever the source, the fallacious feline factoid has nine lives -- if not more -- among pet enthusiasts. "That's the craziness of all these quotes," said Belinsky. "They're not derived from actually following the animals in the wild or under a controlled experiment. They just extrapolate based on math and best guess." Our ruling Central Falls police, citing a cat adoption service, said, "Statistics show one male cat can father 420,000 kittens in five years." In the real world, that's impossible. The idea that one female cat and her succeeding generations could produce that many cats in half a decade is just as ridiculous.

pomt-05761	Says Mitt Romney said he does not "line up with the NRA."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/29/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-ad-quotes-mitt-romney-distancing-him/	Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is running a television ad that uses rival Mitt Romney’s own words against him. The ad contains no voice-over, only sound effects as Romney’s quotes pop onto the screen against a black background. The first says, "I don’t line up with the National Rifle Association." The NRA wields enormous political power at the state and national levels, and conservative candidates crave its endorsement. It’s startling to see a Republican contender distancing himself from the group, so we decided to delve into the ad’s claim. Did Romney really say that? In short, yes, he did. But it was in 1994. Running for Senate in Massachusetts, Romney criticized his opponent, Democrat Ted Kennedy, for supporting a crime bill in Congress. Romney said Kennedy had worked to expand the cost of the bill while weakening several provisions. According to a story in the Boston Globe about the issue, Romney stressed that he supported the bill's ban on 19 different types of assault weapons -- which the NRA opposed. "I don't line up with the NRA," Romney said, according to the story. The quote was not a blanket statement of disagreement with the NRA, as Santorum’s ad could suggest. Rather Romney was talking about a particular issue on which he didn't agree with the NRA's position. At the time, Romney also voiced support for the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on gun sales. The NRA opposed that bill. His words since In 2002, while running for governor, Romney was still talking the gun control talk. In a debate comment captured in this YouTube video, Romney said, "We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts. I support them. I won’t chip away at them. I believe they help protect us and provide for our safety." In fact, he expanded those protections in the state. In 2004, Gov. Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons such as the AK-47 and Uzi. The NRA called the law "ineffective and unnecessary." By 2007, when he was making his first run for president, Romney’s tone had begun to change. The Globe reported on his shift in rhetoric: "He now touts his work as governor to ease restrictions on gun owners. He proudly describes himself as a member of the NRA -- though his campaign won't say when he joined. And Friday, at his campaign's request, top officials of the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation led him around one of the country's biggest gun shows. "Romney says he still backs the ban on assault weapons, but he won't say whether he stands by the Brady Bill. And after the gun show tour, his campaign declined to say whether he would still describe himself as a supporter of tough gun laws." The Globe later reported that Romney admitted to joining the NRA in August, 2006, just months before announcing his presidential candidacy. At the time his campaign touted his pro-gun efforts as governor, including his signing of an NRA-backed bill that reduced a testing requirement on certain pistol-makers before they could sell guns in Massachusetts and his designation of May 7, 2005, as "The Right to Bear Arms Day" in Massachusetts to honor "the right of decent, law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms in defense of their families, persons, and property and for all lawful purposes, including the common defense." The best evidence we found on the matter comes from a 2007 interview Romney gave on Meet the Press. Host Tim Russert confronted Romney with his quotes from 1994 and asked him to explain. Romney said, "My position on guns is the same position I’ve had for a long, long time. That position is that I don’t line up a hundred percent with the NRA. I don’t see eye to eye with the NRA on every issue." He said he still supported banning weapons that are "unusually lethal" but hedged on waiting periods. He said the Brady Bill originally included a waiting period because the time was necessary for performing background checks. Now that technology enables instant background checks, such waiting periods are unnecessary, he said. Then he spoke a bit about Second Amendment rights. "We should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns, either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose. I support the work of the NRA, I’m a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don’t," he told Russert. The 2012 campaign Romney didn’t attend the NRA’s national convention in 2011 in Pittsburgh and instead sent a videotaped message. He said nothing about gun rights. He offered congratulations to the organization and its leaders for their work defending the Constitution and criticized political leaders who would expand the reach of government. "I believe in America. I believe in free enterprise," he said. Romney’s campaign website has a section devoted to gun rights. It does not mention the NRA or the Massachusetts ban on assault weapons he signed as governor. Instead, it touts his work on behalf of gun owners, including extending the terms of gun licenses in Massachusetts and making replacement licenses free. "As president, Mitt will work to expand and enhance access and opportunities for Americans to hunt, shoot, and protect their families, homes and property, and he will fight the battle on all fronts to protect and promote the Second Amendment," the website says. We contacted the NRA for this story but didn’t hear back. The group has not endorsed any primary candidate -- which isn’t unusual. It didn’t announce its backing of John McCain in the last election until October of 2008. But the group has made clear its goal is to defeat President Barack Obama. Christopher Cox, the NRA’s chief lobbyist told Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs in February 2012 that "any of these (Republican) candidates would be a lot better than this president. ... So we take any of them over this guy." Our ruling Santorum’s ad flashes a quote from Romney saying "I don’t line up with the National Rifle Association." The quote is accurate, though it omits the fact that Romney spoke those words 18 years ago and used them to describe his position on a single issue. Romney clearly has shifted his position on the issue of gun rights to align himself more closely with the NRA. For one thing, he became a member. And in campaigns subsequent to that 1994 senatorial bid, he has emphasized his work in favor of gun ownership rather than on tightening laws. But when Romney addressed the issue in 2007, he did not contradict what he said in 1994. "I support the work of the NRA, I’m a member of the NRA. But do we line up on every issue? No, we don’t," he told Tim Russert. What else? He signed an assault weapons ban opposed by the NRA as Massachusetts governor. We rate the statement True.

pomt-07165	"We have the highest per-pupil cost in the country."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/13/steve-oroho/sen-steve-oroho-says-new-jersey-has-nations-highes/	What’s so bad about finishing in first place? Plenty, if you’re New Jersey and per-pupil costs top those of any other state in the nation, according to State Sen. Steve Oroho (R-Dist. 24). He cited that statistic in a May 26 Star-Ledger news story about how the Legislature will fit a Supreme Court-ordered $500 million payment to New Jersey’s 31 Abbott districts in the state budget. Lawmakers have to reach an agreement before July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year, on how to spend approximately $30 billion. Oroho said in that story that he won’t vote for a budget that sends the $500 million just to the Abbott districts. "We have the highest per-pupil cost in the country," he said. "No one can say there’s not enough money in education." PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check whether Oroho was right. The senator, a certified financial planner who serves on the Senate’s Budget and Appropriations and Economic Growth committees, told us he researched National Center for Education Statistics data going back to the 2004-05 academic year. He said his statement was based on data for 2006-07, which showed that New Jersey’s per-pupil cost -- for grades K-12 and including all school districts -- was $17,794. PolitiFact New Jersey contacted the nonpartisan National Center for Education Statistics to vet Oroho’s statistic. We studied nearly 10 years’ worth of data and found that among states, New Jersey has had the highest per-pupil cost in the nation since at least the 1999-00 school year. It’s worth noting that Washington, DC -- not a state -- had higher per-pupil costs than New Jersey from 1999-03 and from 2006-07. Cathy Clement, operations officer for the National Center for Education Statistics, explained that the center’s data comes from information reported by local jurisdictions to states, which then report the data to the U.S. Department of Education. The national center is part of the Education Department’s Institute of Education Sciences. The New Jersey Education Association, however, disputes Oroho’s claim. Spokesman Steve Baker shared with PolitiFact New Jersey the Public Education Finances: 2009 report issued May 20 by the U.S. Census Bureau. It shows that New Jersey was third in per-pupil spending for the 2008-09 year, at $16,271. New York was highest, at $18,126, followed by Washington, DC, $16,408. The National Center for Education Statistics told us the discrepancy stems from slight differences in what costs get reported and factors such as whether public charter schools are included. We also checked with the New Jersey Department of Education to see which agency’s figures they would rely on for accurate per-pupil cost data. "We often cite National Center for Education Statistics," said Alan Guenther, department spokesman. So why is education so expensive in New Jersey? Both Oroho and Baker say there are multiple factors involved. Oroho points to administrative costs and regulatory requirements as possible factors. The NJEA’s Baker, referring to the School Finance 101 blog by Bruce Baker, no relation, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University, cited special-needs programming and interventions, as well as education needs for children in poverty, as elements that contribute to per-pupil costs. Let’s return to Oroho’s statement. The senator says New Jersey has the highest per-pupil costs in the country, but admits basing that statement on data for the 2006-07 and 2007-08 school years. Still, our analysis of data from a nonpartisan arm of the U.S. Department of Education shows that among states only, New Jersey has held the title of highest per-pupil costs in the nation for nearly a decade. The U.S. Census Bureau, however, ranks New Jersey’s per-pupil spending for 2008-09 as third-highest in the nation. Therefore, we rate Oroho’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-05873	"91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college," but Marco Rubio opposes it.	true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/09/presente/most-hispanics-support-dream-act-marco-rubio-does-/	With speculation that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio may end up in the veep slot on the Republican presidential ticket, a left-leaning political group is taking out ads in Florida to say that the Hispanic vote isn’t automatically his for the taking. "Marco Rubio just might become the first Latino on the presidential ticket," the ad from Presente Action begins. "With the tea party and others attacking immigrants, does Marco Rubio stand with Latinos?" The ad goes on to juxtapose polling results against video of Rubio discussing his own political positions. The ad: "81 percent of Latinos oppose SB 1070, Arizona’s racial profiling law." Rubio: "Arizona’s going to do what’s in the best interest of the people of Arizona. They have a right to do that, and I respect that." The ad: "88 percent of Latinos support legalization for undocumented immigrants." Rubio: "I am not and I will never support -- never have and never will support -- any effort to grant blanket legalization." The ad: "91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college." Rubio: "People in the United States who are here without documents should not benefit from programs like in-state tuition." The ad concludes, "When it comes to voting for what we care about most, no somos Rubios." Translation: "We’re not Rubios," which flashes as text in English. The ad is now running on television in Florida, and Presente Action is fundraising off the ad on its website. Roberto Lovato, the group’s co-founder, told us that the ad may run nationally in the future. We’re putting one statement on our meter -- that 91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act and Rubio does not -- but we’ll look at the accuracy of the other claims as well. A note on methodology: We found many national polls that looked at general public opinion on these issues, and those polls included Hispanic respondents. But polls on the opinions of Hispanics as a group must have enough Hispanic respondents to be statistically valid, and most general polls do not meet this standard. However, we were able to find two major polling groups that focused on Hispanics: the Pew Hispanic Center and Latino Decisions. When we asked Presente to back up the ad’s claims, it pointed to various polls from these two groups. The Arizona law The ad says that "81 percent of Latinos oppose SB 1070, Arizona’s racial profiling law." That’s a somewhat loaded way to describe the 2010 law, which enlists local police authorities in cracking down on illegal immigration. Supporters of the law have said it seeks to avoid racial profiling. Most of the polls we found about the Arizona law dated back to 2010, the year the law was passed. Courts have blocked some of the law’s provisions from going into effect, and litigation is ongoing. Presente pointed us to a 2010 poll from Latino Decisions for the National Council of La Raza and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), two groups that opposed the law. That poll was only for Hispanics in Arizona. It found that 70 percent were strongly opposed, and another 11 percent were somewhat opposed, for a total of 81 percent. Pew Hispanic Center polled Hispanics nationwide on the issue, though, also in 2010. It found an almost identical level of opposition to the law at 79 percent. In 2011, Latino Decisions asked Hispanics nationwide if they would support state laws that would "require state and local police to check on immigration status." The poll found 56 percent strongly disapproved and 12 percent somewhat disapproved, for a total of 68 percent. That’s still strong opposition, but slightly lower than results from 2010. Legalization for undocumented immigrants The ad claimed that 88 percent of Latinos "support legalization for undocumented immigrants." The Pew Hispanic Center poll from 2011 asked the question this way: "What should be the priority for dealing with illegal immigration in the U.S. -- a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants; better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws; or both should be given equal priority?" Pew found that 46 percent supported both a path to citizenship and better border security; another 42 percent said just a path to citizenship. So a total of 88 percent supported a path to citizenship overall. Latino Decisions conducted a poll in January 2012 with Univision News and ABC. It asked what government policy should be toward undocumented immigrants. In this poll, 71 percent supported earned citizenship, 14 percent supported a guest worker program and 11 percent said undocumented immigrants should be considered felons. Adding the answers for legalization of some type, the total is 85 percent. The DREAM Act The ad said, "91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college." The DREAM Act stands for "Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors." The DREAM Act would have provided a path to permanent residency for young adults brought to the United States illegally as children. The young people would have to meet certain requirements, such as going to school or joining the military. In some states, they would qualify for in-state tuition at public universities. The Pew Hispanic Center’s 2011 poll found that 91 percent of Latinos favored the DREAM Act when it asked the question this way: "Thinking about immigrants whose parents brought them to the United States illegally when they were children … Would you favor or oppose a law that would let these young adults become legal residents if they go to college or serve in the military for two years?" The Latino Decisions 2012 poll asked this way: "Do you support or oppose the DREAM Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant youth a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military?" It found that 66 percent strongly supported the law, and another 19 percent somewhat supported the law, for a total of 85 percent. The margin of error for both polls was about 4 percentage points, which makes the results very close. Rubio’s views In recent months, Rubio has urged that Republicans tone down heated rhetoric on immigration policy. "The Republican Party needs to be the pro-legal immigration party," Rubio said in October. "We need to say, 'We believe in immigration, and we think it's good for America.' But it has to be orderly, a system based on law, a system that works." Still, as a U.S. senator he has opposed the federal DREAM Act and policies that could lead to citizenship for illegal immigrants. On the Arizona law, he initially expressed concern, but later said he was comfortable with changes made prior to it becoming law. We sent the ad to Rubio’s staff for comment, but we didn’t hear back. One other interesting point: Latino Decisions asked Hispanic voters in January if they would be more or less likely to vote for the Republican ticket for president if Rubio had the vice presidential spot. Nationally, 25 percent said they would be more likely to vote for the ticket, while 47 percent said it would make no difference. Another 19 percent said less likely. Florida Latinos, who are more familiar with Rubio, answered that 43 percent would be more likely to vote Republican with Rubio on the ticket, while 31 percent said it would make no difference. Another 20 percent said less likely. The ad doesn’t seem to be making electoral predictions. Rather, it seems to be making its factual points and asking viewers to draw their own conclusions. Our ruling For the Truth-O-Meter, we’re checking the claim that "91 percent of Latinos support the DREAM Act, which allows undocumented youth to attend college," while Rubio opposes the program. The Pew Hispanic Center’s polling found that to be the case, and Latino Decisions found a very similar high number of 85 percent. As a U.S. senator, Rubio has opposed the DREAM Act. We rate the ad’s statement True.	None	Presente.org	None	None	None	2012-02-09T09:00:00	2012-01-27	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-13081	"Anyone who knows you can just" look it up to "see if you voted."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/09/amy-schumer/didnt-vote-president-youll-be-shamed-comedian-amy-/	Now that the election is over, according to comedian Amy Schumer, some Americans truly have something to fear. Public shaming. "People are going to know if you voted or not," Schumer intoned in a video posted online Nov. 3, 2016, five days before the historic presidential contest. "Your voting history is public record. It doesn’t say who you voted for, but it says if you voted at all. Anyone who knows you can just look that s*** up …. "Your decision to vote or not is obviously up to you," she added. "But judging you for that decision could be up to the Internet. And everyone has access to that. Even our parents." Schumer ended the video (which showed up in the Facebook feed of more than one Wisconsinite) with a call to vote for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, while making disparaging comments about the Republican nominee (and now president-elect) Donald Trump. So, Schumer doesn’t explicitly state that you can simply go online to see if someone voted. But her just-look-it-up reference makes it sound easy. Elections experts told us that, as Schumer stated, voter records generally are public records (except, of course, who you voted for). So, by and large, a person’s voting history is generally available by request. But not everywhere. And don’t expect it to be as easy as typing a name onto a website. Let’s start with Wisconsin, one of the states that, unexpectedly, helped carry Trump to victory. In Wisconsin If you know a voter’s full name and date of birth, you can search that person’s voting history on a website maintained by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. It’s super quick. But voter participation isn’t instantly recorded. For the just-ended election, local election clerks have up to 45 days to record voter participation. And if you don’t know a person’s date of birth, the look-up is more difficult. You can still make a request of the state election commission -- or at the municipal clerk’s office, if you know where the voter lives. The request can be made by mail, email, fax or in person and, depending on how busy an office is, the records are provided as quickly as possible, state elections commission spokesman Reid Magney told us. Other states In other states, accessing voting histories can be more difficult -- or, in at least one state, not allowed. To search online in Nevada, the state requires a date of birth plus either the voter’s drivers license number or the last four digits of his or her Social Security number. Alabama doesn’t offer an online search option. Secretary of State spokesman John Bennett told us that if you make the request in person, by email or via phone from his office, often the record can be provided the same day (for 1 cent per voter, a fee that can be rounded up to $1). In Virginia, however, a voter’s voting history is not a public record that is available to the general public, the Virginia Department of Elections told us. Individual voting histories are provided, for a fee, only to groups such as candidates or political groups. That being said, it’s possible to pull up a Virginia resident’s voting history online -- but at the risk of violating the state’s computer fraud law. You must click a box certifying that you are searching for your own voter record, or that you are authorized to search for someone else’s record. (Schumer's publicist didn't respond to our requests for information.) Our rating Schumer said: "Anyone who knows you can just" look it up to "see if you voted." Generally speaking, an individual’s voting history is a public record, though how easy it is to access can vary. Depending on the state, you might need information such as a date of birth to do an online search. And if you don’t have such details, you might have to make a request from a state elections office. Moreover, an individual’s voting history is not a public record in at least one state (Virginia). For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23001946-d8d0-4426-b34d-3209ac90ff47	None	Amy Schumer	None	None	None	2016-11-09T14:30:10	2016-11-03	['None']
pomt-04417	Says six studies verify that the math adds up for Mitt Romney’s tax plan.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/15/paul-ryan/ryan-says-six-studies-say-math-works-romney-tax-pl/	Mitt Romney’s tax plan plays a vital role in his economic program. He says it by itself will create seven million new jobs. He has been defending his proposal ever since economists at the Tax Policy Center -- a team with both Republican and Democratic connections -- said the numbers in Romney’s plan do not add up. The Obama campaign has relied on that study to attack Romney in television ads and on the stump. In the vice presidential debate, the moderator pressed Paul Ryan to fill in the missing details that would allow a clear assessment of what the tax changes might do. Ryan did not provide any but claimed other analysts confirm that the plan will accomplish everything it promises. "Six studies have verified that this math adds up," Ryan said. This is a claim that Romney and Ryan first made in early September, although back then, they cited five studies. We rated it Mostly False because two of the "studies" were actually Wall Street Journal editorials and one was double-counting another research paper. Since then, the campaign has dropped the two editorials and added additional research for the new claim of six studies. For this fact check, we are building on our previous work and examining the claim in light of the additional studies being cited. The basics of Romney’s plan Briefly, Romney’s plan would cut individual and corporate rates, and eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. This would put the government in the hole about $5 trillion over 10 years, but Romney would offset that by doing away with deductions, exemptions, credits and other wrinkles in the tax code that currently give people a tax break. Some of the largest ones are the home mortgage deduction and the tax-free treatment of employer health benefits. Romney is clear about the tax cuts, but is largely silent about how he would offset them with reductions in tax breaks. However, he promises that the plan will be revenue neutral and it won’t shift the tax burden from the very rich to the middle class. The six studies Before we go through the list, we should note that all of the studies, both those supporting Romney’s plan and the one from the Tax Policy Center, speculate on the details of the deductions and tax breaks that Romney would reduce or eliminate. Martin Feldstein, in the first study, says "It is impossible to calculate the exact effects of the future reforms since Gov. Romney hasn't specified what he would do." Curtis Dubay, the author of the newest study we examine, says (Romney’s) "plan would offset the revenue loss from those changes by broadening the tax base in unspecified ways." In short, all analysts must fill in the blanks. This is akin to trying on a pair of pants before both legs are done. 1 & 2. Martin Feldstein, Harvard University "Romney’s tax plan can raise revenue" and "A reply to comments" Feldstein, an adviser to the Romney campaign, uses 2009 IRS data to demonstrate that Romney can meet all his goals and not increase taxes on the middle class. First he estimates the lost revenue due to Romney’s 20 percent across the board rate cut and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax. Feldstein figures that would be $186 billion. Next, he looks at how much could be gained by reducing or eliminating deductions. At this point, he makes an important decision. He defines high-income as households making $100,000 or more. The Tax Policy Center sets the bar at $200,000 and anyone making less is part of the middle class. By choosing the broader definition, Feldstein has a lot more revenue to work with. In 2009, Feldstein says, the total value of itemized deductions for households making $100,000 and up was about $636 billion. By his estimate, if you eliminate those deductions, the IRS stands to gain about $191 billion. "More than enough to offset the revenue losses from the individual income tax cuts proposed by Gov. Romney," Feldstein says. Feldstein underscores that he isn’t advocating such a move. He only notes that eliminating deductions, or broadening the tax base as it is called, can net huge returns. In his second piece, Feldstein defends treating households making $100,000 or more as "high-income" because they are in the upper 20 percent of income earners. He offers more details on the tax breaks that could be reduced for this group, such as tax-free health benefits and the child tax credit. The response Feldstein’s definition of middle class is at odds with the one Mitt Romney has used. In an ABC interview, Romney said people making $200,000 or less are part of the middle class and would be protected in his plan. The Tax Policy Center notes that Feldstein needs to go after the deductions used by less affluent people -- those making between $100,000 and $200,000 -- in order to make the books balance. The center analysts also notes that this assumes these people would not be allowed to take even the basic standard deduction. The group further challenges Feldstein’s use of the 30 percent tax rate, saying a more accurate estimate is 24 percent which would leave Feldstein $70 billion short of the revenues lost through the rest of Romney’s tax cuts. (In his response, Feldstein says he could use the lower rate and still make the numbers work by going after other tax breaks.) 3. Harvey Rosen, Princeton University "Growth, distribution and tax reform: Thoughts on the Romney proposal" Rosen’s main point is that any assessment of the Romney tax plan that ignores its impact on economic growth is incomplete. "This is curious," Rosen said, "because increasing growth is the motivation for the proposal in the first place." Growth creates more income for the government to tax which would help offset the revenues lost through rate cuts. Rosen readily admits that no one can accurately predict the future so he runs the numbers using three growth rates for GDP - 3 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent. By comparison, the White House budget planners assume an average rate of close to 3 percent. Like Feldstein, he used 2009 data. Unlike Feldstein, he analyzed what happens for taxpayers making $100,000 and up, and then repeated it for those making $200,000 and up. Rosen found that when all possible deductions are eliminated, from home mortgages to charitable giving to health insurance benefits, it means that increased revenues can balance out the money lost through tax cuts. There is only one scenario where Rosen saw a wrinkle -- when households making less than $200,000 are shielded from the loss of deductions under certain tax and growth assumptions. Rosen saw a $28 billion gap and said "maintaining an approximately constant tax burden on high-income individuals would be more challenging." But not "mathematically impossible." The response The criticism that the Tax Policy Center failed to account for growth is incorrect. William Gale, one of the center’s economists who was on the Council of Economic Advisers for President George H.W. Bush, says the team specifically tested their results using different assumptions of economic growth. "Incorporating the growth effects did not change the conclusion," Gale said. The center said groups including the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation take a cautious approach on assuming that tax changes alone will lead to new growth. This is particularly true when tax cuts are combined with base-broadening, which lies at the heart of the Romney plan. Both Rosen and Feldstein use 2009 data. Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California Berkeley, said 2009 presents problems for analysts. 2009 was the bottom of the recession. In pure dollar amounts, upper income households saw huge investment losses in 2008. When the stock market recovered, they offset those gains with losses from the year before. In 2009, they had less income that would benefit from the lower rates Romney proposes. Accordingly, the cost of a tax cut would be smaller and so would the amount you would need to pick up by getting rid of tax deductions and other tax breaks as Romney has said he wants. Auerbach said 2009 would be a relatively easy year to make the numbers work. 4. Matt Jensen, American Enterprise Institute, "How the Tax Policy Center could improve its Romney tax study" Jensen challenges the Tax Policy Center findings on two fronts. First, he said it should have considered the elimination of two tax breaks that the center’s analysts said "were off the table." One is the interest on state and local bonds; the other is interest on life insurance policies. "Both of these exclusions largely benefit the wealthy," Jensen said. "Added together their repeal would net upwards of $90 billion that could be redistributed to lower-income individuals." Jensen called his analysis "nothing if not rough." Jensen also said the center’s definition of who is high-income is arbitrary. Rather than declare everyone over $200,000 as high income, he suggested the center show the lowest income level at which the Romney plan would work out mathematically. The response The Tax Policy Center challenged Jensen’s "rough" number. It said a more accurate figure would be $25 billion. 5. Alex Brill, American Enterprise Institute, "The Romney tax plan: Not a tax hike on the middle class" Brill also faults the Tax Policy Center for ignoring the impact of growth, but he has three specific criticisms. He says the center made mistakes in how it dealt with taxes related to the health care reform law and gains made on insurance policies. Brill also says the center ignored the option to tax earnings from state and local bonds. The total value of these changes, Brill says, brings the Romney plan within $12 billion of balancing out. The response As with the other studies, Brill is off the mark in saying the Tax Policy Center ignored the impact of growth. On his specific criticisms, he finds support for two of them from Josh Barro, a columnist with Bloomberg News who agrees that the Obamacare taxes and life insurance gains should be folded into the picture. But on state and local bonds, Barro disagrees. He says Brill has exaggerated the potential money in this pot. Brill said it would be $20 billion. Barro says only about $5 billion of that goes to bondholders. Following the cash gets complicated very quickly but bottom line, Barro warns that if these bonds are not tax free, then state and local governments would pay more to borrow money. "A key effect would be state and local governments raising taxes (mostly not on the wealthy) to pay higher interest costs," Barro wrote. 6. Curtis Dubay, Heritage Foundation, "The Tax Policy Center’s skewed analysis of Governor Romney’s tax plan" Dubay relies on three of the studies already listed, from Feldstein, Rosen and Jensen, but adds a new criticism of the Tax Policy Center study. Dubay says the center failed to make adjustment what is called the "step-up in basis" from inherited assets. Take the example of inheriting stock from your mother. Under Romney’s plan, there would be no estate tax. If you sold the stock, you would owe taxes on any profit. That profit, Dubay says, should be based on the value of the stock when your mother bought it, not its value when you inherited it. The difference is called a "step-up" and getting rid of it makes a lot more money taxable. The Tax Policy Center did not count on this, producing a "critical error" that "significantly biases" the results, Dubay says. He estimated the value at $19 billion. The response Gale with the Tax Policy Center says Dubay’s change would not generate the revenues he predicts for two reasons. First, not all the inherited property would be sold and for any that wasn’t, no tax would be collected. Second, Dubay uses the current tax rates to calculate the tax collections, but Romney would cut those rates and so the amount of revenues would drop. Our ruling Ryan said that six studies verify that the numbers in the Romney tax plan add up. Hearing that, you might think that each is independent research. But not all studies are created equal and these come from people or groups with ties to Romney. Two of those studies come from Feldstein, a Romney campaign adviser. Three come from conservative think tanks, the Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute, which have analysts who advise the Romney campaign. While every analyst would insist that they make their own judgments, the Tax Policy Center is fully independent of the Obama campaign. The studies from Feldstein and Rosen use 2009 data. That was an abnormal year and one that made it easier to make the math work for the Romney plan. The analysts could have chosen other years but decided not to. Of the studies that examine the middle class tax burden, none shows conclusively that households making less than $200,000 would be spared a tax increase. That is a group of taxpayers that Romney defines as middle class and says he would protect. None of the studies can accurately model Romney’s tax plan because he has said so little about how he would pay for it. As a result, all of them make assumptions as to what tax breaks might be reduced. They can speak in rough terms about a concept, but they can not verify a plan when no detailed plan exists. We see no more than one fully independent study out of the six claimed. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-10-15T18:09:49	2012-10-11	['None']
pomt-02748	Iran President Hassan "Rouhani has more Cabinet members with Ph.D.s from American universities" than members of Barack Obama’s Cabinet.	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/16/bob-schieffer/bob-schieffer-says-iran-president-hassan-rouhani-h/	Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is seen as a moderate more willing to engage the West, in part because of the backgrounds of his closest advisers. Unlike brash, hard-lined predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Rouhani nominated several cabinet members with advanced degrees from other countries -- a fact that surfaced during a discussion on the Iranian nuclear deal moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS’ Face the Nation. "I was very interested that I read, I think it was in The Atlantic, that Rouhani has more cabinet members with Ph.D.s from American universities, he has more of those in his cabinet than President (Barack) Obama does," Schieffer said at the Dec. 9, 2013, forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Intrigued by the point, we wanted to know if it was true. Just days earlier, The Atlantic published "The Case for Giving Iran's Scholar-Diplomats a Chance" by contributing editor Moisés Naím, a senior associate in international economics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. His column began with exactly the information we were looking for: Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, has more cabinet members with Ph.D. degrees from U.S. universities than Barack Obama does. In fact, Iran has more holders of American Ph.D.s in its presidential cabinet than France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, or Spain — combined. What’s the significance? The cabinet of scholars could launch a new chapter in Iran’s typically troubled relations with western countries and negotiations over its nuclear program -- or not, Naím wrote, since the country’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, ultimately calls the shots. "But compared to the kind of people that Ahmadinejad had in his cabinet, they were a very different kind of crowd," Naím told PunditFact by phone. "So one would expect people with American Ph.D.s to be more sophisticated, more integrated in the world." His piece singled out three Iranian cabinet officials from the 30-position body with American degrees. PunditFact verified each of the following officials graduated from these American universities: Mohammad Agha Nahavandian, Rouhani’s chief of staff, was awarded a Ph.D. in economics on Jan. 30, 1994, from George Washington University. Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country’s foreign affairs minister, completed his Ph.D. in international law and politics at the University of Denver in 1988. Zarif, who was the lead negotiator in the nuclear deal, was Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations based in New York. Ali Akbar Salehi, a vice president and head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, earned a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1977. Several other members of Rouhani’s Cabinet graduated from universities in Europe, according to Naím’s piece. His minister of information and communications technology, Mahmoud Vaezi, enrolled at a doctoral program at Louisiana State University after studying at other American schools but ended up finishing his Ph.D. in international relations at Warsaw University in Poland. Even Rouhani earned a doctorate from Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland, and several other members have advanced degrees from Iranian universities. Rouhani’s cabinet has an important role in preparing policy and budgets, but it’s not all that powerful because decisions can be overruled by the supreme leader’s office and the Guardian Council, which is appointed by the supreme leader and considers legislation, said Alex Vatanka, an expert on Iran at the Middle East Institute. The U.S. Cabinet does not face similar wildcards, he said. "There is no sort of element of surprise in the middle of it with one of the priests coming from nearby churches saying, ‘No, no, this is ungodly and shouldn’t be done’," Vatanka said. "The cabinet has been a way for the president to cautiously advance a reform agenda in Iran," said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He pointed out that another Rouhani adviser who is not in the cabinet, Mahmood Sariolghalam, earned a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California. How does Obama’s Cabinet compare? There are a couple of ways of looking at Obama’s Cabinet, and neither measure produces more doctoral degrees from American universities than the three we confirmed in Iran. The U.S. cabinet is stacked with lawyers, which is pretty typical. The advisory group includes Vice President Joe Biden and the leaders of 15 executive agencies. Of those, just one has an American Ph.D. Ernest Moniz, Obama’s energy secretary, has no fewer than four honorary degrees. The one that counts for our purpose is his doctorate in theoretical physics from Stanford University. If you expand the pool to include seven more Cabinet-rank officials listed on the same White House page, you find another doctorate. That’s Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, who earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University (as well as master’s degrees in government from Harvard and in economics from the London School of Economics). Our ruling Bob Schieffer referenced an Atlantic piece when he said Rouhani’s cabinet has more members with Ph.D.s from American universities than Obama’s. While we could not nail down the academic background of each member of Iran’s cabinet, we found enough members with verifiable degrees -- three -- to deem his statement accurate. Obama has two, including one official with Cabinet-rank. What it all means for international relations remains to be seen. We rate Schieffer’s statement True.

pomt-00526	"Between 2010 and 2014, there was no net in-migration from Mexico."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/22/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-zero-net-migration-mexico-2010/	Among the more inflammatory words out of Donald Trump’s mouth during his kick-off speech were the ones about Mexico. "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best," Trump said as he announced his White House bid. "They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems (to) us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." That last phrase hardly counterbalanced the rest. Mexican officials took serious offense. The interior minister said the charge was absurd and prejudiced, and that it served only to generate controversy. The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart had a go at Trump with former President Bill Clinton on June 17, 2015. Clinton: "What he said about the Mexicans, which was …" Stewart: "Bizarre." Clinton: "Not only that, just wrong. Basically between 2010 and 2014, there was no net in-migration from Mexico. That surprise you all? All we read about is the violence and the drug war. The truth is that the previous president built 140 tuition free universities. Two years ago, the Mexicans produced 113,000 engineers. We produced 120,000. They’ve had very brisk growth, and except in the narco-centers, the crime rate, the murder rate has gone down. It’s a very interesting country." There’s plenty of interesting statistics there, but we’ll focus just on the one about zero net in-migration. We asked the Clinton Foundation for the data behind that claim but didn’t hear back. Still, we were able to reach experts who were able to walk us through the numbers. One way to measure net migration (the number of new arrivals versus the number who leave) is the count of people living in America who were born in Mexico. The Census Bureau tracks this. We used two sets of numbers from the American Community Survey -- an estimate based on three years of surveys and an estimate based on just the year the survey took place. Year Born in Mexico 3-year average estimate (1,000s) 1-year estimate (1,000s) 2013 11,604 11,585 2012 11,650 11,563 2011 11,700 11,673 2010 11,642 11,711 Source: American Community Survey While there’s a little variation, both estimates show a drop from 2010 to 2013. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us that the Mexican-born figures are a valid indicator of the overall trend. "This strongly implies zero net (migration)," Camarota said. Another researcher, Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute, echoed that point. What about 2014? That’s the end point for Clinton’s comparison, but finalized numbers aren’t out yet. To get a sense of what the numbers might say, Camarota dug into the raw monthly counts from the Current Population Survey. These figures are less reliable, but they too show a consistent decline for Mexicans living in the United States in each of the first quarters of 2012 through 2014. (Camarota did find a rise in the first quarter of 2015, but that is outside Clinton’s window.) We should note that using a population count isn’t a perfect yardstick. In theory, a higher death rate could drive the numbers down, but that’s unlikely. First, it would be headline news if thousands of people started dying like that. Second, Rosenblum noted that Mexican immigrants tend to be in their prime working years and younger people are healthier. A more complete study of net migration from Mexico came out in 2012. The Pew Research Center reported back then that based on census data from both sides of the border, from 2005 to 2010, more people moved from America to Mexico than the reverse. That study raised the possibility that the net migration rate wasn’t just zero -- it might actually be negative. Rosenblum thinks that’s probably still true because some factors behind the shift show no sign of letting up. In short, Clinton is right on the general trend experts agree, though we don’t yet have the numbers for 2014 to completely confirm his point. Four reasons for the decline Demographics is possibly the biggest driver of the change in migration. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990 and now stands at 2.2 children per woman. Rosenblum said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. "In the 1980s, there was a surge of teenagers," Rosenblum said. "With the birth rate having been down for several decades, we’re now seeing many fewer Mexicans entering the prime working age group." Rosenblum said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop of more than 50 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped over half a million people coming in from Mexico. Last year, it was about 230,000. Not all of those people were Mexican, but the numbers are in line with the picture Clinton paints. Rosenblum also believes that more surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect. "All that enforcement has begun to pay off," he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling Clinton said that between 2010 and 2014, there was zero net in-migration from Mexico. The census data to prove that is not in for 2014, but the numbers up to 2013 support his point, as do very preliminary 2014 data.The population of people living in America but born in Mexico fell by about 40,000 since 2010. That’s not a perfect measure, but the experts we reached said it is a strong indication of a prevailing trend. The experts we reached said that other data, including a rapid decline in apprehensions at the border and changing demographics in Mexico add weight to the conclusion that Clinton was correct. With a caveat for the missing year of survey information, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2015-06-22T12:09:47	2015-06-17	['Mexico']
pomt-07894	"We currently have one guy who is in charge of painting the entire Milwaukee County parks system."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/04/jim-sullivan/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jim-sullivan-/	Jim Sullivan, one of five candidates running for Milwaukee County executive, said in an interview that in privatizing county services "we’ve gone about far enough." The former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa noted that an arbitrator had recently ordered the county to rehire courthouse security guards. Under then-County Executive Scott Walker, the guards had been laid off and replaced with private guards in an effort to save money. Sullivan also cited what he described as another example of bad privatization. "It’s been brought to my attention we currently have one guy who is in charge of painting the entire Milwaukee County parks system," he told the Journal Sentinel on Jan. 31, 2011. "You hear the expression ‘busier than a one-armed paper hanger’ and this guy’s got to be a really busy guy." Sullivan went on to say that if the county hired more employees to paint, they would be less expensive and more responsive than painters hired on contract. The question of public vs private painters is its own issue. Privatization of various county services was a priority for Walker, who clashed with the County Board over his efforts but did privatize janitorial services, projecting it would save $2.6 million. What stopped us about Sullivan’s comment was this: Is there really just one guy in charge of all the painting for the more than 140 county parks? Gillian Morris, Sullivan’s campaign aide, said Sullivan was told about the lone county parks painter by John Jorgensen, business manager of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades AFL-CIO. So we turned to him. Jorgensen said that for years, the county has been eliminating trade positions such as painters and carpenters. He said the only county painter left in the parks system is one of his union members, Tim Hanson. So we found Hanson. It turns out Hanson, 50, also happens to hold the part-time position of Wauwatosa alderman. A county employee since 1988, he said he’s been the parks’ only painter for two years, ever since the county stopped using apprentice painters. As a result, Hanson said, most of his time is spent on a priority job: graffiti patrol. "I’m removing more paint than I’m applying," he said. Hanson may be the only county staffer assigned to do painting in the parks. But he is not the only person with a brush and a roller there. Some paint jobs are contracted out to painters from private companies, some painting is done privately as part of larger renovation projects and painting is also done by partners such as the Bartolotta Restaurants, which operates Lake Park Bistro, according to Parks Director Sue Black. In addition, when Hanson is off, some of the county’s seven public works painters pitch in, said Public Works Director Jack Takerian. But overall, the majority of painting work in the parks is done by Hanson, according to Jim Keegan, the parks system’s chief of administration. OK, we’ve painted you a picture. Let’s assess Sullivan’s statement. The would-be county executive claimed there’s only "one guy who is in charge of painting the entire Milwaukee County parks system." He’s the one as busy as that one-armed paper hanger. That comment was a pretty broad brush, since there may only be one full-time painter, but the parks use many private ones. Sullivan’s claim was accurate, but leaves out important details. That’s the PolitiFact definition for Half True. And that’s our rating.

pomt-00491	"There is a big correlation between third grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison. And in Florida right now only 56 percent of kids are coming out of third grade at third grade reading level."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/aug/07/jeff-greene/greenes-third-grade-statistics-mostly-hold/	With the Florida governor’s Democratic primary set for Aug. 28, Jeff Greene has made education a vital piece of his platform. In a July 29 interview, Greene said, "There is a big correlation between third-grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison. And in Florida right now, only 56 percent of kids are coming out of third grade at third-grade reading level." It’s spooky to imagine that the performance of an eight-year-old could predict their destiny more than a decade later. We decided to see if Greene’s statistics held up. Correlation between reading level and college A 2010 study by the University of Chicago found that third-grade reading level can be a powerful predictor of future academic success. Researchers tracked thousands of students in the Chicago Public School system from third grade through their high school graduations. The students took a test in the third grade that measured their reading ability and compared their results with national scores. Students who scored lower than 75 percent of third graders nationwide were defined as "below grade level." Among students who read below grade level in third grade, only 45 percent graduated high school in five years. Graduation rates were much higher for students who read at grade-level (60 percent) and above grade level (80 percent). The study controlled for demographic factors, so researchers could examine the correlation between test scores and graduation rates without worrying that race or poverty were influencing the results. Though the variables are correlated -- which means a change in one is connected to a change in the other -- the connection is not causal. Low third grade test scores are not causing kids to dropout of high school. Likewise, students who read at or below grade level in third grade were significantly less likely to attend college than their peers. Only about 20 percent of below-grade-level students attended college, whereas roughly a third of at grade-level students did. Nearly 60 percent of above-grade-level readers attended college. Reading level and prison There are no studies that directly connect third-grade reading level to incarceration, so the Greene campaign connected it by a two-step process. As noted in the Chicago study, and backed up by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and Georgia governor’s office, students who score below grade level on third grade reading tests are less likely to graduate. Then, there are studies that show high school dropouts are more likely to go to prison. A study from Northeastern University showed that a man with a high school degree had a 1 in 33 chance of incarceration. For a high school dropout, that rate rose to 1 in 10. So, the Greene campaign argues, students who read below grade-level in third grade tend not to graduate high school, and people who don’t graduate high school tend to have higher incarceration rates. Katharine Abraham, director of the University of Maryland Center for Economics and Public Policy, said this conclusion "seems plausible but doesn’t necessarily follow from the cited facts." The term "correlation" implies that two variables are related, and that one will change alongside the other. One can not assume that because variables A and B are related, and B and C are related, A is also correlated to C. For example, there might be a correlation between higher temperatures and sunny days. There might also be a correlation between sunny days and the number of people who get sunburned. However, this does not mean there is a direct correlation between higher temperatures and sunburns. When asked if it would be accurate to say test scores are correlated to incarceration, Abraham said, "It might well be true, but you can't logically draw that inference." The "56 percent" Greene also said that only 56 percent of kids in Florida are coming out of third grade at the appropriate reading level. He had more concrete data to back up this claim. He was referring to the results of the most recent administration of the Florida Standards Assessments, which were released in May 2018. The Florida Standards Assessments, or FSA, are a suite of standardized tests that Florida public schools students in grades 3-10 take yearly. They include mathematics exams as well as reading and writing exams. Students’ results on the FSA are classified into five groups, the lowest being Level 1 and highest being Level 5. Level 3 or higher means the student is reading at grade level or above. The spring 2018 results of the English Language Arts (ELA) Grade 3 Reading Exam show that 57 percent of third grade students scored at Level 3 or above. So Greene actually undersold his point. The statistic he was referring to kept track of students reading at or above grade level, not just those reading at grade level. Our ruling Greene said, "There is a big correlation between third grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison. And in Florida right now only 56 percent of kids are coming out of third grade at third grade reading level." Studies have shown that there are correlations between elementary school reading proficiency, high school graduation, and college attendance. There are also studies which show a correlation between high school dropout rates and incarceration. However, experts say that you can’t assume a direct correlation between reading scores and prison rates based on this data alone. Greene claimed that "there is a big correlation between third grade reading level … and whether you go to prison." This might be true, but we cannot know for sure. In addition, the results from the 2018 administration of the Florida Standards Assessments show that only 57 percent of third graders pass the reading test at or above grade level. So Greene is correct on that point. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jeff Greene	None	None	None	2018-08-07T14:40:48	2018-07-29	['None']
pomt-07808	"Within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/17/mitch-daniels/mitch-daniels-says-interest-debt-will-soon-exceed-/	Budget season in Washington often brings out colorful comparisons designed to highlight economic folly. Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana offered one in his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 11, 2011. Speaking at the CPAC Ronald Reagan Centennial Dinner, Daniels likened the mounting national debt to a foreign invader -- a "new Red Menace, this time consisting of ink." The possible presidential candidate then declared that servicing that debt will soon cost more than national security: "We are currently borrowing the entire defense budget from foreign investors," Daniels told conservative conference-goers. "Within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security. That is not, as our military friends say, a ‘robust strategy.’" We decided to do the math on that striking comparison for ourselves. As is often the case, different definitions can change the budget picture dramatically -- though not enough to make Daniels’ claim hold up. The White House’s newly released budget seemed like a good place to start. Handily, it divides discretionary spending into security-related outlays (including Defense, Homeland Security and ongoing wars) and everything else. Projected security spending rises from $815 billion in 2010 to $914 billion in 2021. (It dips slightly along the way, reflecting savings from planned troop reductions in Iraq and Afghanistan.) Meanwhile the budget has net interest payments rising fourfold, from $196 billion last year to a stunning $844 billion by 2021. As two budget analysts we interviewed confirmed, interest payments will grow explosively over the next decade but do not exceed security spending in any given year -- much less "in a few years." Of course White House budget proposals are just that, proposals, so we ran the comparison again using the Congressional Budget Office’s latest baseline forecasts. Daniels did a little better here, because the CBO’s measure of discretionary "defense" spending excludes Homeland Security and several other budget lines. Still, defense spending topped interest payments through 2021. Is there any way to make Daniels’ math add up? If you limit "national security" spending to the Department of Defense budget -- an extremely narrow definition -- then interest payments pull ahead in 2017 (or perhaps in 2016, since outlays usually fall short of budget authority). Another possibility would be to apply a worst-case scenario to the U.S. debt forecast, explained Josh Gordon, policy director with the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction. If federal spending isn’t restrained at all, and if Bush-era tax cuts become permanent, by 2021 interest payments might sneak past national defense. "But that’s an odd position for a Republican presidential candidate to take," Gordon said. In a follow-up e-mail he explained that "for Daniels to assume discretionary spending rises at 3 percent a year over ten years means he is assuming Republicans will have no effect on the levels of government spending over the next ten years, or even that they will encourage Obama to spend more than he is proposing to spend in his budget." When we asked Gov. Daniels’ office to explain his reasoning, a spokesperson pointed out that the current defense budget "is close to $700 billion," and that by the end of the decade, under White House estimates, "we will be paying $700 billion a year" to service the national debt. She directed us to a Nov. 24, 2009, piece in the Washington Examiner making a similar point. But that’s hardly "in a few years" -- and more important, it compares apples today to oranges a decade from now. This mathematical sleight-of-hand was not disclosed in Daniels' speech. So he is incorrect that "within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security." It is true that interest on the national debt will grow faster than any other category of federal spending, even Medicare. But the comparison Daniels drew to illustrate that falls short under any reasonable definition of "national security" spending. We rate his statement False.

pomt-12124	"There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. ... There’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don't know."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/16/roy-moore/alabamas-roy-moore-says-whole-communities-midwest-/	On the eve of his first-place finish in the Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, Roy Moore -- a former Alabama judge who advocated for the display of the Ten Commandments -- attracted some attention for a comment he made about Muslim Sharia law. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life, including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings, but Muslims differ on its interpretation. Some commentators, particularly on the right, have warned that Sharia poses a threat to the United States’ legal system. But PolitiFact has debunked a string of claims about the influence of Sharia law (or aspects of it) in the United States, including by retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who became President Donald Trump’s short-lived national security adviser. Moore made his comments during a campaign stop to meet with members of the pro-gun group BamaCarry Inc. There, reporter Jeff Stein of the website Vox.com asked him, "Some right-wing conservatives think Sharia law is a danger to America -- do you?" Moore responded, "There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. Christian communities; I don’t know if they may be Muslim communities. But Sharia law is a little different from American law. It is founded on religious concepts." Stein pressed Moore to name the communities under Sharia law. He responded, "Well, there’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana -- up there. I don't know." Later in the interview, Stein tried again, asking Moore to be specific and name which communities he was referring to. Moore said, "I was informed that there were. But if they’re not, it doesn’t matter. Sharia law incorporates Muslim law into the law. That’s not what we do. We do not punish people according to the Christian precepts of our faith -- so there’s a difference." So are there really entire communities that ignore U.S. law and operate instead under Sharia law? We found zero evidence of it. (We did not hear back from the Moore campaign.) The office of the Illinois attorney general told PolitiFact that there are "no communities under Sharia law" in the state. Experts were equally dubious. "Seriously, I've never heard of any such thing," said Nathan J. Brown, director of George Washington University’s Institute for Middle East Studies and a specialist on the rule of law in the Arab world. "I suspect the only accurate part of his statement is when he confesses, ‘I don't know.’ " Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na‘im, an Emory University law professor, was equally skeptical. "I have not seen evidence of entire communities being run by Sharia law anywhere in the United States," An-Na‘im said. In fact, "it is legally impossible for any community anywhere in the United States to be ‘under Sharia law’ simply because for that to happen, Sharia law must be enacted as the law of the state, and that is unconstitutional under the First Amendment." Specifically, the First Amendment "allows for accommodation but not establishment," said Cyra Akila Choudhury, a law professor at Florida International University. "So, private groups may choose to abide by religious law, such as Jews who abide by judgments made by rabbinical courts and Muslims who might abide by a decision made by their Sharia council or imam. But to assert that Sharia is being enforced by the state is entirely incorrect." That exception -- the use of religious law to settle intra-community disputes between consenting parties, outside of the United States legal system -- is sometimes a source of confusion for critics of Sharia law, experts said. "If Muslims choose to abide by Sharia as a private matter with regard to the practice of their religion, it is protected by the Constitution insofar as the practice does not contravene the laws of the land," Choudhury said. "So, for example, Sharia principles of criminal law would not be given accommodation. Or, if you marry in the United States, your religious ceremony may not be recognized unless you have a state license and conform to the state's requirements." Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, agreed that his group knows of no such Sharia-ruled communities. Making such a suggestion, he added, "feeds into the fear that Muslims are attempting to impose their laws on others in our country. Individual Muslims and their families may voluntarily observe Sharia-related rituals, but this is no different from Jews or Christians living their lives in accordance with the dictates of their own religious traditions." Tuchman suggested that Moore might have been mistakenly referring to a satirical column published in the Daily Beast in 2015. The column, written by Muslim-American radio host and comedian Dean Obeidallah, was headlined, "Next, We Muslims Bring Sharia to Indiana." It poked fun at Indiana, which was facing criticism for a new religious-liberty law signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the vice president. In the column, Obeidallah jokingly floated ways that Muslims could take advantage of a law that was mostly supported by conservative Christians. "Some might be asking, could Muslims really impose Sharia law in some fashion in Indiana -- turning Indiana into a mini Muslim caliphate?" he wrote. "Well, the Indiana law doesn’t just provide ‘religious liberty’ for Christians. It provides ‘liberty’ for all faiths, and that includes us Muslims. … There are now so many things we can do in Indiana that we are not able to do in the rest of America," from taking more than one wife to requiring that restaurants institute halal-compliant rules. When we brought Moore’s comments to Obeidallah’s attention, he responded, "LOL." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Moore said, "There are communities under Sharia law right now in our country. Up in Illinois. ... There’s Sharia law, as I understand it, in Illinois, Indiana — up there. I don't know." After checking with multiple experts, we found no evidence of such a community.

Mark Pocan says questions about possible ties between President Donald Trump and Russia must be answered before Congress can take up issues such as the Affordable Care Act and tax reform. Making his points in a March 3, 2017, Wisconsin Public Television interview, the Madison-area Democrat also made a Russia-related claim about Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior adviser in his administration, that we want to check. The claim came during this exchange between Pocan and Frederica Freyberg, host of the talk show "Here and Now:" Pocan: When a country like Russia comes in and interferes with our elections, that should bother everybody. And I give people like John McCain and others credit, because they’re saying that. But the fact that Donald Trump acts like nothing happened, makes me even more suspicious of how much he knows and when he knew about it. Freyberg: What about other people across the aisle, your peers, are they taking this as seriously as you are? Pocan: More and more are, as more of this information comes out. So, I think at first, they also were told, Oh, there’s nothing here to look at, nothing here to look at. But now you find out the son-in-law of the president met with Russian officials at the Trump Tower after having them come in the back door. Did Kushner meet with Russian officials at Trump Tower who came in the back door? The evidence Pocan’s office pointed us to a New York Times news article published the day before Pocan’s interview. It reported that the White House said Kushner had taken part in a meeting with one Russian official. According to the Times: In December 2016, Michael Flynn, who at the time was Trump’s incoming national security adviser, and Kushner met at Trump Tower with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. The purpose was to establish a line of communication between the new administration and the Russian government. Flynn appears to have been "the main interlocutor with the Russian envoy — the two were in contact during the campaign and the transition, Kislyak and current and former American officials have said." "They generally discussed the relationship and it made sense to establish a line of communication," said White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks. "Jared has had meetings with many other foreign countries and representatives — as many as two dozen other foreign countries’ leaders and representatives." "It is common and not improper for transition officials to meet with foreign officials," the Times article said. "But all meetings between Trump associates and Russians are now significant as the FBI investigates Russian interference in the American election and whether anyone close to Trump’s campaign was involved." Kushner’s attendance at the meeting was first reported by the New Yorker magazine. The White House also confirmed the meeting to other news media. Pocan’s office also cited a news article in The Telegraph, a British newspaper, that said the Russian diplomat "reportedly" entered Trump Tower for the meeting by a back entrance. We found a few claims and assumptions that the ambassador entered the building by a rear entrance, but no definitive reports that that was the case. Our rating Pocan said Kushner "met with Russian officials at the Trump Tower after having them come in the back door."

pomt-04398	Says Barack Obama has pension investments that include Chinese firms, and "investments through a Caymans trust."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-also-has-investments-chinese-com/	One of the many tense moments in the second presidential debate turned on a new topic in the race: President Barack Obama’s pension account. Here’s how it came up: Early in the face-off, Obama scoffed at Mitt Romney’s pledge to crack down on unfair trading practices by China, saying Romney is currently invested in companies "that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks." Romney later explained that, yes, he understands that his blind trust has invested in foreign firms, including companies in China. Then he confronted Obama. Romney: "Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? Have you looked at your pension?" Obama: "You know, I don’t look at my pension. It’s not as big as yours so it doesn’t take as long. I don’t check it that often." Romney: "Let me give you some advice. Look at your pension. You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust." The exchange was a role reversal: An Obama campaign ad in July 2012 claimed Romney had millions in the Cayman Islands, among other "tax havens." We rated that True, noting that nothing was illegal or improper about the investments through his blind trust. We also reviewed an Obama claim from an ad in September 2012 that said, "Even today part of Romney’s fortune is invested in China." We rated that Mostly True, noting that Romney had money invested in funds that owned shares in two Chinese firms, but that Obama’s claim suggested Romney had more to do with the investment decision than is the case. (We further noted that the New York Times reported that one of the funds had invested in a Chinese video surveillance company that supplies cameras to police for watching public spaces.) Okay, so what about Romney’s debate description of Obama’s pension investments? The Romney campaign told us it was referring to investments made by the Illinois State Board of Investment on behalf of the state employees’ retirement system there. Obama, you may recall, was an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004 before winning election to the U.S. Senate. He is a participant in the General Assembly Retirement System in Illinois, said William Atwood, executive director of the Board of Investment, who confirmed that for us. The Romney campaign pointed us to that pension fund’s holding in an entity that is part of Advent International. Advent has described itself as "one of the world’s most global private equity firms" and has buyout offices in 16 countries. Atwood confirmed that the pension fund has invested $30 million in one of Advent’s limited partnerships, Advent International GPE VI-A. That partnership was organized in the Cayman Islands, Atwood said. Public filings back that up. What about Romney’s broader claims, about Obama’s foreign investments? The Illinois pension fund also has numerous foreign investments, including in Chinese companies, as part of its diversified portfolio, Atwood said. The Obama campaign has connected Romney’s overseas investments in the Caymans to methods for avoiding U.S. taxes. But there’s no evidence Obama receives any tax advantage from his overseas pension investments. David S. Miller, a tax attorney with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP in New York, reviewed public filings by Advent and said it was highly unlikely Obama got any tax advantage from the pension fund’s investment in the Advent partnership. Atwood went further, saying: "There is no tax advantage to any (pension) plan participant" from that investment. Miller offered this analysis: "There is no evidence that the fund helped the Illinois pension fund avoid any taxes – in this respect, the Illinois pension fund would have been treated identically had the fund been organized as a domestic (U.S.) partnership. However, the fact that it was organized as a Cayman partnership might have allowed some taxable investors to defer some tax on foreign (non-U.S.) portfolio companies purchased by the Fund." Atwood emphasized that neither Obama nor any other participant in the retirement system has anything to do with selecting investments for the fund. Miller concurred with that, and added that Romney legitimately can claim that he has similar distance from foreign investments made through his individual retirement accounts. It’s "entirely accurate" for Romney to say that Obama’s pension plan has investments in foreign companies and through a Caymans trust, Miller said. Technically, it’s a Cayman-based partnership, but that’s a trivial difference, he added. Our rating Romney told Obama: "You also have investments in Chinese companies. You also have investments outside the United States. You also have investments through a Caymans trust." It’s an accurate set of statements when you consider investments made by managers of the Illinois pension fund in which Obama has an account. As we noted in reviewing previous claims about Romney’s investments in China, the investments involved are indirect and -- as far as anybody has said -- made without the knowledge of the account holder. With that clarification, we rate Romney’s statement Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-17T17:50:03	2012-10-16	['Cayman_Islands', 'China']
pomt-08979	"Forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/16/marco-rubio/marco-rubios-favorite-statistic/	Conservative champion Marco Rubio has declared war on President Barack Obama's spending habits. He blasts the growing deficit, vulnerable entitlement programs and congressional earmarks on network interviews and at whistle stops across the state. He unveiled a spending plan that calls for making President George W. Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, ending the inheritance tax and nixing a value-added tax. And, in one of his most reliable lines, Rubio links the federal budget to his offspring's economic future. "Forty cents of every dollar being spent by the federal government is being borrowed from my children," he told Fox News on June 28, 2010. "I think that's outrageous. We have to stop doing that." Rubio repeated the claim at an event just outside of St. Petersburg on July 13: "Forty cents of every dollar the federal government spends is borrowed from my children's and your children's and grandchildren's generation. No Americans before have ever done that — not at this perverse level, not at this sustained rate." Given that Rubio's budget beef has become the heart of his Tea Party-esque stump speech, we wondered whether the father of four was using hard numbers or pushing some kind of GOP fairy tale. The Rubio campaign directed us to an Associated Press article published in the New York Times on Feb. 4, 2010: "The House voted Thursday to allow the government to go $1.9 trillion deeper in debt, an increase of about $6,000 for every United States resident. The accumulated debt already amounts to roughly $40,000 per person. The debt increase, approved 217 to 212, is only enough to keep the government afloat for about another year as it borrows more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends." "This was a widely reported stat," said campaign spokesman Alex Burgos. The Associated Press report doesn't cite a source, but a quick review of the White House's budget summaries shows Rubio's 40 percent claim is as authentic as a 24-pack of Silly Bandz. The White House spent $3.5 trillion during the 2009-2010 fiscal year, of which $1.4 trillion could not be paid for, creating a deficit of exactly 40 percent. Policy and economic experts confirmed that the numbers in the White House's budget summary are a credible source. "They may have actually got that figure from me," said Brian Riedl, the Heritage Foundation's lead budget analyst who has discussed the 40 percent figure in various media reports. "It's solid, basic math. It just calculates the deficit as a percentage of total spending." Everyone we spoke with said the deficit will eventually need to be trimmed -- and soon. But, Rubio's larger point -- that the deficit is bad policy -- was largely debated. "The reason the deficit is so big right now is because we have a massive economic meltdown and deficit spending is appropriate," said Elliott Parker, a University of Nevada Reno economics professor Parker opposes Rubio's spending plan. "This is politics at its silliest," Parker said. "You cannot simultaneously make Bush’s tax cuts permanent and deal with the federal deficit, unless you are willing to severely cut Social Security and Medicare." Leonard Burman, a Syracuse University public affairs professor and a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at the Department of the Treasury, also cautioned against using current deficit figures as a rallying call. The White House's budget predicts the deficit will fall to 33 percent in 2011, 22 percent in 2012 and 17 percent by 2015 under current policy. However, Burman, like Rubio, expressed concern that Obama has not taken more forceful actions to decrease the deficit. One of Obama's high-profile solutions was to form a debt commission, which is due to make recommendations to Congress by December. "I hope the commission is successful, but I also hope to see the Tooth Fairy some day," Burman deadpanned. In short, we can't predict whether the Rubio children will be stuck with our tab. That is up to future policy decisions. What we do know is in this instance, when it comes to the hard numbers, father still knows best: The United States government spent 40 percent more than what it collected during the most recent fiscal year. We rate this claim True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-07-16T12:12:36	2010-06-28	['None']
pomt-03052	"Eighty-five percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/04/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-only-15-percent-federal-spending-be/	When someone says the government is "shut down," it sounds like most services have ground to a halt, except for activities to protect life and property. But Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., suggests that dire image is exaggerated. During an interview on CNN on Oct. 2, 2013, Paul told anchor Erin Burnett that "85 percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down." Is he right? We took a closer look and found that there are different ways to measure government. Government spending is one way, but the picture changes when you look at the federal workforce. First, some background. A government shutdown happens when one particular kind of federal funding stops flowing -- money that’s appropriated by Congress. Appropriations bills are supposed to be passed annually, though in recent years, acrimony between Congress and the president has made it happen more irregularly. However, other types of federal spending are unaffected by the shutdown because they aren’t subject to annual appropriations. An important one is known as mandatory spending -- money paid out to anyone who meets a fixed definition, such as someone who qualifies for Social Security or Medicare. Much of President Barack Obama’s health care law is also unaffected by the shutdown since it is not dependent on regular appropriations, Also, interest payments on the debt are not affected by a shutdown. So if you’re trying to determine how much spending is "on" during a shutdown and how much is "off," you have to compare the amounts that fit into these various categories. According to the fiscal year 2014 figures from the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency -- the federal budget includes $2.2 trillion for mandatory spending, plus $237 billion in interest payments. These two categories add up to $2.4 trillion, out of a total budget of $3.6 trillion -- or about 68 percent. The percentage grows closer to Paul’s estimate of 85 percent once you add in spending on military personnel. Such spending would ordinarily be subject to cutbacks, but it was exempted by enactment of the Pay Our Military Act, which Congress passed and the president signed shortly before the shutdown began. Paul’s office, citing Senate Budget Committee calculations, said the Pay Our Military Act frees up $225 billion in payments to be paid. That brings the percentage up to 74 percent. And the percentage rises further once you count the costs of federal activities that are continuing during the shutdown because they safeguard the public’s safety and property. The problem is that it’s hard to nail down exactly how much money is being spent on such activities, since we’re so early in the shutdown and because many of the decisions have been made on the fly. In order to reach Paul’s 85 percent threshold, the government would need to be spending $404 billion from its "discretionary" (or appropriated) budget beyond military personnel. That means the government would be spending 43 percent of the remaining discretionary spending on activities that continue through the shutdown. Experts we spoke to said that percentage is plausible. Even if you cut that $404 billion figure in half, Paul would still be pretty close -- the figure would be 79 percent rather than 85 percent. We’ll only know the final number for certain after the shutdown is over. Still, spending isn’t the only way to look at this issue. For instance, if you look at the number of federal employees furloughed, the percentage left unscathed by the shutdown is likely much lower than the 85 percent figure Paul cited for spending. Estimates published in the New York Times suggest that at least six agencies were expecting to keep 20 percent or less of their workforce laboring through the shutdown, with another three expecting to continue employing between 21 percent and 50 percent. Using spending as the unit of measurement biases the perception of how far-reaching the shutdown is, because so much of the budget is spent on things like Social Security and Medicare -- programs that are dollar-heavy but personnel-light, said John M. Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, an advocacy group for government service. "Government spending does not equal government," said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "So while it hard to come up with an accurate figure as to how much government is still being done, the spending burn rate is not the best way." Our ruling Paul said that "85 percent of government's running right now. Only 15 percent of government spending is shut down." Government shutdowns by nature are somewhat haphazard, so it’s hard at this point to calculate these numbers with any precision. However, due to the big role of entitlement spending in the federal budget, Paul is likely in the ballpark when he measures "government" by the yardstick of spending. However, measuring government in other ways, such as the percentage of federal employees being furloughed in major departments, would make the impact appear bigger. And when he said that "85 percent of government" is operating right now, that’s more of a stretch. Paul’s comment is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-07477	To pay for government growth, leaders of both parties "borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today's $14 trillion debt."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/15/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-leaders-borrowing-4-billion/	Down-to-the-wire budget negotiations may have avoided a federal government shutdown on April 8, 2011, but those dealings are likely only a precursor to even fiercer partisan bickering over whether to raise the national debt ceiling. President Barack Obama's deficit-reduction speech on April 13, and the GOP reaction to it, was the latest salvo. The nation’s current debt is creeping closer to the $14.3 trillion cap allowed by law. By May 16, the national debt could exceed the cap, causing the U.S. to default on its obligations, according to an April 5 memo from U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to Congress. Congress has raised the federal debt ceiling nine times in the past 10 years, according to a January 2011 report from the Congressional Research Service. From 1997 to 2001, the debt ceiling remained steady at $5.9 trillion. In 2002, Congress approved raising the cap to $6.4 trillion and has raised it almost every year since as the debt has grown. Republicans have repeatedly said they will not vote to increase the cap again, unless there are measures to ensure future long-term cuts in spending. Democratic leaders have argued that the increase is necessary to avoid sending an already fragile economy back into a tailspin. On March 30, 2011, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio penned an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal explaining why he does not plan to support raising the debt ceiling. "I will vote to defeat an increase in the debt limit unless it is the last one we ever authorize and is accompanied by a plan for fundamental tax reform, an overhaul of our regulatory structure, a cut to discretionary spending, a balanced-budget amendment, and reforms to save Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid," he said. In the article, Rubio wrote that, "Leaders of both parties have grown our government for decades by spending money we didn't have. To pay for it, they borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today's $14 trillion debt." We were curious if Rubio was correct -- is the U.S. borrowing $4 billion a day to run the government? Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos offered the following explanation in an e-mail as to how the senator arrived at the $4 billion figure. "Our budget deficit this year is roughly $1.5 trillion, according to the Congressional Budgeting Office. 1.5 trillion/365 = roughly $4 billion per day." The explanation seems rather straightforward, but throughout Rubio’s Wall Street Journal piece, there is only mention of the national debt, not the deficit that he uses to calculate the $4 billion figure. While the two terms are linked, they are not interchangeable. So we decided to reach out to several economists to get their expert take on Rubio’s mathematics. First, a primer on the differences between the "national deficit" and the "national debt." The deficit is the result of the government spending more in a single budget year than it takes in as revenue from taxes and other sources. The deficit in 2010 was $1.293 trillion, according to the website of the Office of Management and Budget, and we've had a deficit every year since 2002. Before that, from 1998 to 2001, for a brief period at the end of President Bill Clinton's term and the start of President George W. Bush's administration, the federal government was actually operating with a surplus, according to the Congressional Research Service report previously mentioned. The national debt, meanwhile, is the total amount of money owed by the federal government to creditors who have loaned the government money. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia looked at a similar $4 billion-a-day claim recently and described the debt this way: There are two kinds of federal debt and interest -- the debt held by the public and the total debt. About $9.65 trillion -- yes, trillion -- of that debt is held by the public, which includes individuals, companies and state, local and foreign governments, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The rest, about $4.6 trillion, is held by the Federal Financing Bank, government trust funds, other funds and accounts. The total debt is about $14.25 trillion (as of April 6). The interest on the debt for the federal fiscal year of 2010 was nearly $414 billion, Treasury Department figures show. The national debt stretches back to the founding of the country. It was $75 million in 1791, passed $1 billion in 1862 during the Civil War, and topped $1 trillion for the first time in 1982 during President Ronald Reagan's first term. You can see the federal debt at the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of the Public Debt website. For the yearly federal budget deficits (and occasional surpluses) back to 1901, see the Office of Management and Budget's website. "The debt is the sum of all past deficits," said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness. "When you run a deficit, that adds to your outstanding debt," Snaith explained in a phone interview. The deficit "drives the other one higher. If we didn't run deficits, than we could reduce the debt." Snaith said Rubio’s numbers seemed legitimate, though they likely wouldn’t be routinely used by economists. "The actual borrowing doesn’t occur every day," Snaith explained. "The periodic auction of bonds, that’s when the money is raised. But when you’re dealing with a figure like $1.5 trillion, it’s like a light year, it doesn’t register for many people. To make it a bit more comprehensible, they probably tried to bring it down to a level that is easier to visualize." We also turned to David Denslow, an economist with the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Denslow reminded us of another way the deficit and debt are linked: Every year that we have a deficit, the debt grows larger and we have to pay more interest on that debt. "What we worry about it the accumulating interest," he said in an e-mail, referring to it as a "secondary deficit." He warned, "The effect starts out slow, but becomes explosive." As we noted, interest on the debt was more than $400 billion in 2010. While Denslow agreed with the mathematics behind Rubio’s statement, he still suggested the wording could be clearer. "The phrasing is a bit misleading. I would phrase it, 'To pay for it, they are now borrowing $4 billion a day, raising the debt to $14 trillion,’" Denslow wrote in an e-mail. So two experts agree with Rubio’s $4 billion a day figure but quibble over the phrasing. Still, we wondered if it was accurate to refer to deficit spending "for decades" and justify it with the deficit over the most recent 365 days. After all, using the OMB list of deficits in the past 10 years, it was $3.5 billion a day in 2010, $1.25 billion a day in 2008 and $680 million a day in 2006. We posed the question to Marc Goldwein, policy director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. "In terms of when the deficits were created, of course deficits are the result of a variety of tax and spending decisions -- some which have been made in the last few weeks, some which were made in the 1930s," Goldwein said. "But, when the decision is made is a different question from when the money is borrowed. It is being borrowed now." Goldwein's assessment: Rubio's description "seems to me to be more or less true on average." Again, not quite a ringing endorsement. Rubio's statement was that, to pay for government growth over decades, leaders "borrowed $4 billion a day, leaving us with today's $14 trillion debt." The sentence mixes a breakdown of the deficit and a total for the debt, and the casual reader could easily confuse the two concepts. We think it would have been more accurate to say that leaders "borrowed $4 billion a day last year to cover the deficit, pushing today's debt to $14 trillion." Still, the senator’s calculation works, even though the money isn't really borrowed every single day. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11576	"I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2018/feb/02/bruce-rauner/rauners-dubious-balanced-budget-claims-again/	The Illinois Constitution requires Gov. Bruce Rauner to draw up a budget plan each year that is balanced. But a wide range of fiscal experts agree he didn’t do it in 2015 after taking office. He didn’t do it in 2016. He didn’t do it last year either, even though he claimed otherwise. Indeed, the budget Rauner proposed last year was so clearly billions of dollars out of whack that, when he presented it to the General Assembly last March, PolitiFact Illinois handed the governor the lowest possible Pants on Fire! credibility rating for contending it was in balance. So we were puzzled when Rauner on Monday declared to the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board: "I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor." Rauner followed that on Wednesday during his annual State of the State speech to lawmakers in Springfield with a declaration that unintentionally drew a boisterous round of sarcastic cackling from Democrats in the chamber. "I will submit a balanced budget proposal next month," Rauner said, pausing a couple of beats before adding, "Again." Rauner’s budget proposal for the next fiscal year is still under wraps, so it’s too early to judge whether available revenue will align with expenditures as required by law. But his persistence in arguing that his past budgets were all balanced, despite broad and convincing evidence to the contrary, inspired us to take another look. A broken record Appearing at a mini-debate before the Tribune’s editorial board, Rauner was pressed about his budgeting by his Republican primary challenger, state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton. The incumbent protested that he’d proposed balanced budgets every year. That prompted us to ask the governor’s office if anything had changed in the last year since PolitiFact deemed his claim absurd. A spokesperson emailed back: "Year after year, Governor Rauner has introduced balanced budgets, along with the reforms needed to save taxpayer dollars and put Illinois back on a firm fiscal footing and, year after year, he has been met with resistance from those more comfortable with the status quo. The Governor will continue to push for balanced budgets, pension reform, cutting regulatory red tape, reforms to make our jobs climate competitive, and spending reductions so that Illinois can grow again." In short, Rauner’s office avoided a direct answer to the question we posed. The statement does, however, further a factually challenged narrative that the governor often repeats. There’s history here. Critics say Rauner’s balanced budget boast which earned him a Pants on Fire! in 2017 was no anomaly. "He has never introduced a balanced budget," said Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a Chicago-based think tank partly funded by labor unions. "What he has put out there doesn’t even rise to smoke and mirrors." Martire said the same air of unreality applies to Rauner’s latest statements on the budget. "Maybe in a place where they have unicorns?" Martire said. Last year, in panning Rauner’s claim about his 2017 budget, PolitiFact pointed to some stark numbers that didn’t add up. "Democratic opponents have suggested Rauner’s plan is $4.6 billion to $7 billion out of balance," PolitiFact wrote then. Much of that might have been dismissed as the product of partisan sniping, except for one suspect entry in Rauner’s budget in which he penciled in $4.57 billion in savings for what was described in vague terms as "working together on a grand bargain." The "bargain" in question depended on lawmakers hammering out a broad compromise on a range of spending and ancillary issues including contentious topics like workers’ compensation and tax reform. Rauner ultimately sank the package by withholding support even though he factored its approval into his budget calculations. While the "grand bargain" itself never materialized, attempts at reaching it evolved into a bipartisan effort in the Legislature to break an historic budget stalemate that lasted a total of two years. Last summer, a handful of Republicans crossed the aisle to help override Rauner’s veto of a spending plan authored by Democrats. ‘Pixie dust and magic beans’ After PolitiFact bestowed a Pants on Fire! on Rauner’s earlier budget claim, new information came to light that only served to underscore the rating. In the budget blueprint he proposed last year, Rauner called for creation of a 401(k) style savings plan for newly hired public school teachers and public workers. He estimated that would slice $500 million in savings off the state’s pension costs for fiscal 2018, which began last July 1. Despite the budgetary feuding, the Democratic budget included the 401(k) plan Rauner had asked for. Even so, an investigation by the Better Government Association later raised doubts that any savings from the new retirement program would materialize before 2019 at the earliest. Ironically, Rauner in vetoing the Democrats’ budget faulted them for counting on the same $500 million in savings that he had included in his own spending plan months earlier. Head spinners like that have provided ample fodder for those in Springfield who question Rauner’s credibility when it comes to budget matters. Prominent among the critics is Democratic state Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who issued this statement following the governor’s State of the State address: "We just heard Governor Rauner's re-election speech. Now he has 14 days to deliver a balanced budget that doesn’t involve pixie dust and magic beans." Our ruling Rauner last year earned PolitiFact’s Pants on Fire! rating for his claim that a state budget he proposed was balanced. Indeed, fiscal experts say Rauner has never proposed a balanced budget as required under the state Constitution since taking office in 2015. All facts to the contrary, Rauner repeated a similar claim this week during an appearance at the Chicago Tribune. "I have introduced balanced budgets every year that I’ve been governor," Rauner said. Aides to the governor filibustered when we asked them to back up his latest statement. A year ago, PolitiFact called Rauner out on his balanced budget claim. His most recent comment is equally outrageous. Once again, we rate it Pants on Fire!	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2018-02-02T07:00:00	2018-01-29	['None']
pomt-10841	"In New York, when she ran for reelection, she carried 58 of our 62 counties. George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years earlier."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/10/hillary-clinton/but-ny-numbers-may-not-be-meaningful-elsewhere/	In a recent TV interview, former president Bill Clinton boasted about his wife's vote counts when she ran for re-election. "In New York, when she ran for reelection, she carried 58 of our 62 counties. George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years earlier," he said. He is suggesting Sen. Hillary Clinton's strong reelection showing in Republican-leaning counties in 2006 means she can win nationwide, a key question facing her candidacy. It is true that she carried 58 out of 62 New York counties, and that President George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years before. In the interview, the former president delved further into the numbers from the 2006 race, in which she beat Republican John Spencer by more than 2 to 1. "In the counties that President Bush won, she got a reelection margin of about 60 percent, which means some -- a lot of Republicans and conservative independents voted for her, because they know her now, and they like her, and they saw her in action working for them," he said. That's not far off the mark from what pollsters say about the reasons for Hillary Clinton's strong showing in her 2006 reelection. Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Media Research, says she gained 18 percentage points among independent voters from 2000 to 2006 -- even better than her 15-point gain among moderates. But he and others also attribute the increase to the fact that Mrs. Clinton was a well-known incumbent with a weak Republican challenger. And she also had the advantage of a national wave, fueled by the unpopularity of President Bush and the Republican-led Congress, that propelled Democrats nationwide in 2006 and helped them regain control of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. Mrs. Clinton may not be able to count on moving independents elsewhere. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 47-percent of independents nationally view her unfavorably.

pomt-08117	Eliminating the state tax on health savings accounts will "make it easier for small business owners to provide health insurance to their employees."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-eliminating-state-tax-health-sav/	Governor-elect Scott Walker promises to "open Wisconsin for business" on Jan. 3, with his first official act to be convening an emergency session of the Legislature to consider economic development measures aimed at creating jobs. That package will include a change in state law -- sought by the business community -- that was rebuffed in the past by Gov. Jim Doyle and his fellow Democrats: a state income tax credit for contributions to health saving accounts. Walker included a pledge to eliminate the tax as one of his campaign promises, declaring on his website that the change would "make it easier for small business owners to provide health insurance to their employees." In other words, more health coverage -- even without a mandate from Washington. On Dec. 9, 2010, Walker unveiled some details of his HSA plan -- and again pitched its importance. We had decided days earlier to look at the issue, and had contacted his campaign office about it. So, a special thanks to them for going out of their way to make this item extra timely. During the campaign, as the campaign website shows, Walker positioned the change as a boon to the employers of the state. So that’s our starting point. Some background: Wisconsin is among only four states that do not allow employees to deduct their contributions to health savings accounts. There already is a federal tax deduction available. Supporters see the plans as a key to keeping health care costs under control. Opponents, such as Gov. Jim Doyle, argue that such savings accounts benefit only higher income workers -- and note that the change would cost the state millions in lost tax revenue at a time of huge budget deficits. Health savings accounts are allowed with plans that have deductibles of at least $1,200 for individual and $2,400 for family coverage. With such plans, workers (and employers if they choose to do so) can set aside money into a spending account for employees to use on health care expenses. Many businesses have embraced high-deductible plans, which typically mean lower premiums than on conventional insurance plans. "They’re an important tool" toward keeping the cost of health insurance down, said Jon Rauser, a Milwaukee insurance broker who serves small businesses. What does it mean for those with accounts? On an account with $3,000 in annual contributions, the annual state tax credit would be about $195. Let’s underline: That’s what the employee would receive on his or her tax return. What about the argument, as the Walker campaign advanced, that this would help the bottom line for businesses? Steve Baas, legislative director for the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, says businesses believe the current rules could discourage workers from signing up with a plan that includes a HSA. "It’s incredibly frustrating," he said. "Why are we an outlier on this?" In a letter to its members in spring of 2010, the MMAC in a letter called the lack of a deduction "an unwarranted tax on employees." Walker transition spokesman Cullen Werwie argued allowing HSA contributions to be deducted would put Wisconsin on par with most other states by removing a competitive disadvantage for state businesses. However, neither Werwie nor others involved with the issue said they were aware of any business that was holding off on high deductible plans because of the state tax issue. "Does an employer really care about an employee’s tax situation?" said Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute. "I don’t know if that amount of (tax savings) money makes any difference." Fronstein said about 10 million Americans were covered by health plans that were deemed eligible for HSA accounts. Doyle vetoed versions of the bill in 2004 and 2006. In his 2004 veto message, the governor said he feared that expanded use of HSAs "could decrease employer-sponsored insurance coverage. "Additionally, HSAs are only viable for healthy persons with higher incomes," Doyle wrote. "As healthy individuals with higher incomes opt out of traditional insurance pools, the risk profiles of these existing health plans will worsen, which in turn will cause insurance companies to raise rates on remaining members likely to be those without any other options." It’s a little unclear what the exact cost to the state coffers would be if the tax break was allowed. Doyle noted in 2004 the proposal would cost the state some $38.7 million over eight years; his 2006 veto message put the cost at $50 million but didn’t say over what period of time he was referring to. A version of the bill introduced last spring included a fiscal note that said it would cost $14.8 million in fiscal year 2011. Walker’s announcement Dec. 9 said that under his measure "taxpayers will save $4 million to $8 million in lower taxes if HSAs are tax-exempt." However, those estimates were based on a fiscal note from the 2005 version of the bill. The issue is bigger than the dollar impact of the tax deduction for employees, said John Torinus, retired chairman of Serigraph Corp. who has advised Walker on economic issues. He said the change would "remove a small impediment" to getting workers into high deductible plans and "would send a signal that the state of Wisconsin wants consumer driven health plans." Rauser said when he speaks before companies considering the plans, he has to remind workers that Wisconsin does not allow a tax deduction on the accounts. He termed it "more of a nuisance than an impediment" to getting workers to sign up for them. But again, that’s on the side of the employee, not the employer. State Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), a sponsor of the measures Doyle vetoed and a subsequent bill that died in the last session, said without the break, "employers have trouble convincing their employees (having high deductible plans) is an advantage." HSA plans also lead to more prudent spending on health care because employees use health care providers more prudently, she said, because "they have skin in the game." What’s the bottom line? The consensus is pretty clear: State workers who have health savings accounts are getting nicked by Madison. And allowing them to take a tax deduction would bring Wisconsin in line with most other states. That may all be true. But Walker is arguing that a tax break for individuals -- not employers -- would boost the number of small businesses that provide health insurance. He and other supporters have provided no evidence it would. We rate that statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2010-12-10T09:00:00	2010-12-09	['None']
pomt-08980	He has "ushered in $3 billion in new investment."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/16/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-he-ushered-3-billion-providence-dev/	Rome wasn't built in a day. But Providence was built in just a few short years. By one man. Or so Mayor David Cicilline would like you to think. Since he launched his campaign for Congress, the Providence Democrat, who took office in 2003, has repeatedly taken credit for billions in economic development throughout the city, making it a centerpiece of his election bid. His claim is specific: "By restoring trust in city government, Cicilline has ushered in $3 billion in new investment and restored vibrancy to downtown and the 25 neighborhoods of the city." He's been saying it for nearly five years and it has become a central part of his campaign message. But that's a lot of investment for a city whose entire annual budget was less than $620 million last year. Our interest sufficiently piqued, we called the Cicilline team for a breakdown. A Rose-Colored History After multiple requests, the mayor's administration finally provided us with a list. It was so exhaustive it suggested that Cicilline was responsible for nearly every major piece of Capital City development in the seven years since he took office -- and in a few cases, projects that began before he got near City Hall. Frequented the Auto Zone on Manton Avenue or the expanded fitness center at Brown University? Thank Cicilline. How about the parking garage at Rhode Island Hospital or the Walmart on Charles Street? Or what about the storage units on Reservoir Avenue, or the West River endoscopy offices? The mayor also takes credit for the construction of new condos, retail stores and several not-yet-built office buildings, as well as public projects including work on schools and roads. The list goes on. Over 100 projects in total. The biggest item that he says he "ushered in" is the $610-million I-Way project, the relocation of a portion of Route 195 in downtown Providence. But the I-Way planning began more than a decade ago; the federal environmental impact statement was completed in 1996. The earliest phases of construction began in 1999, three years before Cicilline took office, and the financing came mostly from the federal government. When we asked the Cicilline administration to defend the I-Way claim, they agreed it was an overstatement. Cicilline spokeswoman Karen Watts said in an email that the mayor "agrees with you that including the whole of the highway project in this list isn't correct." But the administration insisted the rest of the list is accurate. What about the combined sewer overflow project, a two-decade effort to build a three-mile long underground tunnel to contain sewage overflow during storms? He takes credit for $275 million of the $359 million development. According to the Narragansett Bay Commission's website, the planning for this project dates to 1993. Construction began in June 2001, more than 18 months before Cicilline took office. The sewer project and the I-Way alone make up almost 30 percent of Cicilline's claim. So even if the rest of the list is valid -- which we don't think it is -- the accuracy of the statement has slipped significantly. "The bigger projects, the 195 and the combined sewer, those were things that were going to happen, but the mayor pushed and got the changes needed [for them]," Providence Planning Director Thomas Deller said in an interview. "....Can we take credit for it? No, it was something that was going to happen. But it may have happened a little faster [with Cicilline as mayor] or a little slower" without him. The problem is that the mayor did take credit for it. He said he "ushered" it in, remember? The Cicilline team argues that while they may not have actually brought in every dollar for every project themselves, they created a predictable, trustworthy environment that made small business owners and developers want to invest there. "The fact of the matter is that [the person] who is in office and who works for them has a lot to do with decisions about how projects move forward," Deller said. "The point the mayor was trying to make is how we work aggressively to make things happen." We don't fault the mayor for claiming credit for hotels or developments such as the new Blue Cross headquarters. In several instances, it's clear his administration played an active role in making those developments happen. But he doesn't deserve credit for every permit issued. It was not a one-time slip of the tongue either. $3 Billion Claim Repeated Cicilline has been using the $3-billion figure at least since January 2006, when he cited it in his State of the City address. In the years since, he has been quoted saying it more than a dozen times in The Providence Journal. The claim came out of the "A Vision For Providence" study, a 2005 report that highlighted economic development, neighborhood by neighborhood. What's interesting is how the claim evolved. In those early mentions, Cicilline said that economic development in the city hit $3 billion. Over the years, the statement morphed into one in which Cicilline took credit for bringing those projects in. And when projects such as the One Ten Westminster condos fell through, the Cicilline administration just replaced that item with another, so the final $3 billion figure never changed. Again, it's fair for a mayor to take credit for some of the economic development that occurred during his tenure. But not to exaggerate his role in those projects. On his campaign website, Cicilline clearly implies that he had a hand in making the developments happen. Not only that, he takes credit for ventures that predate his term in office, and he repeats the claim in public. We presented our research to Deller, a Providence City Hall veteran. At the end of a long conversation, his response: "If this were 2005 and I thought there would be a Truth-O-Meter sometime in the future, I might not have put it that way." That's really all you need to know. False.	None	David Cicilline	None	None	None	2010-07-16T06:00:00	2010-06-28	['None']
pomt-11790	Says Paul Ryan is leading the effort to "pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan" in "another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/22/naral-pro-choice/house-tax-bill-contains-language-about-unborn-chil/	On the morning of Nov. 15, 2017, readers who clicked on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s home page were confronted by a large pop-up ad attacking U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan that linked a Republican tax reform proposal to abortion: The ad was from NARAL Pro-Choice America, formerly the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. If you clicked on an image at the bottom that said "Call Rep. Ryan Now," a link sent you to a page with more information. That page contained a statement that began with this: House Republicans are quickly moving to pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan. This is another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights. Leading the charge has been House Speaker Paul Ryan. NARAL made similar claims on social media. And the group said that, besides Ryan, the online ads targeted eight other House Republicans: Rod Blum of Iowa, Steve Knight and Darrell Issa of California, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Karen Handel of Georgia and Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania. Let’s look at each of the three parts of the attack on Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. 1. ‘Ryan is leading the effort’ The House tax bill was introduced on Nov. 2, 2017, and was approved by the House on Nov. 16, 2017, the day after NARAL’s ad on JSOnline.com. Ryan has long been touting a GOP tax reform proposal, describing it as the first major tax reform since 1986, and promising that its tax cuts and other tax changes would stimulate the economy. A spokeswoman in the speaker’s office told us Ryan supports the provision that is targeted by NARAL, which would change so-called 529 college savings accounts. But she said she wasn’t aware of any public statement Ryan has made on that provision, and we couldn’t find any, which indicates Ryan hasn’t taken the lead on pushing that particular provision. So, this part of the claim is partially accurate. 2. ‘Conception language disguised as savings plan’ People use 529 accounts (529 refers to that section of the tax code) as investment vehicles to save money for college expenses. The savings are for -- as the Internal Revenue Service explains it -- "a designated beneficiary, such as a child or grandchild." A key attraction is that earnings on investments are not subject to federal tax. The House tax bill would allow 529 accounts to be opened explicitly for unborn children. That provision says: Nothing shall prevent an unborn child from being treated as a designated beneficiary or an individual under this section. The term "unborn child" means a child in utero. The term "child in utero" means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb. The provision is "disguised" in the sense that adding the unborn child language doesn’t enable savers to do anything they can’t already do for future children -- a point U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., raised during a hearing. Expectant parents and other savers can already open a 529 in anyone’s name, including their own, and later change the beneficiary -- for instance, after a child is born. Meanwhile, it’s clear the provision is divisive. NARAL is among a number of groups that opposes it; meanwhile, anti-abortion groups support the provision, with one, the Susan B. Anthony List, saying: "It's a small increment in the momentum that we're building to ensure that one day every child is welcomed and protected under the law." So, this part of the claim is mostly on target. 3. ‘Another attempt to ban abortion’ The third part of the claim, however, goes too far. The 529 provision would not ban abortion; it strictly deals with college savings accounts, not any restrictions on abortion. In fact, in announcing its ads, NARAL itself labeled the provision as merely a beginning step, saying: The sole purpose of this provision is to codify the radical, anti-choice idea that life begins at conception into law and begin the process of banning abortion altogether ….This is the first time ‘personhood’ language has made it into tax reform legislation, leaving the door open for future laws to use the same, ideological definition of when life begins … There is evidence that, as the New York Times reported, "the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the recognition of the unborn." The anti-abortion group March for Life said in a statement: "We are heartened to see this bill promote the personhood of an unborn child … and see this as a huge stride toward expanding the child tax credit to recognize life beginning at conception." Snopes fact checked whether the tax provision attempts to codify "fetal personhood" — the legal theory that a fetus has the same legal rights as a person -- and found the claim largely accurate. Two experts, echoing others, told us that inserting an unborn child definition into federal law is part of a broader strategy to limit abortion rights in the future. "It is part of the anti-abortion strategy to work on all fronts to establish fetal personhood/citizenship claims," said Yale Law School professor Mindy Roseman, whose specialties include reproduction rights. The "unborn child" or human "from moment of conception" language is also in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ strategic plan, said University of Wisconsin-Madison law and bioethics professor Alta Charo, whose specialties include reproductive health. Such efforts are aimed, she said, "at building an impression that everywhere in federal law the embryo and fetus is considered morally and perhaps legally equal to a live-born child. It is like building a wall. At the end, abortion stands out as a singular exception, a single missing brick in the wall, and seems harder and harder to justify either morally or constitutionally." Ryan’s response Asked to respond to NARAL’s ad, Ryan’s office referred us to a statement about the provision issued by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The statement says in part: Today, our tax code doesn’t recognize children with eyes, ears, noses, arms, legs, fingers, and heartbeats as children just because they haven’t yet left the womb ….So our tax plan adds clear language that allows parents to start a college savings account before their son or daughter is born by explicitly and unambiguously declaring these sons and daughters "unborn children." Our ruling NARAL says Ryan is leading the effort to "pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan" in "another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights." Ryan is leading the effort to pass the tax bill. But while he supports the college savings plan provision, he hasn’t spoken out publicly to push that provision. Conception language in the provision is divisive among anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups. And it is ‘disguised’ in the sense that it inserts the concept of unborn children into federal law without making any material change to what are known as 529 college savings plans. The provision would not, however, ban or even restrict abortion rights -- although advocates fear that inserting unborn children language into federal law could be used to erode abortion rights in the future. NARAL’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.	None	NARAL Pro-Choice America	None	None	None	2017-11-22T05:00:00	2017-11-15	['None']
pomt-11642	Conservative groups have spent $5 million "against" Tammy Baldwin -- five times more than against all other Democratic U.S. Senate incumbents up for election in 2018 combined.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jan/17/martha-laning/millions-more-spent-defeat-tammy-baldwin-all-other/	Moneywise, the most important U.S. Senate race in the country might be for the seat held by Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin. At least that’s the suggestion from Martha Laning, chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. Laning was interviewed on the "Devil’s Advocates," a liberal radio talk show based in Milwaukee, on Jan. 5, 2018 -- 10 months ahead of the general election. Co-host Dominic Salvia said the Huffington Post reported that conservative groups had already spent $3 million against Baldwin. He asked Laning how Baldwin and the state Democratic Party could counteract that. Laning replied with an even more eye-catching money claim, saying: Well, I want you to know, first, that it's $5 million that's been spent against Tammy -- and it is five times more money spent against Tammy Baldwin, our senator, than all of the other U.S. Senate candidates up in 2018 combined. So, they are coming after Tammy Baldwin like no other. That means Laning is claiming $5 million has been spent against Baldwin -- five times more than has been spent, in total, against all of the other Senate Democrat incumbents who are up for re-election in 2018. The stakes It won’t be known until after the August 2018 primary election which GOP opponent that Baldwin, who was elected in 2012, will face. So far, two suburban Milwaukee Republicans are running: State Sen. Leah Vukmir and political newcomer and former Marine Kevin Nicholson. Including Baldwin, Democrats are defending 25 U.S. Senate seats in 2018 (two seats are held by independents who caucus with the Democrats). The New York Times says it’s a "tossup" as to whether Democrats can wrest control of the chamber from the GOP, which has a two-seat edge. Noting the Huffington Post article that was referenced in Laning’s interview, the political news website Axios made this observation about the Senate races and President Donald Trump: There are 10 Democratic senators [including Baldwin] up for re-election this year in states that Trump won. But if conservative groups’ spending is any indication, Wisconsin might be the hardest seat for Democrats to keep. The numbers The Huffington Post article was based on data collected by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which is based on reports made to the Federal Election Commission. So, we went to the center’s website to produce this breakdown on how much conservative groups have reported spending so far against Baldwin: Expenditures against Baldwin during the 2018 election cycle Group Affiliation Amount Spent Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce Arlington, Va.-based hub for spending by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch $1.66 million Americas PAC Marion, Iowa,-based super PAC $703,500 Restoration PAC Suburban Chicago-based super PAC $527,499 Committee to Defend the President Hybrid PAC/super PAC that supports Donald Trump $130,680 Stars & Stripes Forever PAC Alexandria, Va,.-based super PAC $17,569 Restore American Freedom & Liberty Denver-based hybrid PAC/super PAC $14,000 Conservative Freedom Fighters Denver-based hybrid PAC/super PAC $12,000 Conservative Liberty Coalition Denver-based super PAC $2,000 Wisconsin Right To Life Victory Fund Milwaukee-based super PAC $800 Total $3.07 million By comparison, a total of $599,688 has been spent against other incumbent Senate Democrats (only 12 of the 25 have had groups spend against them, the Center for Responsive Politics told us). So, the $3 million spent against Baldwin is five times as much as has been spent against the other Democrats. But what about the $5 million that Laning claims? To reach that, you have to add in how much conservative groups have spent in support of Nicholson, the GOP newcomer (so far, none have reported expenditures in support of Vukmir). Here’s that breakdown based on the Center for Responsive Politics data: Expenditures for Nicholson during the 2018 election cycle Group Affiliation Amount Spent Restoration PAC Suburban Chicago-based super PAC $1.14 million Americas PAC Marion, Iowa-based super PAC $868,843* Solutions for Wisconsin Austin, Texas-based single-candidate super PAC that supports Nicholson $209,056 John Bolton Super PAC Bolton was U.S. ambassador to United Nations under GOP President George W. Bush $196,860 Club for Growth PAC Anti-tax group $18,568 Club for Growth Action super PAC $11 Total $2.43 million So, if you add what’s been spent in support of Nicholson to what’s been spent against Baldwin, that’s a total of $5.43 million. And that figure is seven times more than the $758,101 that’s been spent against the other Senate Democrat incumbents, or for their opponents, according to the center. It’s worth noting that the pro-Nicholson money, largely for ads promoting his personal background, are not against Baldwin in the same way as the money spent attacking her positions or votes. But the pro-Nicholson money clearly is aimed at helping Nicholson win Baldwin’s seat. A closing note In defending Laning’s statement, the Wisconsin Democratic Party told us that a consultant for Baldwin’s campaign had determined that $5.5 million has been spent on ads directly against Baldwin -- $4.5 million on TV ads and $1 million on web ads. (Baldwin's campaign would not identify the consultant to us.) This approach takes in additional spending, since not all the groups have to report to the Federal Election Commission. But the consultant could not provide a comparable tally for the other Democratic incumbents. Our rating Laning says conservative groups have spent $5 million "against" Baldwin -- five times more than against all other Democratic U.S. Senate incumbents up for election in 2018 combined. Based on reports to the Federal Election Commission that were analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, the total exceeds $5 million and is actually seven times more than what has been spent against the other Democrats. The only caveat is that $3 million has been spent directly attacking Baldwin, while the rest has been spent in support of one of her opponents. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

In a press release Feb. 3, 2010, the state party said that when he was in Congress, McCollum "voted to dismantle Social Security." That's a major charge. The Democrats are not simply saying he voted to reduce the program that provides income for millions of senior citizens, but alleging that he sought to tear it apart. To back up the claim, the Democrats cited nine votes McCollum took related to Social Security in the 1990s. The McCollum campaign doesn't dispute the individual votes but disagrees with how they're being interpreted. "Bill McCollum was always a supporter of Social Security, despite the attempts of Democrats to portray him (and every other Republican) as its enemy,'' wrote McCollum campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell in an e-mail. We examined those votes and showed them to experts on Social Security. We then concluded the Democrats are distorting McCollum's votes and making an incorrect claim based on flimsy evidence. Patricia Dilley, a University of Florida law professor who helped write Social Security legislation in the 1980s, said it was a stretch to describe the votes in such stark terms. "There is not a vote in here directly to dismantle Social Security,'' she said. The Democrats cite these votes by McCollum to support their claim: * McCollum voted in May 1995 for a Republican budget resolution that would have used a lower rate of growth in the Consumer Price Index, which is used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other programs. Some economists have said the CPI overstates inflation, prompting Republican proposals to reduce the growth in the CPI. Henry Aaron, a senior fellow who studies health care for the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said the GOP proposal that McCollum supported would have reduced future benefits -- and reduced the purchasing power of seniors who receive Social Security. But he said "it's not dismantling" the program. * McCollum voted against using the surplus from the overall federal budget to bolster Social Security. The Florida Democratic Party said that, "In the late 1990's, when both the federal budget and Social Security were running surpluses, McCollum voted seven times against using those surpluses to secure Social Security." The party is referring to an initiative by then-President Bill Clinton to set aside the surplus for Social Security -- to put the money in the "lockbox" that became the subject of many jokes (and some funny Saturday Night Live skits) during the 2000 campaign. So the Democrats are alleging that because McCollum didn't want to put the money in their version of a lockbox that it's the equivalent of dismantling the program. Let's examine one of the votes the Democrats cite, a House resolution in May 1999 to do just that. McCollum voted no. But as the McCollum campaign noted, on the same day, he voted for a measure approved by the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats that aimed to make it more difficult for Congress to borrow from the Social Security trust fund surplus to pay for other programs. The vote was supposed to signal the GOP's support for Social Security, even if Republicans didn't want the surpluses used for it. (Republicans preferred using the surplus to provide broad tax cuts.) "He absolutely voted for the lockbox,'' said Campbell. "It was a question of how much he put in the lockbox. Do you put everything in the kitchen sink for the lockbox or do you preserve the trust fund itself. It was the question for two or three years." There's disagreement about the significance of these votes. Aaron said the proposals about lockboxes and securing the surplus were "completely bogus. The surplus of Social Security is secured -- they hold Treasury bonds -- Social Security can cash them in at face value whenever they need the money. I think voting for or against the bills didn't amount to much because Social security reserves are already safe." But Dilley said the lockbox bills could have had some long-term value. "If the lockbox had passed, it would be much more difficult for people to argue we need to cut Social Security to balance the budget,'' Dilley said. "It would have meant people could not now be making the argument we need to address the federal deficit by privatizing or cutting Social Security." Still, we don't see evidence here that the votes were to dismantle the program. They simply reflect different strategies by the parties about what to do with the federal budget surplus. * The Democrats also cite McCollum's votes for $80 billion in tax cuts as "using the Social Security surplus." They contend that McCollum's support of the tax cuts effectively raided the surplus that could have been used for Social Security. McCollum did vote for the tax cuts, but it's a huge leap of logic to equate that with "dismantling" Social Security. Congress tapped the surplus from the general fund, not directly from Social Security accounts. Former U.S. Rep. Clay Shaw, a Republican from Fort Lauderdale who chaired the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, said by the Democrats' logic that "you could make the argument that anything is coming out of Social Security." And contrary to the Democrats' overall point, we found a few articles that mention votes McCollum took to protect Social Security. McCollum even bucked his party to vote for an amendment by Democrat Rep. Barney Frank to protect the program, according to a Jan. 12, 1995, article in Newsday. Frank's amendment was to exempt the Social Security Trust Fund from an amendment to balance the budget. "There should be no temptation to reduce Social Security benefits to achieve the goal of a balanced budget," Frank argued, according to the Newsday article. McCollum was the "lone Republican to vote for Frank's losing proposal. He comes from Florida, which has a large retired population,'' the Newsday article stated. McCollum's campaign also pointed to a 1983 bill McCollum supported that was "to assure the solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds." The Democrats, meanwhile, cited a few news articles with McCollum's comments about George Bush's suggestions during the 2000 presidential campaign to create individual investment accounts for Social Security. That proposal, which would have retained traditional Social Security benefits for older Americans and given younger workers the flexibility to invest the money in different kinds of accounts, was criticized by many Democrats who said it was an effort to dismantle the program. Republicans said they were merely trying to give younger workers more control of their money and an opportunity for higher returns. The Orlando Sentinel quoted McCollum as saying, "I don’t believe in privatizing Social Security. I do believe, however, that the next generation ought to have the right to grow private saving accounts and have a greater savings opportunity than the seniors have had today," McCollum said. But it's important to note that their only evidence about the Bush proposal comes from comments in news stories. They do not cite any votes because the proposal did not come before a vote of the full House. So the Democrats have built a strong charge on flimsy evidence. Yes, McCollum opposed Democratic proposals to use the surplus for Social Security and he wanted to slow the growth in the Consumer Price Index for Social Security and he spoke in favor of Bush's proposal. But it's a ridiculous leap to equate those votes with "dismantling" the program. Pants on Fire!	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2010-03-04T17:16:59	2010-02-03	['None']
pomt-07288	"Gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/may/22/michael-williams/michael-williams-says-gas-prices-are-2-obama-becam/	On Twitter, GOP U.S. Senate hopeful Michael Wiiliams of Texas urged online pals to join him in seeking a national policy encouraging all forms of energy production, writing: "Gas prices have gone up $2 since Obama took office. We need More American Energy." Williams adds on his campaign website: "If I didn’t know better, I’d think President Obama is actually trying to see what $5 gasoline looks like." Energy policy aside, did Williams accurately peg the price of gas on Obama’s watch? After leaving Williams a message, we drilled for price changes since Obama took office in 2009 and during previous presidencies. First, a little perspective: Presidents can’t do anything to lower gas prices in the short term, an energy policy expert at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota recently told WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. In an April 27 post, the station quotes associate professor Elizabeth Wilson saying that the United States doesn’t have a lot of control over prices because "oil is an international commodity, fungible commodity, traded on international markets." Presidents can tap the nation’s strategic oil reserves, which President George W. Bush did in 2005, causing oil prices to drop 10 percent. But, Wilson said, "you could argue that the high prices, while painful, are not potentially strategic reasons to drain the reserves." Or, she said, the president could go after speculators who some blame for driving up the price of oil. Speculative energy contracts have increased 35 percent since the unrest in Egypt began in January; the government could limit the number of contracts big players could purchase, though Wilson said that’s unlikely to have an immediate impact on prices at the pump. Gas prices have caught Obama’s attention. On May 14, he said in his weekly radio address: "Without a doubt, one of the biggest burdens over the last few months has been the price of gasoline." He said he was ordering various governmental moves, including annual lease sales in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve to speed the evaluation of oil and gas resources in the mid and south Atlantic. How much have gas prices gone up since Obama was inaugurated Jan. 20, 2009? That week, the average per-gallon price of unleaded gas in Texas was $1.72, according to the AAA, which tracks prices at the pump by daily surveying more than 100,000 self-service gas stations. It was $3.77 the week of Williams’ tweet--up $2.05. That price was still shy of the July 2008 average of $3.97, the highest average Texas price during predecessor George W. Bush’s presidency, a $2.55 increase from the week Bush began his first term in 2001. In his first two-plus years--the period comparable to where Obama is today-- the average per-gallon Texas price of unleaded gas scarcely shifted, going from $1.42 to $1.47, according to AAA. Next, we looked at national retail prices for all formulations of gas posted online by the EIA. That information, starting from mid-August 1990, suggests that such prices bumped up less than a dime in the comparable part of Bill Clinton’s presidency and about 10 cents in the matching portion of George W. Bush’s first term—compared to about $2.10 for Obama. Another EIA chart shows annual prices for unleaded gas over the five presidencies preceding Obama. Adjusted for 2005-value dollars, the national price went up from $1.74 to $2.06 in the first three years of Jimmy Carter’s presidency; from $2.64 down to $2.15 in that part of Ronald Reagan’s tenure; up from $1.47 to $1.53 for George H.W. Bush; from $1.42 down to $1.41 for Clinton; and up from $1.61 to $1.69 for the second Bush president. Next, we wondered about the cause/effect relationship implied by Williams’ statement. That is, Is it fair to saddle any president with responsibility for the price of gas at the pump? The U.S. Energy Information Administration calls the price of crude oil the "main contributor to the general increase in retail gasoline prices since the start of 2009." Its March 22 post lists several factors affecting the price of crude oil including political events in the Middle East and North Africa, shifts in inventory levels, gradual improvements in the economies of the world and bumps in profits taken by gasoline refiners. Regardless, presidents historically get blamed when the price of gas increases and they aren’t necessarily rewarded when it falls, according to a May 2006 Bloomberg Business Week story. It states that the price-at-the-pump problem has "bedeviled presidents at least since 1973, when the Arab oil embargo created gas lines, a price spiral toward 55 cents per gallon, and an additional headache for President Richard Nixon. Of course, price spikes aren't the sole cause of falling presidential popularity. The relationship is a correlation, and other factors contribute to public perceptions of a president." Our take? Gas costs $2 more per gallon than it did when Obama took office; in the past 35 years, no other president saw such a price surge by this point of his presidency. However, Williams errs by implying the president is at fault; key factors driving gas prices are beyond a president’s control. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02065	The Wisconsin school voucher program "has no research that shows that it’s going to improve student learning."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/may/28/mary-burke/no-evidence-students-voucher-schools-perform-bette/	One way Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke contrasts herself with Gov. Scott Walker is with the state's school voucher program, which uses public money to pay for lower-income children to attend private schools. With his 2013-’15 state budget, Walker expanded the voucher program, also known as school choice, by opening it to a limited number of students outside of Milwaukee and Racine. Burke, a Madison School Board member, opposes the expansion. Speaking to the Milwaukee Rotary Club on May 6, 2014, she elaborated on why, saying: "What I want to see is initiatives and programs that are actually based on research and success that’s going to improve education, instead of saying that, well, our answer is just to roll out a voucher program that actually has no research that shows that it’s going to improve student learning." This debate has been engaged many times before. So let's see what we know about research into the performance of public vs. voucher school students. Vouchers and their expansion Vouchers in Wisconsin date to 1989, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and a Democratic-majority Legislature created the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, the nation's first urban school voucher program of its kind in the country. Under the original law, the number of vouchers was limited to 1 percent of the enrollment in Milwaukee Public Schools. And only non-sectarian private schools in the city were eligible to take choice students. Choice started with about 300 students in the 1990-’91 school year. The program has since been expanded several times -- more than 25,000 students now participate -- with the two most recent expansions occurring under Walker: Expansion of school vouchers in Wisconsin 1995: Religious schools can participate; voucher limit raised to 15 percent of Milwaukee Public Schools enrollment 2005: Voucher limit raised to 22,500 MPS students 2011: Voucher limit eliminated; income eligibility raised; private schools outside Milwaukee can accept Milwaukee choice students; Racine-area students and schools are made eligible 2013: On limited basis, vouchers available to students outside of Milwaukee and Racine Now let’s look at data on the performance of public vs voucher students. Test scores and Arkansas research In assessing Burke’s claim, it’s important to note there are limited ways to compare the performance of voucher vs public school students. Wisconsin does not require voucher schools to publicly disclose measures such as retention rates, graduation rates or college-entrance exam scores. As we reported in an April 2013 article on competing claims about voucher schools, and as we found in doing additional research for this article, there are two primary measures of vouchers in Wisconsin: 1. Annual statewide test scores reported in 2011 through 2014; and 2. A study by researchers based at the University of Arkansas that tracked the test scores of particular choice and Milwaukee Public Schools students over five years, ending in 2011. 1. Here’s how public and voucher students compared on statewide test scores: 2011: In first direct comparison involving statewide tests, students in Milwaukee Public Schools performed better than or about the same as voucher students in reading and math 2012 and 2013: Students attending public schools were more proficient, as a group, than their private school-choice counterparts in Milwaukee and Racine in reading and math 2014: On average, MPS students performed higher than Milwaukee choice students in reading and math. Racine public school students also scored higher on math and reading proficiency than Racine voucher students. An April 2014 report from the Public Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research group in Milwaukee, shows that from 2010-’11 through 2012-’13, Milwaukee Public Schools students outperformed voucher students at every grade level (third through 10th grades) on the statewide reading and math tests. So, overall, four years worth of publicly available, annual state test scores give a clear edge to public school students over voucher students. 2. Arkansas research The Arkansas research, meanwhile, took a different approach. Its "longitudinal" study tracked representative samples of 2,727 Milwaukee choice students and 2,727 Milwaukee Public Schools for five years, from the 2006-’07 through 2010-’11 school years. Key findings: Growth in math achievement was similar in all years, while voucher students made gains in reading in 2010-'11 that were higher than students in the Milwaukee Public Schools sample. Milwaukee students enrolling in a private high school in the choice program "increases the likelihood of a student graduating from high school, enrolling in a four-year college and persisting in college by 4 to 7 percentage points." It’s important to note that the reading advantage was for just one year, and the Arkansas researchers cautioned that some evidence suggested it was due to the introduction of a new state testing requirement for private choice schools. University of Arkansas education reform professor Patrick Wolf told us there's no way to know whether the reading improvement was due to the voucher schools themselves or other factors, such as teachers preparing their students more for the annual test because 2011 was the first year that voucher schools had to publicly disclose their test scores. On the high school finding, a majority of students who were enrolled in private choice schools in the ninth grade were no longer in a choice school by the time they reached 12th grade. The results, therefore, should be interpreted as the effect of "exposure" to choice schools rather than long-term persistence in that sector, the Arkansas study found. Wolf said that while there is no overall evidence that voucher schools improved learning in Milwaukee, for Burke to say there is no evidence "is a bit of a stretch," given what the Arkansas research found. Before we close, we’ll note two other studies that indicate voucher schools have an indirect impact on student learning. One study was done in 2003 by an economics professor then at Harvard University and one was done in 2008 by an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The studies said competition from voucher schools were linked with improved performance of students in Milwaukee Public Schools. For example, the 2003 study found that test scores in math, science, social studies, language and reading increased more in MPS schools where at least two-thirds of students were eligible for vouchers. Our rating Burke said the Wisconsin voucher program "has no research that shows that it’s going to improve student learning." Public school students consistently outperformed voucher students on statewide test scores from 2011 to 2014. The one study held up by choice advocates shows only limited instances in which voucher students performed better, and the study couldn't determine whether the voucher schools themselves or other factors were the reason. Burke goes too far in saying there is no evidence that vouchers improve student learning, but the evidence is thin. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-06555	Says "Every year air pollution protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/oct/03/earl-blumenauer/earl-blumenauer-says-delaying-air-pollution-rules-/	Even in these cynical, partisan days, there are some universal truths. For example: Sulfur dioxide is a pollutant that can severely affect a person’s health and, in extreme cases, be fatal. Nitrogen oxide is another common and nasty pollutant that makes people sick. Scientists and non-scientists as well as Republicans and Democrats generally agree the stuff is bad for you. But how you deal with it is where agreement ends -- at least in Congress. On the House floor Sept. 23, Republicans muscled through legislation that would delay or scrap rules to reduce mercury and other harmful air emissions, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Though the bill passed, it’s highly unlikely to pass the Senate and would be vetoed by President Barack Obama if it did. Nevertheless, the House debate was lively. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., was one of the loudest critics, insisting that delaying the tougher air pollution rules would have dire results. "Every year these protections are delayed, another 34,000 people will die prematurely," he said. Really? That’s a lot of dead bodies and it’s very specific. Perfect for PolitiFact. First, some background. As passed on a nearly party-line vote of 249-169, the bill would, among other things, require the president to set up a committee of Cabinet-level officials to evaluate the toll that a dozen-plus Environmental Protection Agency regulations would have on jobs, electricity, gasoline prices and competitiveness. Republicans said action was needed to slow down a runaway bureaucracy. "While there are reasonable regulations that protect our children and help keep our environment clean, we need to stop unelected bureaucrats from imposing excessive regulations that unnecessarily increase costs for consumers and make it harder for our economy to create jobs," House Speaker John Boehner said. Blumenauer and other Democrats said the bill was a craven gift to business that would result in dirtier air and more death. Blumenauer’s dire prediction was directed at the bill’s delay of something called the Cross‐State Air Pollution Rule which would limit the amount of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide belching from power plants in 27 states. The pollutants react in the atmosphere to create ground-level ozone and set free tiny particulates that can damage lung capacity and cause respiratory problems. In real numbers, the EPA says the rules would reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide from the plants by 6.4 million tons a year (from 8.8 million tons in 2005) and to 1.4 million tons a year of nitrogen oxide (from 2.6 million tons annually in 2005). Those are big numbers and Blumenauer argued Sept. 22 during floor debate that lawmakers voting for the bill would be directly responsible for making people sick. "The losers are hundreds of thousands of people (who) will die, get illness from cancer, asthma, lost school days, millions of lost work days, the lost quality of life that is documented beyond belief," he said. "This is real, and these people lose." Blumenauer’s aides said he was relying on studies conducted by the EPA to support his claim. The most authoritative of those studies is a 414-page analysis released in June. The dense title suggests it’s a product of science rather than sound-byte politicians: "Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Federal Implementation Plans to Reduce Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone in 27 States; Correction of SIP Approvals for 22 States." The report relied on the work of EPA scientists and a survey of independent, peer-reviewed studies by outside scientists. And there, listed among the "key findings" is this: "The benefits result primarily from 13,000 to 34,000 fewer (particulate matter) and ozone-related premature mortalities." The report repeats the number eight more times. We find that Blumenauer was on solid ground. But he also cherry-picked the highest death number rather than using the range of 13,000 to 34,000 additional deaths. While that omission does not change the conclusion that air pollution is bad for public health, it could exaggerate the problem. For that reason, we rate this claim: Mostly True.

pomt-06601	Says U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin is backing President Barack Obama’s plan to pass a $1.5 trillion tax increase.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/23/national-republican-senatorial-committee/republican-group-says-rep-tammy-baldwin-backs-15-t/	When President Barack Obama unveiled a long-term deficit-reduction plan on Sept. 19, 2011, top congressional Republicans dismissed it as a stunt featuring $1.5 trillion in tax increases leaning heavily on the wealthy. While Obama’s plan has little chance in the GOP-controlled House, it did give Republicans more fodder to rail against Democrats for insisting on tax hikes -- and to tie Democrats to Obama’s sinking poll numbers. One of the targets was U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for the seat that Sen. Herb Kohl, a fellow Democrat, will vacate after 2012. The messenger was the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), a campaign arm of the GOP that issued similar news releases going after Democratic Senate candidates in states including Virginia, Florida, Montana, Missouri and New Mexico. "Today, as Baldwin continues to double down on her support of the failed first stimulus and the rest of his tax-and-spend policies, President Obama proposed the largest tax hike in U.S. history – a $1.5 trillion tax increase on investors and small businesses that he says is needed to pay for their reckless spending agenda...," the NRSC news release said. Here’s the part of the release that caught our eye (italics ours) -- a quote from NRSC spokesman Chris Bond: "Under the Obama-Baldwin economic record, America has lost 2.4 million jobs, the federal debt has skyrocketed past $14.6 trillion, government spending has grown to record levels, and the response from Obama and Baldwin is to pass a record tax increase on the backs of Wisconsin small businesses," the release said. Did Baldwin, who recently launched her Senate bid, really come out in favor of a $1.5 trillion tax increase? When we asked Bond for evidence, he pointed to: Baldwin’s press statement on Sept. 8, 2011 expressing support after Obama’s speech that night. In his address, the president focused on the $447 billion American Jobs Act. Baldwin’s comments in favor of the Jobs Act on Sept. 17, 2011 at a Madison rally dubbed "Fighting Bob Fest" after Progressive icon Robert La Follette. The Jobs Act is separate from Obama’s broader "Long-Term Deficit Reduction Plan," which would raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for the jobs bill and help fund a 10-year drive to reduce federal deficits by some $3 trillion. The president touted the principles of that plan in the same speech where the Jobs Act was unveiled but did not lay out the details until Sept. 19, 2011. That announcement was what prompted the NRSC release -- and where the timing gets interesting. Bond said because the Jobs Act and Obama’s long term deficit reduction plan were linked in the initial speech and have somewhat overlapping funding sources, it’s fair to say Baldwin supports the White House’s deficit-reduction plan and the $1.5 trillion in tax increases to pay for it. "This is one big policy rollout that they are doing," Bond said. Let’s look at the record. Baldwin indeed praised the Jobs Act -- specifically Obama’s focus on creating construction jobs to erect public infrastructure so America doesn’t "sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads." Baldwin’s press statement the night of the president’s speech on jobs and deficits was both broad (praising his call for "bold action") and specific (citing the Jobs Act infrastructure plan). The middle class, Baldwin said, "is taking it on the chin in both the economic and political environments." Her comments came before and after Obama announced tax hikes to pay for the Jobs Act -- but two days before Obama released the specific and much longer list of tax hikes in his Long-Term Deficit Reduction plan. Those are the ones that tally out to $1.5 trillion. We could not find any public comments by Baldwin in favor of the large package of tax hikes -- the one the NRSC says Baldwin is backing. We asked Bond if he had evidence that Baldwin was specifically endorsing the tax package. "I haven’t seen any politician say that," he told us. "She hasn’t done it." Baldwin’s campaign confirmed this in an email: "While Tammy Baldwin applauds the President’s plan to create jobs, she hasn’t taken a position on the (deficit-plan) revenue package and is concerned about some of the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid that have been proposed." Obama’s deficit plan drew public praise from some liberal Democrats, especially the new minimum tax rate for individuals making more than $1 million a year, the so-called Warren Buffett rule. There was an undercurrent of caution among Democrats, though, with some saying they wanted to see details to ensure Medicare and Medicaid were protected. Our conclusion The NRSC contended that Baldwin backed $1.5 trillion in tax hikes in Obama’s 10-year deficit plan. Republicans certainly have a case that Baldwin prefers what Obama calls a "balanced" approach to deficit fighting -- revenue hikes along with spending cuts. She may ultimately side with many of Obama’s ideas, which were sent to the congressional "super committee" that is to propose a major debt plan late this year. But the NRSC itself acknowledges Baldwin has not endorsed Obama’s deficit plan, which is a much broader proposal than the Jobs Act. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13781	"There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/20/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-there-are-more-hoosiers-going-work/	In his first major speech as the 2016 Republican vice presidential nominee, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence repeated a talking point about his economic record back home. "There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before," Pence said. That’s similar to a comment Pence had made just over a week earlier, shortly before Trump chose him as his running mate. The statistic isn’t as meaningful as it sounds. Pence has a point that more people in Indiana are working today than at any time in history -- 3.07 million in May 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s a chart showing BLS data for Indiana as far back as the database goes online: However, the historical peak Pence cites has more to do with long-term population growth than with the robustness of the economy. Economists agree that the most accurate way to analyze a statement like this is to look at the percentage of people working, not the raw number. Otherwise, you could say that President Barack Obama at the depths of the Great Recession was presiding over a healthier job market than Ronald Reagan in his second term, because 25 percent more Americans were working. The difference was that the base U.S. population -- rather than job prospects -- grew substantially in the interim. As a general rule, "focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading," Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed, told us when we looked at Pence’s earlier comment. Let’s take a look at what happens if you calculate the percentage of the Indiana population that is working. According to the Census Bureau’s 2015 population estimate — the most recent one available — Indiana has a population of about 6.48 million. So 47.3 percent of Indiana residents were working this year. By contrast, at the previous raw-number peak in Indiana employment -- May 2000 -- there were 3.02 million residents working. That year, the state had 6.08 million residents, so the percentage working was 49.7 percent. In other words, a bigger percentage of Indiana’s population was working in 2000 than in 2016. That throws some cold water on Pence’s assertion. These calculations use all Indiana residents as a baseline, regardless of age, but the same pattern holds if you just look at Indiana residents between the ages of 18 and 64, the prime working years. Currently, 75.4 percent of Indiana residents in that age range are working. In 2000, the comparable figure was 80.5 percent. So by this measure, too, Pence is wrong about 2016 representing a historical peak. Then there’s the more traditional measure of the health of the job market, the unemployment rate. This statistic uses as its baseline the number of people who are looking for a job, which makes it even more precise and in most cases more useful to economists. Indiana’s current unemployment rate of 5 percent is what experts would generally consider good, but it’s hardly a historical low for Indiana. For most of the time between 1993 and 2008, Indiana’s unemployment was right around 5 percent and often even lower. Here’s a chart going back to 1976: Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, noticed another pattern in the numbers. He used federal data to determine that even though the state’s working-age population grew by 311,000 between 2000 and 2015, the number of people actually working in the state increased by far less over that period -- only 45,400. That does not seem like an obvious sign of a strong employment trend. Our ruling Pence said, "There are more Hoosiers going to work than ever before." Literally, more Indiana residents are employed now than at any time in the past. But it’s a data point with very little meaning, since, as any statistician will tell you, it doesn’t take into account the size of the state’s population. Looking instead at the percentage of Hoosiers working shows that the percentage was higher during the previous employment peak in 2000. And the widely used unemployment rate — which is even more precise because it is based on the number of residents who are actively looking for a job — has been lower than its current rate over long stretches of recent history. We rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2078352d-5a91-4bdf-9872-462839fd76b5	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2016-07-20T23:07:32	2016-07-20	['None']
pomt-03928	"More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single Moderate on their ballot."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/22/kenneth-block/block-says-moderate-party-has-lots-votes/	Rhode Island was among 14 states in the last election cycle that allowed voters to use the so-called "master lever," enabling them to vote for candidates from one political party with one ballot mark. On Rhode Island ballots, it is the option called Straight Party. Kenneth Block, founder and chairman of the Moderate Party of Rhode Island, has launched a campaign to get rid of the master lever, saying it’s outdated and creates confusion for many voters. In a recent appearance on the "State of the State" television program, Block said that in the November 2012 election, "More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single Moderate on their ballot." Block, a businessman, gathered enough signatures to get on the ballot in 2010 as the Moderate Party’s candidate for governor. He came in last in a four-way race, with 6.5 percent of the votes. But that was enough to win a spot on the 2012 and 2014 ballots for his party. We wanted to know how Block calculated that 9,000 figure. By e-mail, Block said that he started with 9,424 -- the number of people he said voted by the master lever for the Moderate Party. Then he did some estimating, based in part on the size of the communities and districts with a Moderate candidate on the ballot. He noted that the Moderate Party had a candidate in just three communities -- Burrillville, East Greenwich and South Kingstown -- and two legislative districts -- House District 65, in East Providence, and Senate District 16, which is all of Central Falls and a piece of Pawtucket. Block then estimated the number of voters he thought would have cast a straight-party Moderate vote in those communities and districts. He subtracted that estimated total from the total of all Rhode Island voters who selected the Moderate Party with one ballot mark. He didn’t provide an exact final number -- just "more than 9,000." When we checked Block’s number, we discovered he was close, but not directly on target. To begin with, both the secretary of state’s office and the Board of Elections said the number of Moderate Party straight-party votes was actually 9,295 -- not the 9,424 Block started with. Then we obtained exact numbers of master-lever votes for the Moderate Party in the communities and districts with Moderates on the ballot . Miguel J. Nunez, planning specialist at the Board of Elections, told us there were 208 such votes in Burrillville, where a Moderate candidate was running for School Committee. But that race was non-partisan and the candidates weren’t identified by party so, technically, it doesn’t fit Block’s definition. In the other communities and legislative districts with identified Moderate candidates on the ballot, there were a total of 642 master-lever votes cast for the party. Subtract that number from the 9,295 statewide votes and you get 8,653 -- close to 350 fewer than Block’s "more than 9,000." Even if you add the 208 votes from Burrillville, you still don’t get to 9,000. Our ruling Kenneth Block said, "More than 9,000 Rhode Island voters used the Moderate Party master lever mechanism and they didn't have a single moderate on their ballot." He derived that number in part from guesswork. But according to the precise figures from the Board of Elections, he was off by nearly 350 -- roughly 4 percent. But Block’s underlying point that the master lever confuses many voters is valid. More than 8,000 used it to vote for Moderate Party candidates when there weren’t any on their ballots. For those reasons, we rule his claim Mostly True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-14049	"Look, we are at war with these people and they don't wear uniforms. … This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-letting-tens-thousands-terror/	Donald Trump has advocated for a "temporary" ban on Muslims coming into the United States to prevent any terrorists from crossing the border. But are there already tens of thousands of terrorists coming into the country now? That’s what he claimed in an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. "Look, we are at war with these people, and they don't wear uniforms," Trump said during the May 23, 2016, interview. "It's not your traditional war where it's a war against Germany, Japan, or whoever. This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now." As with some previous Trump comments we’ve analyzed, this remark is all over the place, making it hard to parse. And the Trump campaign did not get back to us to clarify what he meant. Still, we decided to take a closer look. On the one hand, by referring to "vicious, violent people," Trump seems to be referring to terrorists and violent extremists. But there is no evidence that tens of thousands of terrorists are being admitted into the United States today -- much less that they are being "allowed" in, as if there is a visa preference program for terrorists. On the other hand, Trump is in the numerical ballpark if he’s referring to the number of refugees being admitted into the United States every year -- something else he’s expressed reservations about. Currently, the United States accepts 70,000 refugees from around the world -- not just the Middle East -- and that number is poised to grow to 100,000 in 2017 due to scheduled increases from Syria and Iraq. However, this would mean that Trump is saying that all or nearly all refugees are terrorists, including the many who are not even Muslim and who don’t come from the Middle East. This is decidedly not the case, experts agreed. "Donald Trump is conflating the terrorists with those who flee terror," said Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS, originally known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. "We are not letting in terrorists, we are letting in refugees from terror. His likening refugees to terrorists is not unlike those who said German Jews from Nazi Germany should be denied immigration because they posed a security risk." Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that is critical of illegal immigration, speculated that when Trump was referring to "tens of thousands" he may have been conflating the number of refugees and the much larger population of undocumented immigrants, and also conflating run-of-the-mill violent criminals with terrorists. "It is correct to say there are tens of thousands of violent criminal aliens," Camarota said. "But remember the total noncitizen population who could be subject to removal is huge, and in any human population of this size there will always be tens of thousands who are criminals." Of course, even if Trump’s statement could be manhandled into an interpretation that possessed some degree of accuracy, it was still wrong as he stated it. "Trump is certainly wrong on the facts here," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. That said, Gartenstein-Ross added that more reasonable concerns could have been expressed with less "hyperbolic" rhetoric. The recent migrant flows from Syria and Iraq into Europe, he said, have provided greater cover for terrorists than experts had predicted early on, and while the United States is not facing as much risk from its ongoing inflow of refugees, that risk is not zero. Just going by the math, some small fraction of refugees can be expected to either be well-concealed operatives who made it through the screening process or, much more likely, people who self-radicalize after arriving in the United States. Still, Gartenstein-Ross agreed that there is no evidence that "tens of thousands of them" are already here, as Trump said. Our ruling Trump said, "Look, we are at war with these people and they don't wear uniforms. … This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now." There is no evidence that "tens of thousands" of terrorists are coming into the United States, much less that they are being "allowed" in on purpose. While there may be legitimate counter-terrorism concerns about refugee flows, Trump’s overheated rhetoric complicates rather than clarifies the situation.

pomt-08089	"When Social Security was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits," just as there have been in the legal battle over the new health care law.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-compares-legal-battle-over-health-car/	During a White House interview with Tampa's WFLA-TV on Dec. 13, 2010, President Barack Obama reacted to a decision earlier that day to strike down a key portion of the health care law passed earlier this year. In the recently announced ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson of Virginia declared unconstitutional the law's requirement that individuals purchase health insurance or face a penalty. In the interview, Keith Cate, an anchor at NBC affiliate News Channel 8, asked the president for his thoughts on the ruling. Obama began by noting that other lower courts had issued more favorable rulings, and that the issue was destined to go through additional legal steps on its way to the Supreme Court. "That's the nature of these things," Obama said. "When Social Security was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits. When the Civil Rights Act was passed and the Voting Rights Act was passed, there were all kinds of lawsuits." In this item, we'll focus on the Social Security Act, in part because we thought we'd give the president a second chance after earning a False from us on a different comment about the early history of Social Security. It turns out that in his second historical comment, the president was accurate. Even though American society was less litigious in the 1930s, the creation of Social Security -- which is a landmark moment in the history of the federal government -- did attract not just one lawsuit that reached the Supreme Court, but three. And as we looked deeper into the history of the legal battle over Social Security, the more we noticed how much its details echo the battle playing out now over the health care law. So we'll provide an overview of the history here, in which we rely heavily on by an official history of the period written in 1999 by Social Security Administration historian Larry DeWitt. "Even though the Social Security Act was enacted into law on August 14, 1935, the country still had to hear from the Supreme Court," DeWitt wrote. "This was a new, untested area of federal authority and it was inevitable that it would be challenged in the courts, and until the Supreme Court ruled, no one could be sure that the nascent Social Security Act would survive its infancy." DeWitt noted that under the 10th Amendment, powers not given to the federal government are left to the states or the people, so the federal government, in its defense of the Social Security Act, would have to find justification in the Constitution for the expansion of its powers. Even before the Social Security Act was passed, other parts of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal -- the cluster of programs designed to alleviate the Great Depression -- had been subject to legal attacks and in some cases were ruled unconstitutional by lower courts for overstepping federal powers, just as one of the requirements of the health care law has been. In 1935 and 1936, a sharply divided Supreme Court -- split between three liberals, four conservatives and two swing votes -- invalidated the Railroad Retirement Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The defeat of three pillars of the New Deal drove Roosevelt to propose, in early 1937, an ill-fated "court-packing" scheme in which he would expand the number of justices, thus shifting the court's ideological complexion in his direction. The proposal was soundly defeated by Congress, with significant collateral damage to Roosevelt's standing with the public and historians. But beginning in March 1937, one of the swing justices, Owen Roberts, shifted from the opponents' camp to become a supporter of New Deal programs, enabling a minimum wage law, the National Labor Relations Act and the Social Security Act to stand. Three specific cases attacking Social Security reached the Supreme Court. In one, the Steward Machine Company case, the company sued over having to pay unemployment insurance tax under the law. Another case, Carmichael vs. Southern Coal & Coke Co. and Gulf States Paper, challenged a different facet of the unemployment provision having to do with the states. But the most directly relevant for Obama's comment was Helvering vs. Davis, in which George P. Davis, a minority stockholder in an electric company, objected to being forced to pay the payroll tax that funded the old-age insurance program. The administration, represented by Internal Revenue Service commissioner Guy T. Helvering, filed suit to force compliance. "The attorneys for Davis argued that the payroll tax was a new type of tax not listed in the Constitution's tally of taxes, and so it was unconstitutional," DeWitt wrote. "At one point they even introduced into their argument the definitions of 'taxes' from dictionaries in 1788 (the year before the Constitution was ratified) to prove how earnest they were in the belief that powers not explicitly granted in 1789 could not be created in 1935. Davis was also of the view that providing for the general welfare of the aged was a power reserved to the states." This sounds to us a lot like some of the arguments in the health care case, which revolves around the question of whether the federal government is justified in imposing a tax-based penalty on Americans who refuse to sign up for health care coverage. The high court handed down its decision on May 24, 1937. Reflecting a divisive debate in Congress and among the justices, the Court upheld the unemployment-insurance provision by a narrow, 5-4 vote. But in the old-age insurance, the Roosevelt administration won a resounding 7-2 victory, without even a written dissent by the dissenters. In his majority opinion in Helvering vs. Davis, Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote that the Great Depression was a national problem that demanded national solutions. "The ill is all one or at least not greatly different whether men are thrown out of work because there is no longer work to do or because the disabilities of age make them incapable of doing it," Cardozo wrote. "Rescue becomes necessary irrespective of the cause. The hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journey's end is near." Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that Obama has a point that there are similarities between the legal battle over Social Security and the fight over the health care law. "Like the Affordable Care Act, the Social Security Act was subject to constitutional challenges, lower courts reached conflicting conclusions, and the issue was not resolved until the cases reached the Supreme Court," he said. If the recent past is any guide, the court that eventually takes up the health care law, led by another Justice Roberts, will also be one with a close ideological divide. Of course, there are limits to the comparison. "The fact that there are all kinds of lawsuits challenging X, which was eventually upheld, obviously does not mean that every other law that is challenged by all kinds of lawsuits will also be eventually upheld," said Stuart Taylor, a veteran commentator on the Supreme Court. Taylor added that while many of the broader themes are similar, the specific legal arguments are not identical. "The issue at the heart of the health care individual mandate -- whether the government can, in the name of regulating interstate commerce, require individuals to buy a commercial product simply because they were born and they live in this country -- was raised neither by the Social Security cases nor by any other case in the nation's history," Taylor said. "Also, while one can plausibly defend the individual mandate's enforcement provision as a tax in support of the general welfare, like the Social Security tax, that argument is somewhat undermined by the facts that the President and Congress strenuously denied that the mandate is a tax in order to get it passed and that the law itself was changed to call it a penalty, not a tax." So, Obama's comparison is not exact. But there are some striking similarities, so -- unlike in our previous item -- we think the president was justified in making the broad comparison. And on the narrow question of whether "there were all kinds of lawsuits" when Social Security was passed, we rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-00972	Alabamians "haven’t changed their opinion" on same-sex marriage since voting to ban it in 2006.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/13/roy-moore/alabama-chief-justice-roy-moore-81-percent-alabami/	CNN’s Chris Cuomo challenged Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore to defend a decision that will allow local courts to ignore a federal judge’s ruling striking down the state’s anti-gay marriage law. "Times have changed as they did with slavery," Cuomo said Feb. 12 on New Day. "The population no longer feels the same way. And even in your state, people no longer feel the same way." Moore held firm that marriage was defined as between a man and a woman, and said, "81 percent as recently as 2006 said it was the definition. They haven’t changed their opinion." Support for gay marriage has increased nationwide significantly in just the last decade. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2006, 55 percent of Americans opposed gay marriage. By 2014, 52 percent supported marriage rights for same-sex couples, and opposition was down to 40 percent. But has there been no movement on the issue in Alabama, as Moore claimed? We decided to take a look. In June 2006, voters in Alabama overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment barring authorities from issuing marriage licenses to "parties of the same sex." The referendum passed with 81 percent of the vote. Moore’s office confirmed that was the number he was alluding to. What has happened since then? Being a solidly red state, and a rural one at that, Alabama is not surveyed as often as some other states. But here’s what we found from the polls that do exist. In 2012, a poll of likely voters by the Capital Survey Research Center — an arm of the Alabama Education Association and one of the most consistent pollsters in the state until it recently closed — found 71 percent opposed same-sex marriage. Likely voters would be those most expected to show up for an off-year primary election, as was the case when the referendum passed in 2006. So by that measure, while gay marriage remains deeply unpopular in the state, there was a 10 percentage point decrease in opposition. That drop in Alabama is largely in line with the slope of the decline in opposition at the national level. During the same time frame, nationwide opposition to gay marriage fell to 46 percent in 2012 from 55 percent in 2006, according to Pew. It’s not a perfect comparison to look at the 2006 Alabama referendum, which asked people to vote on a constitutional ban on gay marriage, and a 2012 survey that queried voters on whether they support gay marriage. For example, some people might have opposed gay marriage but didn’t think a constitutional amendment was necessary. But it’s a measurable change in sentiment on the overall topic that is backed up by other research. In 2005, 87 percent of registered voters told the Capital Survey Research Center that they supported the position of, "Allowing only traditional marriage between a man and a woman." But an Alabama television station found in 2015 that 70 percent of registered voters oppose gay marriage. Finally, the Williams Institute at UCLA estimated marriage opinions for every state in 2004 and 2012 based on each state’s demographics in those years. How was this accomplished? They took the demographic make-up (age, religion, race, etc.) of each state and compared it against national survey data that broke down sentiments about marriage by those demographics. Researchers took this approach because lack of polling data in many states made it difficult to spot trends. What they found was support for gay marriage in Alabama grew from 16 percent in 2004 to 32 percent in 2012. Alabama’s increase of 16 percentage points was actually larger than the national average (13.5 percentage point increase), though the starting point there was much, much lower than most states. And that’s an important point to note: Alabama was among the states with the lowest support for gay marriage in 2004 and it remains among the lowest today. By the Williams Institute’s estimate, only Arkansas and Louisiana have a fewer percentage of citizens supportive of gay marriage (31 percent). That result is echoed by the Public Religion Research Institute, which found that Alabama and Mississippi in 2014 had the lowest support for same-sex marriage among their populations at 32 percent. Our ruling Moore said since voters passed a constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage in 2006, Alabamians "haven’t changed their opinion." An overwhelming number of people still oppose same-sex marriage in Alabama, and it remains one of the least-supportive states of gay marriage, according to the information available. But polling data suggests measurable movement on this issue. In 2006, 81 percent of voters supported the referendum to prohibit gay marriage in Alabama. Recent polls show about 71 percent of likely voters oppose same-sex marriage today. That’s in line with other data that show growing support for same-sex marriage in the last decade there, and is similar to the rate of decline in opposition nationally. The statement contains partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Roy Moore	None	None	None	2015-02-13T15:57:39	2015-02-12	['None']
pomt-13002	"Republicans Looking To Cut Social Security As Much As 50 percent Immediately."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/14/new-century-times/website-makes-dubious-claim-gop-will-cut-social-se/	A newly introduced bill to overhaul Social Security has prompted a wave of urgent appeals to current and future Social Security beneficiaries to prevent the program from being gutted. A reader noticed an Internet post being widely shared and asked us if it was accurate. The post in question, from a website called the New Century Times, is headlined, "Republicans Looking To Cut Social Security As Much As 50% Immediately." A 50 percent monthly benefit cut starting "immediately" would indeed be a serious problem for a lot of Social Security beneficiaries. However, the primary article the post linked to doesn’t support the headline, and a related article provides only weak support. The New Century Times post links to a column by Josh Marshall, the editor and publisher of the liberal news and commentary website Talking Points Memo. The column analyzes a bill offered by Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, that would raise the retirement age for Americans 49 or younger from 67 to 69, change the formula for determining a beneficiary’s first payments, and effectively reduce their future cost-of-living adjustments. "Republicans apparently aren’t going to be satisfied with phasing out Medicare," Marshall wrote. "They’re going to try to pass huge cuts to Social Security this year too. Not Bush-style partial phase-out, but just big, big cuts. And you’re out of luck even if you’re a current beneficiary." But Marshall’s column doesn’t say the cuts will be "50 percent immediately," and the New Century Times article never provides any other backing for it. (A side note: The author of the New Century Times article is Sarah Wood, who is the creator of a satirical website called the Free Wood Post. However, she writes separately for the New Century Times, according to her Twitter biography, and we have no reason to believe that the Social Security article is intended as satire. Wood did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Adding to the confusion, the New Century Times separately quotes a statement by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that says the Johnson bill "cuts benefits by more than a third" -- not 50 percent. We didn’t hear back from Johnson’s staff, but we did find a different Talking Points Memo piece that could be the source of the 50 percent figure. This article offers a number of scenarios exploring how the Johnson bill could affect particular beneficiaries, depending on how much income they make, when they retire and how long they live. A number of the examples in the Talking Points Memo article show increases well below 50 percent. "A 65-year-old retiree (who earned an average of $12,280 and) was only in the workforce for 20 years would see a 19 percent decrease … in 2030," the article said. "That cut would be 32 percent, if the 65-year-old was retiring in 2050." Some examples even show increases. "A 65-year-old who made an average of $12,280 ... after being in the workforce for 30 years would see his benefits increase by 9 percent when he retired in 2030, as compared to the current law," the article said. But some examples do show decreases in excess of 50 percent. Specifically, the Talking Points Memo article says, "a 65-year-old at the top of the scale, a $118,500 average earner, would see his benefits cut by 25 percent when he retired in 2030, compared to the current law, and that reduction would grow to 55 percent compared to current law by the time the retiree was 85 years old. Likewise, those cuts get larger the longer the law is in place. The 65 year-old at the top of scale who retires in 2050 will see a 43 percent cut in his benefits, compared to current law, that will grow to a 74 percent reduction by the time he is 85." Clearly, cuts of 55 percent or 74 percent are significant. But a lot of important context was lost between the Talking Points Memo article and the New Century Times headline that got so much attention on social media feeds. First, these are very specific examples; many other beneficiaries would experience far less severe effects. The New Century Times headline leaves the impression that this would be an across-the-board cut. Second, these specific examples happen to be clustered among new retirees at the top of the income scale, meaning they would be more able to afford the cuts. Some low earners, as we saw, actually come out ahead in the calculations. Third, these cuts would be about as far from "immediate" as one can imagine. No one currently receiving Social Security or about to start receiving benefits would experience a 50 percent benefit cut -- the most logical way to read the headline. Rather, in the example with the 55 percent cut, that would take full effect in 2050. In the example with the 74 percent cut, that would take full effect in 2070. For a sense of context, lots of Gen-Xers would have reached, or would soon reach, 100 years old by 2070. Our ruling A widely shared New Century Times post was headlined, "Republicans Looking To Cut Social Security As Much As 50% Immediately." A recently released bill would indeed raise the retirement age and make changes to Social Security formulas that would effectively cut future benefits for many recipients. But by highlighting cuts as large as 50 percent without noting that these are for a specific (and affluent) subset of beneficiaries, the headline engages in extreme cherry picking. And none of these massive cuts would happen immediately -- they would happen 34 and 54 years in the future. This claim revives a well-honed Social Security scare tactic. We rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5ef38fa7-f951-465a-ac7e-c170748999e2	None	New Century Times	None	None	None	2016-12-14T17:12:54	2016-12-09	['None']
pomt-00217	The 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches "are going up."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/oct/12/stephen-carter/no-5-4-supreme-court-rulings-are-not-rise/	Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s seating on the Supreme Court followed one of the most bitter and divisive confirmation fights in the High Court’s history. Some legal commentators suggested that, in addition to questions of Kavanaugh’s personal history and judicial temperament, the Supreme Court’s own internal dynamics helped intensify the fight over the vacant seat. "One of the reasons I think we fight so hard is you look at the number of 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches. Those are going up," said Yale Law professor Stephen Carter. "The more those decisions go up, the more valuable each seat is, each vacancy." There may be a public perception that 5-4 decisions are up, perhaps owing to blockbuster rulings in recent years on everything from health care to voting rights to political spending that were decided by this slimmest of margins. It’s also possible that Kavanaugh could cast deciding votes on cases with major implications for American society. But the data shows that 5-4 decisions are not trending upward. Not trending up We reached out to Carter, who said he’d misspoken. "Mea culpa. I do know better," he said of his Oct. 10 appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. "When I talk about this subject to students and colleagues, I usually refer to the perception that there are lots of 5-4 decisions as the driver of perceived value of each vacancy." To be sure, many high profile cases have been decided on a 5-4 basis in recent years. The most recent term also had a higher rate of 5-4 decisions than the previous two terms. However, there’s no discernible long-term upward trend, according to a SCOTUSBlog analysis of past 13 terms, as well as interviews with Supreme Court watchers: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "I don’t think there’s a particular trend there," said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "I don’t think it’s accurate to say that the rate of 5-4 decisions is increasing." What about ‘big’ cases? Not all cases the justices hear are equal, of course. Each year, some cases carry greater potential impact and public interest than others. Experts told us that when charting the relative frequency of 5-4 decisions over time, there’s no objective way to separate the (for lack of better term) major cases from minor cases. However, Sara Benesh, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, said blockbuster cases do tend to produce less consensus than minor ones. But that’s nothing new, she said. "It is true that ‘big,’ controversial cases are more likely to be decided 5-4 than more ‘routine’ cases," she said. "But that has been true over time as well." Oftentimes those divisions break along familiar ideological lines. Justice Elena Kagan, an Obama appointee, addressed the Court’s voting breakdown in a recent speech. She said the Court’s relatively high frequency of 9-0 opinions is underappreciated, but acknowledged that big cases often do produce more disagreement. "There are some issues — some important issues that people care about — in which the court is more closely divided and tends to be divided along lines that you might predict, if you look at who nominated each of us," she said. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Overall, the rate of 9-0 decisions have outnumbered the rate of 5-4 decisions in recent years, according to Sarah Turberville of the government watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, who provided the following chart: "It’s not entirely accurate to say 5-4 decisions have increased," Turberville said. "Yes, there was an increase from 2016 to 2017, but there was also an increase in 9-0 decisions over that course of time." Our ruling Carter said that the 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches "are going up." The most recent Supreme Court term had a higher rate of 5-4 decisions than the previous two terms. However, the data since at least 2005 shows 5-4 decisions are not trending upward. Carter himself said he misspoke, and meant to say there was a perception that such cases were on the rise.

pomt-06574	Says only four Texas legislators voted against a law giving in-state tuition rates to certain illegal immigrants.	true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/28/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-only-four-texas-lawmakers-opposed-/	Under fire recently for his stance on giving in-state college tuition rates to illegal immigrants in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry stated that in 2001, only four Texas legislators voted against the measure. The statement came as Perry apologized in a Sept. 28, 2011, interview with Newsmax TV for saying anyone who opposed giving tuition breaks to the children of illegal immigrants did not "have a heart" — a comment he made in the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate. In an article about the interview, though, Newsmax noted that Perry stood by his view that the decision in his state to extend tuition breaks was the right one. "I was probably a bit over-passionate by using that word, and it was inappropriate," Perry was quoted as saying. "In Texas, in 2001, we had 181 members of the Legislature — only four voted against this piece of legislation — because it wasn't about immigration, it was about education." Only four of the 181 members voted no? We’ve written other items about this law in recent days, so our interest was piqued. (We checked statements about whether Perry gave illegal immigrants in-state rates and the difference in dollars between in-state and out-of-state tuition.) According to the journals for the 2001 session kept by the Texas House and Senate, Perry is darned close. Versions of the proposal cleared House and Senate education panels with no opposition. The House passed the measure 142-1, with Rep. Will Hartnett, R-Dallas, being the lone "no" vote; five House members were absent, according to the April 23, 2001, House Journal entry. After amending the bill, the Senate approved it 27-3 on May 21, 2001, with Republicans Mike Jackson of La Porte, Jane Nelson of Flower Mound and Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in opposition. Three days later, the House approved the Senate's changes 130-2; the "no" voters were Hartnett and Rep. Jerry Madden, R-Richardson. Sixteen members were not present. Perry signed the measure into law June 16, 2001. Our count: Five of the 181 legislators referred to by Perry (31 state senators, 150 House members) voted against the tuition legislation. That's close enough for us to rate his claim True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-09-28T18:49:23	2011-09-28	['Texas']
pomt-02459	Says Alex Sink supported "higher property taxes."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/feb/24/republican-party-florida/alex-sink-supported-higher-property-taxes-florida-/	Alex Sink’s campaign for Pinellas County’s open U.S. House seat has been under attack by Republicans resurrecting her positions on Florida taxes over the years. One such claim is rooted in Sink’s record as the state’s chief financial officer. A Republican Party of Florida campaign mailer that reached Pinellas County homes by Feb. 10 accused her of leaving out "some key facts" in one of her TV ads. The flier read, "Alex Sink supported higher taxes. She has a long record of supporting higher taxes -- higher property taxes, higher sales taxes, even higher taxes on water and TV." We’ve checked many of these claims before; we found the sales tax attack Mostly False, and the water and TV taxes claim Mostly True. But what about the property taxes? Back on the homestead The GOP said it was basing their accusation on a Jan. 23, 2008, story in the Tampa Bay Times in which then-CFO Sink voiced her opposition to Amendment 1, a ballot measure focusing on how the state’s homestead exemption would be applied to property taxes. The amendment aimed to increase the exemption, saving homeowners an average of $240 on property taxes annually. It also allowed homeowners to transfer their tax benefits under the 1992 Save Our Homes Amendment, which capped assessment increases on homes, to a new residence. The amendment further created a new $25,000 exemption for some business properties and limited assessment increases for non-homesteaded properties to 10 percent annually. In the story, Sink was briefly mentioned as not supporting the measure because she was afraid of the potential loss of services that might happen if tax revenues fell. Specifically, she mentioned firefighters losing jobs, because they are paid with property taxes. She said her constituents largely shared her opposition. "They're really more concerned about the little amount of money (they would get back) and the possible broader implications for our quality of life," Sink said. The GOP did not make any reference to a statement Sink made a day earlier, which clarified her stance on the measure. "For 20 dollars a month, I'm not willing to take the risk that my fire service is going to be deteriorated, my schools aren't going to be supported, and I'm not going to get my potholes fixed," Sink told the Times Jan. 22, 2008, prior to the article Republicans cited. The piece noted that as Florida’s fire marshal, a role the CFO assumes, she was hearing from fire chiefs statewide that they were worried about losing firefighters. Fire agencies relied solely on ad valorem taxes for their budgets. She said in the piece that she shared the views of Florida TaxWatch, which opposed Amendment 1. She also noted she didn’t think tax policy should be a part of the state Constitution. "If the policy's in the Constitution and it's not working right, how do you unwind it?" Sink added. Her public position on the measure, which passed on Jan. 29, 2008, with 64 percent of the vote, came up in June 2009 when she spoke before the Latin Builders Association in Miami to ramp up her campaign for governor. She said then that she couldn’t recall how she voted on the amendment, drawing criticism from conservatives. Combined with a plunging real estate market during the Great Recession, the amendment led to a precipitous drop in tax revenues statewide. The expanded homestead exemption alone, which was retroactive to Jan. 1, 2008, took $93 billion out of coffers statewide in the first year, according to state records. The resultant budget cuts did eventually force many fire agencies to institute hiring freezes or cut personnel, including first responders, and delay or kill equipment purchases and capital improvements. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida says Sink supported "higher property taxes," referring to her somewhat lukewarm opposition to 2008’s Save Our Homes Amendment 1, which adjusted property taxes in a way that lowered them for most homeowners. The claim is misleading in that it implies to voters she wanted to raise property taxes across the board. That wasn’t the case; Sink wanted to keep taxes at the same level, not raise them. There’s an element of truth here, but it leaves out context that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03822	Says bag litter increased after San Francisco banned single-use shopping bags.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/mar/20/drew-springer/drew-springer-says-bag-litter-increased-after-san-/	Austin’s ban on disposable shopping bags is "all for show," according to freshman state Rep. Drew Springer. "In San Francisco, litter from bags actually increased after enacting their ban," he said in a press release issued March 5, the day he introduced his "Shopping Bag Freedom Act." Springer, a Republican from the North Texas town of Muenster, said he filed House Bill 2416 to stop Texas cities from ruling that businesses can’t give customers single-use plastic or paper bags. Brownsville, South Padre Island and Fort Stockton also have bag bans, and a Dallas City Council member wants "to follow in Austin’s footsteps." After Austin’s ban went into effect March 1, 2013, retailers could no longer offer thin, so-called single-use plastic and paper bags at checkout counters. The City Council passed it in 2012, saying the plastic bags, in particular, often end up as litter and are costly to clean up. And did bag litter rise after the San Fran ban? San Francisco’s 2007 ordinance banning single-use plastic bags at certain stores was the first such U.S. law, according to a March 28, 2007, San Francisco Chronicle news story. In November 2007, large grocery stores had to stop giving out single-use plastic bags; six months later, large chain pharmacies had to comply, the story said. Springer’s chief of staff, Travis McCormick, said by email that the lawmaker’s statement was based on the City of San Francisco Street Litter Re-Audit conducted in April-May 2008, which showed that plastic retail bags constituted 0.64 percent of all large litter (items more than 4 square inches). That was a 6.7 percent increase over the 0.6 percent share shown in the city’s April-May 2007 audit, McCormick said, so there was a slight bump in such litter despite the ban. San Francisco environmental department spokesman Guillermo Rodriguez told us by phone that retail plastic bag litter dropped the following year. He emailed us the city’s 2009 study, which showed plastic retail bags accounted for 0.52 percent of large litter. We looked over the city’s three litter audits, for 2007 through 2009, and here’s the thing: We’re talking about differences of about two plastic bags in each year’s litter samples. For the audits, observers counted pieces of litter at more than 100 sites, classified the found items as large or small, then tallied them in dozens of subcategories. In 2007, they recorded 23 plastic retail bags and pieces of such bags across all the checked sites. They found 25.5 of the bags and pieces of bags in 2008 -- and 23.5 in 2009. Those counts match up with the percentages McCormick cited and the percentage in the 2009 report. About half of San Francisco’s large litter in each audit came from "fiber materials" such as paper, cardboard and napkins. The "second-most significant material type" was plastic, accounting for 20 percent to 24 percent of total large litter in the surveys. In each of the three years, the largest category of plastic was "miscellaneous," accounting for 4.7 percent to 9 percent of all large litter and defined as "litter that is broken up or weathered such that auditors cannot identify it with certainty but can identify the litter as plastic." Raw numbers of large litter items in San Francisco 2009 audit Source: The City of San Francisco Streets Litter Re-Audit 2009 Rodriguez called the 2009 audit "a better snapshot" of the ban’s effects primarily because the 2008 audit was conducted only a few months after the ban started to take effect in November 2007. The 2008 litter audit counted litter samples taken from April 7 to April 18, 2008. That would have been before large pharmacies had to stop giving out disposable plastic bags on May 20, 2008, according to a Chronicle news story published that day. Finally, because Springer’s claim referred to "litter from bags," we looked at San Francisco’s total bag data even though the city’s ban did not address paper bags. In contrast, Austin’s City Council banned both plastic and paper bags except for bags considered reusable -- such as ones with handles. Overall bag litter in San Francisco followed the same pattern as plastic retail bag litter -- rising in 2008 before falling below the 2007 and 2008 levels in 2009 (measured as a percentage of total large litter). Specifically, all paper and plastic bags made up 4.45 percent of large litter in 2007, 5.91 percent in 2008 and 4.22 percent in 2009. That’s a 33 percent increase in 2008; then the 2008 percentage dropped 28.6 percent in 2009. As of October 2012, San Francisco barred all retailers, large and small, from providing single-use plastic bags, according to other Chronicle news stories and news blog entries. Also, the city began requiring retailers to charge a 10-cent fee for each other bag they give out. Both requirements will apply to restaurants starting in October 2013. Our ruling Springer said San Francisco’s "litter from bags actually increased after enacting their ban" on plastic bags. A litter audit conducted before the ban took full effect found two more retail plastic bags than the previous year’s sampling. However, the next audit, launched after the ban had been fully in place for nearly a year, saw a two-bag drop. Maybe this means that such litter is decreasing, though we would want more research to reach definitive conclusions. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

pomt-08890	"Only a few months ago the FBI arrested three Broward County Commissioners for accepting millions of dollars in trade for illegal favors."	false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/30/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-says-three-broward-county-commissioners-a/	Arrests of public officials in South Florida have been common headlines in recent years. We've been witness to all sorts of drama including a school board member sticking cold hard cash in a doggie bag and later made famous by a photo of her running away from the cameras, a county commissioner receiving money in a golf bag and later crying at the courthouse, and an ex-city commissioner who once resolved a spat at Winn-Dixie with a gun and was later defiant at his sentencing in a corruption probe. All three of those officials hailed from Broward County -- a place where perhaps the most common question among observers and critics of politicians is, "Whose next?" Republican Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, who is running for attorney general, wants such government corruption stopped. But does Kottkamp have his facts right on which government officials had the handcuffs slapped on them for which crimes? On the morning of July 30, we looked at Kottkamp's campaign website and found his position paper on "Stopping Government Corruption" in which he vows to crack down on officials who violate the public's trust. Kottkamp wrote: "Only a few months ago the FBI arrested three Broward County Commissioners for accepting millions of dollars in trade for illegal favors. This rash of public corruption lead the Governor to petition the Florida Supreme Court to empanel a grand jury to investigate corruption in South Florida. I support this effort as a necessary first step to restore public confidence in government." For this claim, we will evaluate that first sentence in three parts: Were three Broward County Commisisoners arrested by the FBI? Did the three accept millions of dollars? And were the arrests a few months ago? We started with the Broward County Commission. So far, the feds have arrested only one Broward County Commissioner -- Josephus Eggelletion on Sept. 23, 2009 -- in a scheme in which he participated in laundering about $900,000 and profited about $23,000. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. In March, a tearful Eggelletion was sentenced to 30 months in prison. In July, the Broward State Attorney's Office announced the arrest of Broward County Commissioner Diana Wasserman-Rubin for seven counts of unlawful compensation, but the FBI was not involved. Prosecutors have accused her of repeatedly voting on grants that benefitted her husband who received $45,000 in bonuses. She has denied wrongdoing and has not had her first court hearing. But Eggelletion wasn't the only Broward notable to land in prison this year. On the same day that federal prosecutors announced their case against Eggelletion, they unveiled charges against School Board Member Beverly Gallagher (the doggie bag/dashing away from the press politician) and former Miramar City Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman who was later defiant at his sentencing. Here is the press release that summarizes the separate charges in the Broward cases. Gallagher pleaded guilty to bribery for accepting about $9,000 from undercover agents posing as consultants trying to get school district business. In June she was sentenced to 37 months in prison. Salesman was convicted of bribery and extortion at trial for taking $3,340 from undercover agents who were trying to get business from the city of Miramar. Salesman was sentenced in July to 51 months in prison. So there clearly weren't three Broward County commissioners busted by the FBI -- only one Broward county commissioner was arrested by the feds. Or another way of looking at it: two politicians in Broward and a former politician in Broward were convicted after federal corruption probes -- none of which involved the convicts pocketing anywhere close to millions. But there were three Palm Beach County commissioners -- the county immediately to the north of Broward -- who were convicted in federal corruption probes between 2007 and 2009: Tony Masilotti, Warren Newell and Mary McCarty. There were also a list of other public officials in Broward -- including two on the Deerfield City Commission and a Davie town manager -- who have been charged with corruption in recent years. We spoke with Kottkamp campaign manager Jill Gran and spokesman David Bishop at about 10:40 a.m. July 30, 2010, and told them we thought the claim was wrong. "We didn't write it, by the way," Gran said. It was written by a researcher in conjunction with Kottkamp, she said. Bishop said they would look into it and if it was wrong they would correct it. Bishop sent us an e-mail less than two hours later saying they had made a mistake. "Our error was calling them Broward County commissioners when we should have said Broward County elected officials and then distinguish between county commissioner, school board member and former Miramar City commissioner. That has now been corrected on the website. It’s clear from the FBI news release that large sums of money were being transferred for illegal activity. That is why the issue paper says million[s] of dollars. We spoke with Bishop to ask him to clarify the "millions" part of the original claim. He pointed to the press release from the U.S. Attorney's office announcing the arrests, which stated about Eggelletion and his co-defendants (two businessmen and an attorney) "in a series of wire transfers, the defendants laundered approximately $900,000 from an account in Miami through the Bahamian account into an account controlled by the FBI in St. Croix. As well, the UCAs [undercover agents] discussed an additional $200,000 and $500,000 transfer with Eggelletion and [Ronald] Owens, respectively, but none of these additional funds was actually transferred." Bishop said: "Eggelletion may have only gotten $23,000 out of this but acted in conjunction with co-conspirators in attempting to defraud $900,000 and discussed $200,000 and $500,000. I can see where that can be confusing so we changed that as well." When the Kottkamp campaign changed the sentence on the website July 30, here is how they wrote it: "In September 2009, the FBI arrested a Broward County Commissioner, Broward County School Board Member and former Miramar City Commissioner on corruption charges." Note the campaign took out the "millions'' remark. The way they have it written now is accurate. "We acknowledge the mistake,'' Bishop said. "It was brought to our attention, and we fixed it as quickly as we could." In South Florida we've had quite a few public officials get arrested in recent years so we can understand how the average person could mix some of them up. (We think it would be fun and handy if someone would create trading cards to help the public keep their corrupt politicians straight.) But there has been extensive news coverage, press releases and court records on these cases making it easy for a high-profile candidate to get the facts right when summarizing in a sentence. So did Kottkamp get anything right here? Well there was one Broward County commissioner arrested by the FBI, but he did not accept millions -- though he was involved in laundering about $900,000. But Kottkamp did at least get one element of his sentence right: the timing of the arrests. Bishop said that the page was initially posted in February 2010 -- that was a few months after the September arrests of Eggelletion, Gallagher and Salesman. In total, Kottkamp's claim -- up on his website for about six months -- was wrong. Only time will tell if any other members of the Broward County Commission get arrested. Kottkamp's staff gets kudos for fixing it promptly, but it was wrong since February. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11040	"Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they've been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don't have high powered attorneys."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/jun/29/ted-lieu/do-more-450000-americans-sit-jail-because-they-are/	A California Democrat responded to news of Paul Manafort’s pretrial jailing by pointing out that many other Americans suffer the same fate, due to a simple lack of money. Responding to an appearance by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz on Fox & Friends in which Dershowitz called the pretrial jailing of Paul Manafort "unfair," U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu took to Twitter to point out how pretrial detention affects the poor. "Dear @AlanDersh: I hope you will work with us on bail reform. Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they've been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don't have high powered attorneys," Lieu tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Various media outlets and experts in the field have referred to a figure of 450,000 Americans when discussing the scope of the problems with bail. However, we wanted to figure out where Lieu got his numbers from, so we did some digging of our own. Ultimately, we found that the number in Lieu’s tweet is an overestimate of the number of Americans who are in jail because they can’t afford to pay bail. In addition, the statistic Lieu is referring to is not one that is kept nationally. In other words, no accurate count exists of the amount of people in jail in America who are too poor to pay bail, so there’s no way to fully verify Lieu’s claim. The real meaning of "over 450,000" We reached out to Lieu’s office and asked where they got the number of 450,000 Americans from. As evidence, Jenna Bushnell, Lieu’s communication director, cited a Marshall Project article and Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the latter of which discloses that there were 458,600 unconvicted inmates in local jails at the end of 2016. There’s just one problem: that’s not the statistic that Lieu is describing in the tweet. In his tweet, Lieu equates the Americans who "are in jail not because they’ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail" with the 458,600 count from the BJS report. However, the BJS statistic is a count of the total number of Americans who were detained and held in jail before their trials. That count includes those who can’t afford to pay bail, but it also includes other groups of people who are in jail before trial for different reasons. Included within that "over 450,000" statistic are people who are not bailable, like those being held without any bail, meaning that no amount of money paid would result in their release. In other words, Lieu’s tweet is an overestimation of the number of Americans who are too poor to bail their way out of jail. And there are still other groups included in the 458,600 figure. "The unconvicted population in jails can also include mentally-ill persons awaiting commitment to a mental-health facility," Darren Hutchinson, a University of Florida professor, told us. Lauryn Gouldin, an Associate Professor of Law at Syracuse University, said that it’s also important to distinguish between judges who make informed, intentional decisions about setting high bails, and judges who are more careless in their decisions. "Judges setting bail may be oblivious to the financial circumstances of those who end up detained (so is it ignorance/judicial accident that leads to detention) or judges may deliberately set high bails to assure detention for those they believe are high public safety/flight risks," Gouldin said. Because the BJS data only distinguishes "convicted" from "unconvicted" members of the jail population, there’s no way Lieu would know the exact number of how many people are in jail because they’re too poor to pay bail. Although the data on how many people can’t afford to pay bail is scarce, the experts we spoke to pointed to some resources that were the best data available. Gouldin cited a Vera Institute of Justice study that said nine out of 10 felony defendants are unable to afford the bail amount set by the judge. Meanwhile, Insha Rahman, a program director at the Vera Institute of Justice, pointed to two studies that locally analyzed how many people were being detained pretrial due to an inability to pay bail. In all three studies, a majority of the pretrial detainees were in jail because they could not afford to pay their bail. However, both Gouldin and Rahman cautioned against generalizing the results of these studies to the national unconvicted jail population. "I think the tweet is about as accurate as our scandalous lack of attention to what we are doing in the criminal system allows," Alec Karakatsanis, the founder and Executive Director of Civil Rights Corps, said. Gouldin concurred, saying "It would be great if we had more information about exactly how many of the (458,600 unconvicted Americans)...spend time in jail because they can’t afford bail. I think there is more attention being paid to the fact that we don’t have this information we should have." Our ruling Lieu tweeted, "Every day over 450,000 Americans sit in jail not because they’ve been convicted of anything, but because they are too poor to pay bail & don’t have high powered attorneys." The 450,000 number counts how many people are detained before their trials each year in America. However, Lieu uses it incorrectly here: included in that number are not only unconvicted inmates who are too poor to pay bail, but also unconvicted inmates who are being detained preventively and held without any bail. Experts confirmed that there is no national figure keeping track of how many unconvicted inmates are unable to pay bail. That said, the point of Lieu’s tweet—that some Americans languish in jail without ever being proven guilty—is largely accurate. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-09257	"At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/03/katrina-vanden-heuvel/vanden-heuvel-claims-energy-industry-isnt-investin/	With thousands of gallons of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico, conversation on the May 2, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week quickly turned to U.S. energy policy. Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of The Nation, argued that one way to prevent such spills in the future is to transition to a clean energy economy -- which she said will be difficult given how little energy companies invest in research and development. "At the moment, energy companies spend 0.25 percent on R&D. We can do better. We are a nation which should do better ... and not rely on dirty energy, which just compounds the problem affecting this country and the planet," vanden Heuvel said. We thought that would be a relatively easy statistic to track down, but it led to a wild op-ed goose chase. Vanden Heuvel told us she got the information from a David Brooks column in the New York Times last week. His April 29 column lamented the minuscule amount of funding energy companies invest in R&D compared with other industries. "Technology companies spend 5 percent to 15 percent of revenue on research and development," he wrote. "Energy companies, on the other hand, spend only one-quarter of 1 percent. The federal government spends $30 billion on health research, but only $3 billion on clean energy research." But that, in turn, came from another opinion article: Brooks' assistant told us that he got it from an op-ed by Bill Gates and Chad Holliday, former chairman of DuPont, published a week earlier in the Washington Post. Here's what the duo wrote: "Our country is neglecting a field central to our national prospect and security: energy. Although the information technology and pharmaceutical industries spend 5 to 15 percent of their revenue on research and development each year, U.S. companies' spending on energy R&D has averaged only about one-quarter of 1 percent of revenue over the past 15 years." The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to our request for more background on the claim. But we found two sources that indicate vanden Heuvel is very close: A report published by the Brookings Institution last year shows the energy industry output in 2003 was about $1.2 trillion, and it spent about $2.4 billion on research and development -- about 0.2 percent of the industry's total output. Data from the National Science Foundation published in the federal Statistical Abstract of the United States shows the petroleum and coal products industry spent about 0.3 percent of its net sales on research and development in 2007, the most recent year available. According to the same data, R&D spending has hovered around 0.3 percent for several years. We also ran vanden Heuvel's claim by two experts who told us that it's pretty accurate. "It's close to correct," said Nate Lewis, a professor at California Institute of Technology who assisted on the Brookings Institution report. "As a percent of revenue, (the amount the energy industry spends on R&D) is a really small number. The pharmaceutical and intelligence industries spend between 10 and 12 percent on R&D. We're not even in the same ballpark here." So, even though vanden Heuvel was relying on another pundit for her claim (and he, in turn, was relying on an op-ed), the number is very close to numbers published by Brookings and the National Science Foundation. We find her claim True.	None	Katrina vanden Heuvel	None	None	None	2010-05-03T18:46:32	2010-05-02	['None']
pomt-12307	"Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/23/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-claim-seven-years-later-scott-walker-ha/	U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan blasted Gov. Scott Walker’s ability to keep his No.1 campaign promise during the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s annual convention. Pocan, D-Madison, attacked Walker and Republican lawmakers on job growth and other issues during his 15-minute speech, at one point focusing on the governor’s failed 2010 campaign promise to add 250,000 private-sector jobs within his first term. "Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs," Pocan said halfway through his June 2, 2017 speech. The convention took place as state Democrats seek to ramp up support among its base before the 2018 mid-term elections. Walker is expected to be on the ballot again, seeking a third term. So the promise is likely to come up again … and again. Here, we’ll briefly revisit Walker’s original promise, and see where the jobs tally currently stands. The promise In 2010, Walker first sought the governor’s office on the promise that he would bring 250,000 private-sector jobs to Wisconsin by the end of his first term. "(Scott Walker will) get government out of the way of employers ... who will then help Wisconsin create 250,000 jobs by 2015, and as we create those new jobs, we will be able to add 10,000 new businesses," his campaign said at the time. For the years 2011 through 2014, Wisconsin added 130,153 private-sector jobs, meaning Walker fell short of his first-term promise by about 100,000 jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. For this tally, we used the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which surveys nearly all state businesses, to get the most accurate picture for Walker's years in office. We made comparisons using the fourth quarter reports from the QCEW. On the Walk-O-Meter, which we use to track the governor’s campaign promises, we rated Walker’s pledge as a Promise Broken when economists said in September 2014 that it was impossible to reach his the target by the end of his first term. The picture since Wisconsin’s economy has continued to add jobs throughout Walker’s second term, but at a much slower pace. The fourth quarter numbers for 2015 and 2016 from the BLS show Wisconsin added 38,077 and 11,548 jobs respectively. The 2016 growth numbers were the worst during Walker’s tenure and the worst since the economy rebounded after the 2008-’09 recession. In total, Wisconsin has added a total of 179,778 private sector jobs during Walker’s near seven years as governor, which puts him 70,000 short of the pledged 250,000 new jobs. Pocan spokesman David Kolovson said in an email that the congressman’s claim was based on a March 12, 2017 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story, which stated the governor’s promise "remains elusive." The Journal Sentinel story listed the total number of jobs under Walker as 185,208, which differs from the total offered here because that article was published before the BLS released final numbers covering the end of 2016. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson also pointed to the same story and Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development numbers, saying in email "we don’t have anything to add." "Wisconsin’s business climate has consistently improved from one of the worst in the nation to one of the best under Governor Walker, and our state’s economy is in the best shape it’s been in 16 years," Evenson said quoted as saying in the March story. "We’ve seen more people employed than ever before, wages are up, and Wisconsin’s labor force participation rate continues to be one of the best in the country." And yet, the topic of job creation under Walker lingers. President Donald Trump ran on the platform of being a jobs president, famously saying "I’ll be the greatest jobs president God ever created." In a June 13, 2017 visit to Wisconsin, President Donald Trump hinted at a major manufacturer locating to Wisconsin. The Journal Sentinel reported on June 15 that Foxconn, a Taiwanese company that assembles Apple’s iPhones and other electronics, is considering Wisconsin as the site for a 1,000-acre manufacturing plant, which could generate thousands of jobs. Our rating At the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s state convention, Pocan said, "Seven years later, (Scott Walker) has not hit his first campaign promise of creating 250,000 jobs." Pocan is right to say Walker hasn’t hit his first campaign promise. In 2014, we rated Walker’s campaign pledge as a Promise Broken. The number of jobs created still falls short of that promise. We rate Pocan’s statement True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Mark Pocan	None	None	None	2017-06-23T05:00:00	2017-06-02	['None']
pomt-07684	"On my first day in office, I ordered a review of every regulation in the pipeline and every contract exceeding $1 million."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/08/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-highlights-regulation-freeze-first-/	Over and over during his campaign for governor, Rick Scott said state government regulations were killing jobs and that state spending had spun out of control. Scott used part of his first State of the State speech on March 8, 2011, to highlight what he'd done to rein back government red tape. "On my first day in office, I ordered a review of every regulation in the pipeline and every contract exceeding $1 million," Scott told a joint session of the Legislature at the start of its 60-day legislative session. Is Scott right? Mostly. Within an hour of his inauguration, Scott issued Executive Order No. 11-01, which required "all agencies under the direction of the governor to immediately suspend all rulemaking." The order also imposed a 90-day suspension on contracts with a value in excess of $1 million. As part of the order, both the contracts and rules needed the approval of the governor's new Office of Fiscal Accountability and Regulatory Reform. Scott denied his first contract on Feb. 18, according to the St. Petersburg Times, rejecting an $18 million Medicaid contract between MedSolutions and the Agency for Health Care Administration for outpatient imaging services. Here's the text explaining the governor's decision to reject the contract. "Beginning Fiscal Year 2005-06 through Fiscal Year 2008-09, the following proviso was inserted and continued in the General Appropriations Act: From the funds in Specific Appropriation XXX, the agency is authorized to implement a utilization management program for outpatient diagnostic services. To date, the agency never implemented a utilization management program for outpatient diagnostic services. Proviso language is only valid for one year. The last time the above-mentioned proviso was in the General Appropriations Act was Fiscal Year 2008-09. It is uncertain if the agency would still have authority to implement such a program. The agency is unable to provide an independent study or other supporting data which would validate significant savings to the Medicaid program if such a $18,000,000.00 program were implemented." The caveat here is that while the governor instituted the freeze for the offices he controls, many state agencies were not asked to comply, including those led by members of the Florida Cabinet. On Jan. 14, the three members of the Cabinet, all Republicans -- Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam -- told the Times that they would not comply with Scott's request to have pending regulations in their offices frozen and then reviewed by the governor's office before becoming effective. "We are not sending our rules to the governor's office," Atwater spokesman Sterling Ivey said. "We are looking at all of our rules internally to make sure they align with the direction the commissioner wants to go with the department." Scott is right that he froze regulations and certain contracts upon taking office. But it didn't apply to all state agencies, and we've only found one contract that's actually been denied since the freeze took effect. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08805	The United States is "number 14, number 15" in college graduation rates, and "we're leading the world in high school dropout rates."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/17/laura-tyson/laura-tyson-correct-us-lag-college-grads-overstate/	During the Aug. 15, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Laura Tyson -- who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton -- discussed what she considers a root problem with the American economy and the current rash of high unemployment. She said, "Let me turn to investment in education. It is the case -- we used to be number one in the world in college graduation rates. We are now number 14, number 15. We're leading the world in high school dropout rates. And as I said, the unemployment problem is most severe in dropouts." (In fact, we rated a separate claim of hers from This Week that compared unemployment rates for those with and without college degrees. We gave it a Mostly True.) We wondered whether it was true that the United States ranks 14th or 15th internationally in college graduation rates and whether we're really first in high school dropout rates. To answer the question, we turned to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is a group of 32 large, industrialized democracies. It produces statistics on a wide variety of economic and social topics that are considered the best way to compare the U.S. to its international peers. On college graduation rates, we found a table that compared 22 countries in 2007 on what proportion of the population has graduated from college by the typical college graduation age in that country. On that list, the U.S. does indeed rank 14th, with 36.5 percent having a college degree. Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Sweden and the United Kingdom all ranked higher than the U.S., while Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Spain and Switzerland all ranked lower. So on this statistic, Tyson seems to be correct. Meanwhile, the OECD doesn't directly calculate high school dropout rates. We can come close by looking at a statistic that the group does track -- high school graduation rates. We looked at another table and found that the U.S. has the eighth-lowest high-school graduation rate among the countries studied. The U.S. trails Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The countries with a lower high-school graduation rate are Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey. So on this one, Tyson is off by quite a bit, though the U.S. still has higher dropout rates than the OECD average. Meanwhile, several experts warned us about a few caveats to keep in mind about these international comparisons. First, in some countries -- especially Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom -- the college graduation rates can be skewed by the presence of a lot of foreign college students. When the percentage is calculated, these students add to the numerator (that is, the number of students graduating college) but not to the denominator (the universe of possible native-born students), thus making the percentages seem higher than they would be otherwise. Second, despite the OECD's best efforts to standardize the data, there are still some variations from country to country in the nature and quality of the statistics. We noticed that while the college graduation rate for the U.S. and a number of other OECD countries rose by a few percentage points from 2000 to 2007, several countries posted increases of 10 to 15 percentage points, and Iceland nearly doubled its rate from 33 percent to 63 percent. Such massive increases probably stem from a mixture of methodological differences and a concerted effort in Europe to improve educational attainment during the past decade, said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education and a specialist in international statistical comparisons. "But overall, OECD is generally reliable for assessing the big picture, if not the fine points," he added. So let's recap. Allowing for some general caution over international education comparisons, Tyson was on the money where college graduation rates were concerned, but was wrong that the U.S. led the world in high-school dropout rates. She bats .500, so we rate her statement Half True.	None	Laura Tyson	None	None	None	2010-08-17T15:48:46	2010-08-15	['United_States']
pomt-00258	"The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world. That happened just recently."	half-true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/04/donald-trump/united-states-no-1-energy-producer-world/	Energy production -- particularly coal production -- has long been an integral part of West Virginia’s economy. During the 2016 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump vowed to send coal miners back to work and end the regulations on carbon emissions sought by President Barack Obama. Coal-producing states, particularly West Virginia, responded with strong support. So when Trump came to Wheeling, W.Va., for a rally on Sept. 29, it was no surprise that he touted the nation’s record in harnessing its energy resources. "The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world," Trump said at the rally. "That happened just recently." Is he correct? Petroleum and crude oil According to the Energy Information Administration, the federal office that collects energy statistics, 2017 data -- the most recent available -- shows that the United States ranks first in production of petroleum and other liquid fuels. The United States has a sizable lead over both Saudi Arabia and Russia. It’s been a tighter contest for a subset of petroleum production -- crude oil production -- but the United States has a case for the top spot as well. EIA projections released in September 2018 show that the United States likely edged past Saudi Arabia and Russia in crude oil production sometime this summer. Natural gas The United States also ranks first in natural gas production, according to EIA data for 2015, the most recent year available. Russia is the only close competitor in this category. Coal This is the one category where the United States is not the leader. According to 2016 data from the Energy Information Administration, the United States ranked third, behind China -- the world’s clear leader -- and India. The question of timing Beyond the question of who’s No. 1, Trump also said that this achievement "happened just recently." With the exception of the recent shift in crude oil, that’s not the case. As we noted in a 2015 fact-check, the United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since 2012, and the largest natural gas producer for years. Our ruling Trump said, "The United States is now the No. 1 energy producer in the world. That happened just recently." The United States does rank first internationally in petroleum, crude oil, and natural gas production, though it ranks third in the world in coal production. Meanwhile, only for crude oil was the No. 1 spot achieved recently. For petroleum and natural gas, the United States has ranked first for years. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-05838	Florida "unemployment has dropped more than 2 percentage points, down from 12 percent to 9.9 percent, the second-largest drop in the nation."	true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/16/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridas-unemployment-rate-had-sec/	The unemployment rate in Florida is on the mend, said Gov. Rick Scott at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 11, 2012. As evidence for his claim, he cited the state’s unemployment rate. "In my first year in office, unemployment has dropped more than 2 percentage points, down from 12 percent to 9.9 percent, the second-largest drop in the nation," Scott said. We wanted to know if Scott had his numbers right, particularly on whether Florida has seen the second-largest drop in the nation. We should note that it’s too early to say whether Scott should get credit for putting Florida’s economy on the road to recovery. In the speech, he’s clearly claiming some credit, but we’ve examined Scott’s campaign promise to create 700,000 jobs, and -- for a variety of reasons -- we’ve rated it Stalled. Here, we’re looking only at Scott’s numerical claim, that unemployment is down during his first year in office, and that it’s the second-largest drop in the country. To check his claim, we turned to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. In December 2010, the month before Scott took office, the unemployment rate was 12 percent. In December 2011, the most recent month for which statistics were available, the unemployment rate was 9.9 percent. So unemployment dropped 2.1 percent. The BLS also ranks states based on how much unemployment has fallen. Sure enough, Florida was in second place in December 2011, right behind Nevada, which dropped 2.3 percentage points, from 14.9 percent to 12.6 percent. We should note that Florida’s rate has dropped the second-most because the state’s unemployment rate has been one of the highest in the nation. And even with the 2.1 percentage point decrease, Florida still has the fifth-highest unemployment rate in the country. (Nevada is No. 1.) That mitigates the significance of Scott's claim but not the veracity of it. We rate his statement True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-02-16T11:26:38	2012-02-11	['None']
pomt-10509	The Jewish holiday Purim is "their version of Halloween here."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/20/john-mccain/costumes-yes-but-not-halloween/	Sen. John McCain's weeklong overseas trip to Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Britain and France in March 2008 was a bumpy one for accuracy. Thankfully, he had Sen. Joe Lieberman for a traveling companion. During a visit to Israel, McCain was making a somber point about the strain of Hamas rocket attacks on Israel when he dropped in a bit of a cultural gaffe, likening the Jewish holiday of Purim to Halloween. "Nine hundred rocket attacks in less than three months, an average of one every one to two hours," McCain said, during a news conference with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on March 19, 2008. "Obviously this puts an enormous and hard to understand strain on the people here, especially the children. As they celebrate their version of Halloween here, they are somewhere close to a 15-second warning, which is the amount of time they have from the time the rocket is launched to get to safety. That's not a way for people to live obviously." When Lieberman had a chance to speak at the news conference, he took the fall for McCain's mistake. "I had a brief exchange with one of the mothers whose children was in there in a costume for Purim," said Lieberman, who became the first Jewish candidate on the presidential ticket for a major American political party when he ran with Al Gore in 2000. "And it's my fault that I said to Senator McCain that this is the Israeli version of Halloween. It is in the sense because the kids dress up and it's a very happy holiday and actually it is in the sense that the sweets are very important of both holidays." Purim is a minor Jewish holiday whose roots come from a story in the Book of Esther in the Bible. According to the story, Esther was a beauty pageant winner who became queen to King Ahasuerus of Persia, but kept her Jewishness a secret. When the king's villainous minister, Haman, persuaded the king to wipe out all the Jews in the kingdom, Esther's uncle Mordecai persuaded Esther to reveal her Jewish identity to the king, and plead with him to spare her people. The king had Haman killed and elevated Mordecai to minister. "It is a story that teaches about standing up for who you are and standing up for one's community," said Rabbi Michael Torop of Temple Beth-El in St. Petersburg, and president of the Pinellas County Board of Rabbis. "It's also about standing up against hatred and injustice." During Purim, Jewish people often hold a costume parade and re-enact the story, Torop said. People sometimes dress up as kings, queens and villians from the story, but the custom has expanded into a wider variety of costumes as well (though it does not include ghouls, witches and other scary costumes commonly seen at Halloween). And friends often exchange a plate or basket of sweets, usually to include a specific pastry called hamantashen. "The only way in which Purim is like Halloween is in the wearing of costumes," said Torop. "At that point, the similarities end." Torop said he doesn't find McCain's comment offensive, but says it shows "this is one person who doesn't get it. He doesn't really understand (Purim's) meaning and its message." Which would be fine, Torop said, but when someone decides to make a public comment about someone else's faith or religion, they ought to at least understand a bit about it. Later, McCain tried to smooth things over, saying, "Could I just say that I understand this is the holiday of Hadassah, otherwise known as Esther." Lieberman's wife is named Hadassah. That's the Hebrew name of Esther, Torop said, explaining the joke McCain appeared to be making. On a Political Gaffe scale of 1 to 10, with a one being John Kerry referring to the Green Bay Packers' hallowed home as "Lambert Field" and Dan Quayle telling that poor 6th-grader to add an "e" to the end of potato being a 15, we'd rate McCain's as maybe a two. He gets a bit of a pass because he apparently got bad info from his Jewish tour guide, Lieberman. And inasmuch as both holidays involve getting dressed up, it's somewhat understandable. But still, it's False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-03-20T00:00:00	2008-03-19	['None']
pomt-02551	Says he didn't tell viewers that the Obama campaign hid news about the motives behind the attack in Benghazi because Obama was running for re-election.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/04/bill-oreilly/oreilly-denies-accusing-wh-political-motives-early/	The real fireworks of Super Bowl Sunday happened long before the snoozer of a football game between the Denver Broncos and the Seattle Seahawks. The matchup: Fox News host Bill O’Reilly versus President Barack Obama. For 10 minutes in the lead-up to the big game, O’Reilly grilled the president about the botched rollout of the government’s health care website, IRS officials who scrutinized conservative advocacy groups and the president’s reaction to the fatal attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, which left the American ambassador and three other Americans dead. On Benghazi, O’Reilly and the president had this testy exchange: O'Reilly: Your detractors believe that you did not tell the world it was a terror attack because your campaign didn't want that out. Obama: Bill, think about... O'Reilly: That's what they believe. Obama: -- and they believe it because folks like you are telling them that. O'Reilly: No, I'm not telling them that. The exchange was taken by some as Obama lashing out at Fox News and others as O’Reilly grandstanding. O'Reilly, who has been with Fox News since 1996, drew more than 4 million viewers for his Feb. 3, 2014, episode, which included more of the Obama interview. As fact-checkers, we can’t address either notion. But we wondered about O’Reilly’s claim that he did not peddle a narrative that Obama withheld information about the Benghazi attacks in order to advance his presidential campaign. A Benghazi timeline To refresh your memory, ground zero in this part of the Benghazi debate came Sept. 16, 2012, when U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said on national television that the attack on the compound began spontaneously and was not pre-planned. The reality is murkier than that statement would imply, though the exact nature of the attack remains at least somewhat unclear. O’Reilly didn’t press Obama on what happened on the ground in Benghazi. He focused on how the administration characterized the attack. Rice’s interview came less than two months before what looked to be a very tight presidential election. So let’s look at what the White House said in the days surrounding the attack. Sept. 11 - A mix of a mob and armed attackers launch grenades and set fire to the American compound. Sept. 12 -- Obama said "No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation." He repeats those words on Sept. 13 and 14. Sept. 13 -- White House spokesman Jay Carney referred to an inflammatory video and said, "The protests we're seeing around the region are in reaction to this movie. They are not directly in reaction to any policy of the United States or the government of the United States or the people of the United States." Sept. 14 -- A State Department spokeswoman said, "We are very cautious about drawing any conclusions with regard to who the perpetrators were, what their motivations were, whether it was premeditated." But she ended with this: "Obviously, there are plenty of people around the region citing this disgusting video as something that has been motivating." Sept. 16 -- Rice said, "We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned." Sept. 20 -- Carney told reporters, "It is, I think, self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result was four deaths of American officials." Sept. 20 -- Obama told an audience at a town hall meeting, "What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests." Sept. 21 -- The administration as a whole stated publicly that the attack was planned and executed by a terrorist group. Based on that record, O'Reilly isn't 100 percent correct to say Obama "did not tell the world it was a terror attack." But our question is whether O’Reilly advanced that argument and said it was for political reasons. O’Reilly on the record We searched transcripts and videos of The O’Reilly Factor and found that O’Reilly did not exactly say he personally believes that political strategists intervened to shape what Rice and others said. However, for more than a year, O’Reilly continued to raise the question when other news networks had less interest. And O’Reilly consistently cast the question of what happened during those 10 days in the worst possible light. A conversation between O’Reilly and retired Lt. Col. Ralph Peters on May 6, 2013, is a prime example. O'Reilly: You believe the Obama administration did not tell the truth to the world, not just the American people, on purpose, for political reasons. That’s what you believe? Peters: I believe that President Obama lied to the American people. O'Reilly: Himself. Peters: Himself. Sec. (Hillary) Clinton lied to Congress. Susan Rice lied to the U.N.. Jay Carney lied to the media. And the mainstream establishment media have protected this administration right down the line. O’Reilly then said, "Those are very serious charges, impeachable charges, if proven. How likely are we to get proof this week or going onward about what you believe?" Peters said the proof is already there for those who want to see it. O’Reilly didn’t challenge Peters to prove his case. He did say that concrete proof would be needed. Then he pivoted to another Fox News analyst who described an Israeli airstrike on a Syrian weapons compound. With this, O’Reilly raised the specter of American military intervention in Syria. "You know what Bill Clinton did when he got in trouble with Monica Lewinsky. He started to bomb," O’Reilly said. "To divert attention and the ‘wag the dog’ theory. But we’re not going to speculate on that. All we’re going to do is report the facts." Presumed political interference A few days later on May 10, 2013 -- eight months after the Benghazi attack -- O’Reilly interviewed ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl on Fox News and posed a question in a way that assumed a cover-up. "Here is the bottom line," O’Reilly said. "We need to find out who in the White House drove this, whether it was the president or somebody else trying to protect him in a re-election campaign. That's the main story, is it not?" In a November interview on ABC with George Stephanopoulos as part of a book tour, O’Reilly asked, "Who told her (Rice) to mislead the American public?" On other occasions, O’Reilly invoked Watergate and the impeachments of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. In 2012, during his Talking Points Memo segment, he asked if "the Libya situation is another Watergate?" While conceding that this could turn out to be a "big nothing," O’Reilly pressed the comparison. "Look at it this way," O’Reilly said. "Back in 1972, Richard Nixon denied he had anything to do with a low-level political break in. If the press had not been aggressive, Nixon would have gotten away with it. And certainly the break in at the Watergate Hotel was not nearly as important as failing to define a terrorist attack that killed four Americans." In addition, O’Reilly told his viewers that they would not get the complete story from other large news organizations. "We all know the media is sympathetic to Barack Obama," he said in his May interview with the Fox analysts. "We all know they nurture him. They root for him. And they even promote his policies. That is beyond a reasonable doubt." Appealing to Fox viewers O’Reilly’s enduring interest in Benghazi fits with the Fox News audience. A May 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that Republicans were twice as likely as Democrats to follow the latest news about Benghazi and that over half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents regularly watch Fox News. This group voiced the greatest frustration with the Benghazi situation. "Fully 79 percent of Republicans who regularly watch Fox News say the Obama administration has been dishonest," the report said. That O’Reilly might stick with the Benghazi story comes as no surprise to Mike Conway, a journalism professor at Indiana University. "The Fox audience would like the news to reflect what they believe," Conway said. "If it makes a Democrat look bad, that story will resonate stronger and if a story resonates with your core audience, that’s a reason to stay with it." Our ruling O’Reilly said he didn't tell viewers that the Obama campaign hid news about the motives behind the attack in Benghazi because he was running for re-election. While O’Reilly did not use those exact words, he consistently said that someone was trying to mislead the American public. He repeatedly compared the situation to the impeachments of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. O’Reilly nurtured suspicion. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-06007	"In campaigns in the past with Sen. McCain and President George W. Bush and others, they have tended to release tax records in April."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-presidential-candidates-tend-rele/	Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, under pressure to release his tax records, now says he'll do it in April 2012 — when taxes are due. Why wait? That's tradition, he argued at the Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Jan. 16. "You know, I looked at what has been done in campaigns in the past with Sen. McCain and President George W. Bush and others. They have tended to release tax records in April or tax season," he said. Later, he added, "And if I become our nominee, and what's happened in history is people have released them in about April of the coming year, and that's probably what I would do." PolitiFact has already checked whether presidential candidates usually release their tax returns, a claim we found Mostly True. (There are several notable exceptions, such as publisher Steve Forbes in 1996.) But the question of timing intrigued us: Is April truly the month of choice? McCain, Bush and others We reviewed news accounts going back six presidential elections for clues. We've got to mention that there's nothing new about the battle for tax records. Candidates aren't required to disclose them and sometimes don't. Competitors and the press browbeat Jesse Jackson for weeks before he released returns in 1988. Forbes' refusal to release tax records became a hot campaign issue in 1996, since he focused on a proposal for a flat tax. And no sooner had John Kerry released his own tax records in 2004 than the drumbeat began for his wife's financial history. But back to Romney's appeal to an April tradition. Here's what we found: • April is a typical month to release tax records for the most recent year. It only makes sense — a candidate would file his or her tax return, then release it to the public. There were exceptions, of course, with candidates dragging their feet for weeks or refusing to release records at all. • Romney focused on two candidates who released tax records after they had wrapped up the GOP nomination, but plenty of primary contenders joined the disclosure-fest earlier in the process. (In 2008, several Republicans declined, but in 2004, all the major Democratic contenders released at least a year's returns, according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.) • On Bush and McCain, Romney was generally right. In 2000, Bush released estimates of his earnings and taxes in April but got a six-month extension to release the actual forms in October. In 2004, as president, Bush released records in April. In 2008, Republican nominee McCain released tax records in April. (Democratic primary candidate Hillary Clinton also released her tax return in April; Obama released a batch in March, then his most recent return in April.) • But the April trend was less clear when it came to previous years' tax records. In 1996, Republican candidate Bob Dole released 30 years of tax returns in January, weeks before he became the presumptive nominee. In 1987, Democrat Michael Dukakis released five years of federal tax returns in November — in advance of the election year and well before the primaries. Dole one-upped him in January 1988 with 21 years of tax returns. Who kicked off all this voluntary transparency? Romney's father, George, who as a presidential candidate in 1967 released 12 years of income tax returns — in November before election year. For a quick glimpse at when candidates released returns for the last six presidential races, here's a nonexhaustive list. (It doesn't include every primary candidate, such as the batch of Democrats in 2004 — many of whom were already in the habit of annually releasing returns — nor all sitting presidents, who typically release returns when they file. Both of those categories, because they mostly reflect current returns released around the same time they are filed, would further bulk up the April list.) Months for tax return releases November before election year: Bill Bradley, 1999 Michael Dukakis, 1987 (5 years' worth) January: Bob Dole, 1996 (30 years' worth) Phil Gramm, 1996 Bob Dole, 1988 (21 years' worth) March: Barack Obama, 2008 (6 years' worth) April: Barack Obama, 2008 (his just filed return) Hillary Clinton, 2008 John McCain, 2008 John Kerry, 2004 George W. Bush, 2000 Al Gore, 2000 Bob Dole, 1996 Bill Clinton, 1992 (12 years' worth) May: Michael Dukakis, 1988 Jesse Jackson, 1988 Our ruling Romney's right that there's a strong April trend for releasing tax records, especially among politicians who practice annual disclosure. But that's not Romney's history — he's steadfastly refused to open his personal tax records for public consumption. That weakens his appeal to tradition. He could just as easily follow in the footsteps of Obama, Bill Clinton, Dukakis, Dole and his own father and release a batch of earlier federal tax returns now. Meanwhile, he implies that only party nominees release their tax records — when recent history shows primary candidates opening their files to inspection. His statement that candidates "have tended to release tax records in April" is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-01974	"There are 278 Republicans in Congress. (With Eric Cantor's defeat), they are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/18/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-without-eric-cantor-republicans-co/	Dave Brat’s surprise primary win over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor didn’t just knock out a potential successor to Speaker John Boehner. Because Cantor was Jewish, the lone voice for religious diversity in the GOP’s congressional ranks will also disappear, argued Bill Maher, host of HBO’s Real Time. "Now there are no non-Christian Republicans. This is an amazing fact," Maher said June 13. "There are 278 Republicans in Congress. They are now all Christian and all white except for one black senator who was appointed. So this is an entirely Christian, white party." Does Cantor’s primary defeat mean Republicans in Congress are now all white and all Christian? Republicans ‘all Christian’ The 2012 elections ushered in the first Buddhist in the Senate (Hawaii’s Mazie Hirono, a Democrat), the first Hindu in either chamber (Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat), and the first Congress member to list her religious affiliation as "none" (Arizona Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat), according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, which recorded the religious affiliation of members for a 2012 report. They joined two Muslims (Democrats) and a Unitarian Universalist (a Democrat). When it comes to Republicans, 192 of 278 GOP members identify with a Protestant denomination (Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, etc.), 70 identify as Catholic, three are Orthodox Christian, and 12 are Mormon (more on that in a moment). Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, is Jewish and makes No. 278, but Brat, the Republican who could succeed him after the November election, is Catholic. The only possible hang-up to Maher’s claim when examining the current makeup of Congress when it comes to religion is how you view Mormonism. Some Christians do not recognize Mormons, belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as Christians. Mormons do consider themselves Christians. Republicans ‘all white’ Maher also said the GOP’s congressional ranks are all-white except for one appointed African-American official. That’s Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who resigned his House seat for a Senate appointment in January 2013. To say the other Republicans in Congress are all white depends on your definition of "all white," which isn’t always so easy to define. There are no other African-American Republicans in Congress (there are 43 black Democrats). There also are no Asian or Pacific Islander Republicans in Congress (there are 13 Democrats). But there are three Hispanic Republican senators and seven Hispanic Republicans in the House, according to the Congressional Research Service. That includes Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Florida Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Mario Diaz-Balart, and Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, born in Puerto Rico. The Census Bureau, however, does not include Hispanic or Latino as a racial designation, instead using the categories white, black, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian. The Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnicity, which is based on cultural or linguistic similarity. Hispanics could identify with any race depending on the region from where they descend, or list none at all. Pew says as many as 6.2 percent of census respondents selected "some other race" in the 2010 census, the vast majority of whom were Hispanic. And there is a movement to include Hispanic as a racial category in future censuses, says Kevin Dougherty, Baylor University sociology professor. "To say they are all white, you think they have very fair skin and have European descent," Dougherty said. "It does mask an important source of diversity that is present among Republicans in Congress." It’s not just Hispanics who are unaccounted for in Maher’s claim. We know of two Republicans that are enrolled members of federally recognized American Indian tribes. The first is Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation tribe. The second is freshman Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a citizen of the Cherokee Nation. The timeline of all this One more critical point: When Maher says the Republicans in Congress are "now" all white and all Christian, that’s not accurate -- Cantor isn’t going anywhere yet. The GOP’s lone Jewish member will not leave until his replacement is sworn into office in early 2015, after the midterm elections. And as he leaves office, it’s possible that new non-white, non-Christian Republicans could take seats in Congress. There are several possibilities: Mia Love, a Republican African-American running for Congress in Utah, is a far-and-away favorite to win a seat in the U.S. House come November. Will Hurd, an African-American Republican, secured the GOP nomination in Texas’ most-competitive House district (which backed Mitt Romney for president in 2012). T.W. Shannon, an African-American Republican, has the support of Texas’ Cruz in Shannon’s bid for an Oklahoma Senate seat. (His primary is June 24.) A Jewish Republican and state lawmaker, Adam Kwasman, is running in the Republican primary in Arizona’s 1st Congressional District. Our ruling Without Cantor, Maher said, the GOP in Congress is "now all Christian and all white except for one black senator, who was appointed." Maher’s show did not respond to a request for comment. If we learned anything from this fact-check, it is that straightforward sounding claims about religion and race are rarely that straightforward. Still, Maher’s unequivocal statement glosses over some diversity within the GOP’s ranks. On religion, Maher's claim comes down to how you view Mormonism. On race, the question is even more murky. There are two members of federally recognized American Indian tribes, which is classified as a race by the U.S. Census Bureau, and there are as many 10 Republicans in the House and Senate with Hispanic roots. Some may consider their race white, Hispanic or something else. Also, Cantor isn’t leaving office until the end of his term in January. It’s possible the November elections will bring non-Christian or non-white Republican members who will take office when Cantor leaves. Maher’s statement is partially accurare but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08624	"Ganley said that if elected, he wants to ‘cut the dickens’ out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans’ benefits."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/20/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-campaign-claims-tom-ganley-wants-cut-/	Tom Ganley is the first serious challenger that Copley Township Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton has faced since she was first elected to Congress in 2006. The wealthy auto dealer from Brecksville won the GOP nod to run against her and funneled more than $2 million of his personal fortune into his campaign. In an effort to fill her own campaign coffers, Sutton has sent fundraising missives to supporters. A fundraising email in early September from her campaign began: "Dishonest used car dealer Tom Ganley is at it again, and this time he’s going after seniors and veterans. Recently, Ganley said that if elected, he wants to ‘cut the dickens’ out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans’ benefits." Does Ganley want to play Scrooge with popular entitlement programs? AFL-CIO President Richard L. Trumka repeated the claim at the Lorain Labor Day Festival, where he and Sutton appeared together. "And how about Republican candidate Tom Ganley of Akron, who wants Betty Sutton’s job?" Trumka asked the crowd. "He’s the guy with the Mercedes dealership who promises to – and I quote – ‘cut the Dickens’ out of Medicare, Social Security and Veterans’ benefits for average working people." PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look, and contacted Ganley campaign spokesperson, Meghan Snyder, who says it ain’t so. Ganley believes programs like Social Security should be protected and Democrats are twisting his words from an Aug. 29 interview with the conservative news site "Human Events," she says. In that interview, Ganley said he wants to freeze all federal spending for at least a year "and then surgically attack it. National defense should be left alone, but everything else should be on the table and studied carefully. So much of the budget is now mandated, that we have to re-open entitlements. All domestic discretionary spending should have the dickens cut out of it." According to the federal budgeting experts at Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Medicare, Social Security and Veterans’ benefits are not considered discretionary spending under the federal budget. They are entitlement programs. Unlike discretionary programs, entitlements are not controlled by yearly appropriations from Congress. About a third of the federal budget is considered discretionary, including areas like education, health research and housing. Discretionary areas like those are where Ganley said "the dickens" should be cut. We talked to AFL-CIO spokesman Josh Goldstein, who defended Trumka’s assertion. Ganley’s words to Human Events clearly state "he wants to cut everything but defense and then tags the dickens line to ‘discretionary,’ " Goldstein said. He noted that the distorted version of Ganley’s quote was also picked up by the liberal "Buckeyestateblog," and was cited in a Lorain Morning Journal "Letter to the Editor." "I do think the quote there clearly states his intentions," Goldstein said in an email. "You are right to point out the unintended mistake in directly quoting, but there’s no question that the point is completely accurate." Sutton campaign manager Julie Sweet sent an email that gave her rationale for claiming Ganley wants to cut "the dickens" out of particular entitlement programs, when he actually said "the dickens" should be cut from discretionary programs. 　 "Tom Ganley’s statement to Human Events couldn’t be any clearer: Entitlements – which his spokesperson says include Social Security, Medicare, and programs designed to benefit older Americans – should be re-opened and therefore not protected as mandatory spending. And if he doesn’t want them to be mandatory spending, he wants them to be discretionary, and he wants to cut the dickens out of discretionary spending." We think Ganley’s statement is clear, and it doesn’t say what the campaign claims it says. Sutton could justifiably question the meaning of his assertion that entitlements should be reopened. But she’s also a veteran member of Congress who knows that’s not done easily. And the claim that Ganley wants to "cut the dickens" out of Medicare, Social Security and Veterans programs is a leap. Ganley never told Human Events he wants to cut "the dickens" out of Social Security, Medicare and Veterans’ benefits. That’s why we rate this as a Pants on Fire claim. Comment on this item.

pomt-11631	"Chicago now has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jan/22/rahm-emanuel/chicagos-private-sector-employment-really-highest-/	In a recent WGN radio interview, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel boasted that the count of private sector jobs in the city had hit an all-time high even as employment statewide sagged. "Chicago now has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city," Emanuel told host Steve Cochran. "And we’re doing it even with a state that’s actually dragging us back." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To put a fine point on it, Emanuel repeated the claim a minute later. "I just told you, Chicago now has the highest private sector employment — ever," the mayor said, stressing the word "ever." All of which raises a demographic and workplace quandary. Census data make clear that the Chicago of today is a much smaller place than the Chicago of yesteryear. State officials counted nearly 1.18 million private sector jobs in Chicago, a number Emanuel’s office says is a record. How then to reconcile that claim with a city population swoon dating back to the 1950s? We decided to check. The exceptions that prove the rule Chicago was long known as the "second city," and while there is debate about the derivation of that nickname it is clear that for much of the last century the city trailed only New York in size. Census data show the city’s population peaked at 3.6 million in the official 1950 count. It was a very different era. South Side steel mills were thriving and the stockyards of "hog butcher to the world" fame were humming. The postwar suburban boom was only in its infancy, and the expressway system that eventually would make reverse commutes feasible had yet to be laid out. Just shy of 1.5 million Chicago residents held private sector jobs, according to the 1950 census, more than one-third of which were in manufacturing industries. Back then, Chicago’s workforce was still very much a collection of lunch-pail toting, blue-collar strap hangars, the decline of which is much lamented by politicians of today. The city’s population dwindled over the intervening decades, as did the number of jobs held by its residents. Today, the census pegs the city’s population at 2.7 million, down 900,000 from its 1950 high. But as late as 1970, census data show the population stood at nearly 3.4 million, with 1.2 million employed in the private sector. Yet Emanuel says private sector employment in the city is the highest ever. For an explanation, we reached out to the mayor’s office, where Emanuel spokesman Grant Klinzman pointed us to a December report from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. Klinzman said the nearly 1.18 million private sector jobs for Chicago were the highest in the history of the state report, which is issued annually. That explanation is problematic. In his radio remarks, Emanuel was emphatic that the 2017 jobs numbers were "the highest in the history of the city," not just in the history of the report. What’s more, the Chicago numbers aren’t the highest in the history of the report, not by a longshot. Indeed, IDES spokesman Bob Gough said the state report series goes back to the 1950s, though only the last few decades worth of reports are posted online. Gough provided a copy of an old report that detailed city jobs numbers dating back to 1957. That year, it showed, Chicago logged 1.38 million private sector jobs—200,000 more than the current figure Emanuel says is a record. In 1990, the IDES private sector job tally for Chicago stood at 1.2 million, still in excess of the 2017 total. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Gough said the methodology of data collection had changed over the years, but the bottom line employment numbers were unaffected. While Emanuel’s claim is contradicted by both state employment and federal census data, it’s important to note that the two agencies measure different things so their results don’t perfectly align. The census counts jobs held by Chicago residents, while the IDES counts jobs physically located in the city even if they are held by suburbanites and other non-residents. When we ran the old census data by Klinzman, he dismissed the line of questioning as irrelevant. "At this point, we are parsing footnotes on a census report that predates the Eisenhower Administration," he wrote in an email. Experts we spoke with didn’t see it that way. "Just the raw population of the city of Chicago in 1950 was 3.6 million people," said Peter Creticos, director of the Chicago-based Institute for Work and the Economy. "We're at 2.7 (million). Just sort of on the face of it, you start to wonder." Our ruling Emanuel said,"Chicago now has the highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city." That claim is refuted by a broad array of both state and federal jobs data which show Chicago was once a much bigger city with many more residents employed and many more jobs within the city limits than it has today. There is no doubt that the city jobs picture is brighter now than it has been in quite some time. But Emanuel took inarguably good news and sought to make it stupendous with his unsupportable contention that Chicago’s count of private sector jobs is now greater than at any time in the city’s history. We rate his statement False.	None	Rahm Emanuel	None	None	None	2018-01-22T07:00:00	2018-01-09	['None']
pomt-07996	"Every dropout costs us $72,000 for the life of that person."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jan/16/robert-flanders/education-chairman-says-each-high-school-dropout-c/	With Rhode Island facing a budget crisis, officials are desperate to find ways to generate more revenue or save money. During a Dec. 17, 2010, budget summit, Robert G. Flanders Jr., chairman of the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education, said bringing down the state's high school dropout rate could be the key because a well-educated work force would attract new business. In addition, he said, there could be a direct monetary benefit to government as well. "The biggest thing I think we can do at the state level to promote savings is to do a better job of keeping kids in school and not having them turn out to be dropouts because the dropout problem -- it's not unique to Rhode Island of course -- but every dropout costs us $72,000 for the life of that person, whereas any person who has a college degree is generating hundreds of thousands of dollars for the state," he said. "The most expensive tuition we pay is the tuition to send kids to the training school or the ACI [Adult Correction Institutions], and those are disproportionately populated with people who have no education or who have dropped out and have no skills to get jobs." Does each dropout really cost the state $72,000 over a lifetime? We're always curious where the numbers like these come from, so we decided to go to the source. Flanders' office directed us to an April 2009 report from Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies prepared for the Board of Governors for Higher Education, The Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Rhode Island. To find out how much high school dropouts cost the state, the authors used data gathered for the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to make several estimates. One was their average earnings from age 18 to 64 in 2007 dollars. That number turns out to be $827,438. Then they estimated how much a typical dropout pays during that period in federal, state and local taxes, including property and sales taxes. Finally, they subtracted how much the typical dropout is expected to receive in unemployment compensation, disability, food stamps, Medicaid, workers' compensation and other social welfare programs, or how much would be spent to keep them in prison, using national incarceration statistics. It turns out that, by their reckoning, an average high school dropout costs society $440,214 from age 18 to 64. That's offset by the $367,867 he or she pays in taxes. Thus, a dropout's lifetime cost is $72,347, which is where Flanders' $72,000 number comes from. Looked at another way, the money you save by converting one dropout to one high school graduate is even higher. According to the methods used in the study, graduates have a lifetime income of $1,206,250, pay $532,922 in taxes, and consume $216,217 in services. Instead of being a $72,347 drain to the government, they add $316,705 to state, local, city and town coffers. So the average net benefit to the tax rolls of preventing one dropout is $389,052 over a lifetime. In theory. One problem with Flanders' comment is that he was talking about the impact of dropouts on the state, while the study looked at all taxes -- state, federal and local. State taxes make up about one quarter of a person's tax burden, according to estimates from The Tax Foundation, a respected business-backed tax policy group. Suddenly the $389,052 in tax benefit accrued by preventing one dropout and helping them graduate drops to about $100,000 over a lifetime. That's $2,100 per year. Meanwhile, we found other sources of information that made us wonder about the estimates. If you do the math, you discover that, according to the study, dropouts and high school graduates pay 44 percent of their lifetime earnings in taxes. But The Tax Foundation, which gives an annual estimate of how much Americans pay in taxes, reports that state, federal and local taxes amount to 27 percent of income, a much smaller ratio. Also, in 2005, Cecilia Rouse, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, made her own estimate of the lifetime difference in income between dropouts and high school graduates. She pegged it at $260,000, much smaller than estimate of $378,812 found in the study cited by Flanders. In her study, Rouse noted that the dollar amount varies significantly depending on how the economy behaves. The lifetime estimate could be as low as $121,000 or as high as $294,000. Rouse, who now works at the White House as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, said such estimates include all sorts of assumptions that can quickly turn out to be outdated. "There's a lot of variation in this," she said. "These numbers are, at best, illustrative and are meant to make a point, and I don't encourage anybody to . . . say, 'That's the number.'" Christy Huebner Caridi, director of the Marist College Bureau of Economic Research in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., expressed concern that the Harrington study "didn't pick up indirect costs such as the need for increased police and private security because there's an increased criminal element" with more dropouts. "There are many factors they couldn't take into consideration in a study like this," she said. We asked Paul Harrington, the chief author of the study cited by Flanders, who is now at Drexel University in Philadelphia, about some of the discrepancies. He said one reason for the variation is that other reports exclude people who have no earnings; even though they have no income, they do end up paying some types of taxes such as sales tax. "Because there are many more zero earners among dropouts, this will bring down their average per capita lifetime earnings estimates proportionately more than it will lower their average lifetime tax burden, given that they do pay some taxes," he warned. "Our findings are consistent with other reports once we exclude zero earners from the analysis." He also noted, correctly, that the Rouse study looked at employee payroll taxes, state income and federal income taxes, not sales and other types of taxes. So that's another reason why the analysis would come up with different numbers. "I think we're using some of the best data out there for research purposes," he said. "I think these are probably pretty solid numbers." There's no disagreement that dropping out of high school is harmful, both for the individual and society. Dropouts tend to make less money, get in trouble with the law more often, require more social services and end up with more health problems. But the $72,000 figure strikes us as another example of experts making assumptions and doing calculations that produce numbers that sound precise, yet may only be rough approximations of the truth. In the end, while experts may calculate the cost of dropouts in different ways, they all agree that turning would-be dropouts into high school graduates is beneficial to the economy. But Flanders cited the $72,000 figure with a degree of certainty that is undeserved. And he did not make it clear that the figure includes lost tax revenue to the federal government, not just the state. As a result, the Truth-O-Meter grades his assertion as Half True.

pomt-02767	"The middle class can be defined to include those with income between roughly $20,000 and $60,000."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/11/oregon-business-association/does-middle-class-include-those-income-between-200/	Every election season, politicians seek to renew their love affair with the American middle class. Proposals, stretching from "middle-class tax breaks" to tuition tax credits for "middle class" parents of college students, fill the airwaves. Trouble is, there’s no definition of this group that everyone can agree upon. The meaning of the term, depending on who is using it and for what purpose, can be stretched like a rubber band. "There’s not really a definition of what constitutes middle class," Aparna Mathur, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., wrote in an email. "It’s more of a notional concept of how you view yourself relative to others." Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, for instance, last year set the upper-end figure for middle class membership at a household income of $250,000 a year. President Barack Obama set the bar a little lower, at $200,000. Actual income levels around the country make both of those figures high. The Oregon Business Association made "rebuilding the middle class" the top priority in its recently unveiled 2014 work plan. That goal is critical, according to the Portland-based association, because middle-class jobs took the biggest hit during the Great Recession and have been slowest to grow in the recent expansion. When it came to defining terms, the association said this: "The middle class can be defined to include those with income between roughly $20,000 and $60,000." The $60,000 figure sounded about right, despite Romney’s and Obama’s definitions, but $20,000 struck us as low. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We called D.J. Vogt, the business association’s legislative director. He said the figures came from a chart in a recent state Office of Economic Analysis report showing the bulk of "middle income" wages for various occupations in Oregon falling between $20,000 and $60,000. "I was including anything that could be considered middle class," Vogt said. "I took the broadest possible income level to put a number on it." We then called Mark McMullen, Oregon state economist, who co-authored the report that Vogt relied on. He noted that nowhere did the term "middle class" appear. "We stick to calling them middle-wage jobs," McMullen said. "We don’t want to make any inference about spending power or quality of life given those income levels." In addition, he said, the term is simply too loaded politically to serve a useful research purpose. But what about saying that the "middle" of Oregon’s income scale is bookended by $20,000 and $60,000? A review of 2011 Oregon tax returns, the most recent year for which information is available, puts the business association on firmer ground, McMullen said. Oregon Revenue Department figures for 2011 show the high end of each quintile -- the standard slicing of income ranges into fifths, with each quintile having roughly the same number of tax filers -- looks like this: Bottom 20 percent: up to $9,881 Second-lowest 20 percent: up to $22,833 Middle 20 percent: up to $41,631 Second-highest 20 percent: up to $75,152 Top 20 percent, split into three groups: the first 15 percent, up to $145,039; the next 4 percent, up to $302,811; and the top 1 percent, more than $302,811. So while the association’s high-end "middle class" figure looked pretty solid, its low-end $20,000 looked dubious. Someone earning that much a year is actually near the bottom of the state’s income scale. For reference, we also checked federal statistics, which place the poverty threshold at $11,490 for a single-earner and $23,500 for a family of four. So someone earning $20,000 might be in poverty if they’re supporting others, or not far off. Not a great place, in other words, to be calling the middle-class home. Mary C. King, a Portland State University economics professor, disputed the idea that $20,000 a year, even for a single-earner, can be called middle class. However, she acknowledged the same stumbling block others identify, that "middle class" can be as much of an idea as a definable economic reality. "Still," she said, "that just makes no sense at all. That’s $10 an hour. No one is getting a mortgage on $20,000 a year." The median income for all U.S. households last year was just over $51,000, she noted, and the average was about $71,000. PolitiFact has waded into this territory before and agrees there is no official definition of "middle class." Is it having a home mortgage? Being able to afford two cars or send kids to college? We’re still not certain -- and neither are most economists, as indicated by Mathur’s email reply -- but we do think the term has its economic limits. And those limits don’t extend anywhere near the official poverty range, as the business association’s $20,000 does.

pomt-09782	"FDR was called a socialist and a communist."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/22/barack-obama/obama-roosevelt-socialist-communist/	Sound familiar? The president was accused of being "a socialist, not a Democrat." His plan was described as "undisguised state socialism." One critic, who controlled some powerful media outlets, suggested that communists had infiltrated the president's administration. Those are some of the attacks that Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced in the 1930s — attacks cited recently by President Barack Obama to emphasize that he's not unique. Obama has mentioned the Roosevelt comparison several times recently, including during an interview on Late Night with David Letterman on Sept. 21, 2009: "What's happened is that whenever a president tries to bring about significant changes, particularly during times of economic unease, then there is a certain segment of the population that gets very riled up," Obama said. "FDR was called a socialist and a communist." Indeed, Roosevelt was called a socialist or a communist many times. Most of that criticism came in the 1930s, when he was enacting programs intended to pull the country out of the Great Depression. • "Roosevelt is a socialist, not a Democrat," declared Republican Rep. Robert Rich of Pennsylvania during a debate on the House floor on July 23, 1935. That remark came after Republicans hinted they were considering a move to impeach Roosevelt, according to the New York Times . • "The New Deal is now undisguised state socialism, declared Senator Simeon D. Fess (R-Ohio) today as he pictured President Roosevelt as the New Deal's leading socialist," reported the Chicago Daily Tribune on Aug. 7, 1934. "The president's recent statements," Fess said, "remove any doubt of his policy of state socialism, which necessitates increased activities of the government in either ownership or operation of industry, or both." • "The Russian newspapers during the last election [1932] published the photograph of Franklin D. Roosevelt over the caption, 'The first communistic President of the United States,'" said Sen. Thomas Schall, a Republican from Minnesota. "Evidently the Russian newspapers had knowledge concerning the ultimate intent of the President, which had been carefully withheld from the voters in this country. In fact, the voters of the United States were meticulously misled as to such intentions." We found Schall's comments in the book, All But the People: Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Critics, 1933-1939 . And then there's FDR being called a socialist by William Randolph Hearst. Hearst, a newspaper mogul, initially supported Roosevelt. But he gradually became disillusioned with the new president's policies. He especially hated Roosevelt's plan to increase taxes on the wealthy, and his papers routinely referred to the New Deal as the Raw Deal. By 1936, when Roosevelt was running for re-election, Hearst decided to support Republican Alf Landon and oppose Roosevelt with all the power of the press he could muster. Historian Ben Procter summarized this moment in history in his book William Randolph Hearst: The Later Years, 1911-1951 : "On September 6, Hearst newspapers began a prolonged assault on the administration. The New York American published a front-page editorial titled, 'The Radical Brand on the New Deal.' It charged that radical and communist leaders had already given their approval to support Roosevelt against Landon. During the next two weeks Hearst editors trumpeted these recurring themes: that communists had infiltrated the New Deal; that communism was un-American and undemocratic; that 'America can only judge Mr. Roosevelt and his administration by the strange silence that has prevailed in official quarters.'" That was as much as Roosevelt was willing to take. The White House issued a statement that mentioned "a certain notorious newspaper owner," and rebutted the accusations. The statement concluded, "The American people will not permit their attention to be diverted from real issues to fake issues which no patriotic, honorable, decent citizen would purposefully inject into American affairs." Hearst shot back in a front-page editorial, which he signed personally. "Let me say that I have not stated at any time whether the President willingly or unwillingly received the support of the Karl Marx Socialists, the Frankfurter radicals, communists and anarchists, the Tugwell bolsheviks, and the Richberg revolutionists which constitute the bulk of his following," Hearst wrote. "I have simply said and shown that he does receive the support of these enemies of the American system of government, and that he has done his best to deserve the support of all such disturbing and destructive elements." Hearst's efforts were for naught. Roosevelt won the 1936 election in a landslide, while the Hearst newspaper chain slid into bankruptcy. There's not much controversy on this one, but it did provide an interesting opportunity to review American history. We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-01414	Milwaukee police and firefighters "are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting zero or one percent raises."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/09/nik-kovac/alderman-nik-kovac-says-police-fire-workers-routin/	Some city employees would get a New Year’s gift under a proposal by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett to soften Act 10’s effect on their pocketbooks. After losing a legal fight, the city is complying with Gov. Scott Walker’s 2011 collective-bargaining law and will begin deducting pension contributions from those workers not already making them. To help offset the pension contributions, Barrett wants to give 3.9 percent raises for general city employees. The plan, which carries a price tag of $4.8 million, would not apply to police and firefighters. They were exempted from the provisions of Act 10. City officials say most fire and police personnel pay little or nothing toward their pensions and -- unlike most other city employees -- still can negotiate over benefits and pay. East Side Alderman Nik Kovac said Barrett’s plan for raises seems reasonable. And in a Sept. 30, 2014 Fox6 TV interview, Kovac addressed the disparities between different groups of city employees under Act 10. Police and fire officials "are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting a zero or 1 percent raise," Kovac said. "That imbalance, the longer it continues, is going to hurt morale and make it harder and harder to run the city in a fair manner." Four percent vs. nothing? Routinely? That got our attention. On Facebook, a few firefighters pushed back on Kovac’s claim, saying they have not seen a raise in two or three years. "Nic, where are you getting 4% annually?" a Fire Department employee commented. "This is not just misleading, it’s wrong." What are the real numbers? When we asked Kovac for backup, he said he spoke off the cuff with the TV reporter. In doing so, he misspoke. After checking the recent history of raises with the city budget office, Kovac said he should not have said "routine" or "annual" in regards to 4 percent raises for police and fire. Maria Monteagudo, the city’s employee relations director, sent us the base pay increases for city employees back to 1991. Here are the percentage raises from 2010 to present. (Fire and police unions ratified contracts for 2010-2012 after Act 10 took effect in 2011). Fire Police General Managers 2010 0% 0% 0% 0% 2011 0.5%-0.8% 0% 0% 0% 2012 4.3% 3.55%* 0% 0% 2013 n/a** n/a** 1.5% 1.5% 2014 n/a** n/a** 1.0% 1.0% *Patrol officers received another $575 per year **Contract negotiations ongoing In 2012, firefighters and police received raises in the 4 percent range while general employees received nothing. But that was a one-year blip. With that exception, across-the-board raises have been small or nonexistent for all city employees dating to 2010, the year before Act 10. One important note: For 2013 and 2014, public safety employees have not yet negotiated a contract with the city. So while they have received nothing so far, they could still receive raises retroactively once a contract agreement is reached. General city workers and managers received small raises for those two years. That was done without collective bargaining for most of those workers, because the largest labor union representing city employees was not recertified under Act 10 rules, Monteagudo said. Before 2010, city employees of all types typically got 2 percent to 3 percent raises with small variations. Unionized workers typically were around the top of that range, with non-represented managers closer to the low end. Within the union ranks since 2007, police and fire raises have outstripped those for general workers. Mandatory furloughs, including of police and fire workers, have cut further into pay. Barrett’s 2015 budget would eliminate furloughs for non-uniformed workers, while their future use for police and fire workers would depend on the outcome of labor negotiations. Our rating Kovac said police and fire workers "are routinely getting 4 percent raises annually while everybody else is either getting zero or one percent raises." That scenario was seen in 2012, but so far has not reappeared. Uniformed workers have had a leg up on general employees since Act 10, but only marginally in a time of austerity. We rate the claim False.	None	Nik Kovac	None	None	None	2014-10-09T12:00:00	2014-09-30	['None']
pomt-13365	Says "Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party want to get rid of the public school system."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/29/chelsea-clinton/partial-credit-chelsea-clinton-gets-says-gary-john/	Cosmopolitan magazine interviewed Chelsea Clinton the morning after the first presidential debate and asked the former First Daughter about the move of millennials from Democrat Bernie Sanders to Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein. "I would just urge young voters to actually look at what the different candidates are offering," Clinton said. "Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party want to get rid of the public school system in our country. If that’s what you believe, then you should actually support him. I think the public school system in our country has been one of the greatest, if not the greatest, investment of our values of the belief that everyone and anyone should have the chance to, as my mom says, 'live up to their God-given potential.' " "We have a lot of work to do to ensure that that is true in every school district and every school in our country," she added. "But I don’t think the work that we have to do entails getting rid of the public school system." A reader asked if Clinton was correct and if abolition of public education is really part of the platform of Johnson and his party. Because a party platform doesn't necessarily reflect the views of a presidential candidate, we'll consider them separately. The party The Libertarian Party believes that government should play a minimal role in human affairs and that this minimalist approach fosters liberty, enterprise and personal responsibility. The party's website says, "Government's only role is to help individuals defend themselves from force and fraud." That would leave out education. Its latest platform, adopted at its May 2016 convention in Orlando, Fla., doesn't directly call for getting rid of the public school system. But it does say, "Education is best provided by the free market, achieving greater quality, accountability and efficiency with more diversity of choice. Recognizing that the education of children is a parental responsibility, we would restore authority to parents to determine the education of their children, without interference from government. Parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children’s education." In short, public education is not one of the roles government should play. Johnson's stance As for Johnson's philosophy, both the Clinton campaign and the Johnson campaign referred us to a Sept. 14, 2016, entry in Politico's education blog. It states that Johnson wants to eliminate the U.S. Education Department, a proposal that has been popular with Republican candidates in recent years. When Politico asked Johnson what the federal role should be in public education, he responded, "I don't see one." It's important to note here that the federal government doesn't run America's public school systems. That's done by state and local governments. The Politico piece notes that Johnson has been an advocate for universal vouchers as a way to improve educational performance through competition. The candidate told the website, "I do think ultimately it would be the end of traditional public schools, and that would be for the better. Public schools are not going to go away, but they are going to embrace the innovation that would occur if students had a choice." To say that "public schools are not going to go away" at the same time you say this "would be the end of traditional public schools" seems to amount to doublespeak, so we asked the Johnson campaign for some clarification how this would be handled on a state and local level, where the real education work is done. We didn't hear back. On his website, Johnson says that "state and local governments should have more control over education policy" and calls for the elimination of "attempts to impose national standards and requirements on local schools (that) are costly, overly bureaucratic, and actually compromise our ability to provide our children with a good education." Meanwhile, we found a May 30, 2016, Forbes article reporting how Johnson initially raised education spending when he was governor of New Mexico but then decided to push a voucher system. The plan was to let each student have a voucher valued at about $4,000 at a time when the public school system cost was roughly $6,000 per pupil. If a student spent that voucher on a private school, that would mean more money left behind to educate a public school child, Johnson argued. Parents would pull their children out of the bad schools — public or private — and they would have to close. Our ruling Clinton said, "Gary Johnson and the Libertarian Party want to get rid of the public school system." The Libertarian platform calls for a free market educational system that puts the responsibility on the parents. Johnson clearly wants to get the federal government out of the education business, but public schools are run by the states and local communities, and there Johnson is giving mixed signals about the degree to which he wants to fully privatize public education. Because Clinton's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/290b228f-0400-4d2e-be9d-9bb130fe5510	None	Chelsea Clinton	None	None	None	2016-09-29T17:29:32	2016-09-28	['None']
pomt-01099	"After World War II, we tried, convicted, and, in some cases, executed Japanese soldiers for war crimes that included charges of waterboarding."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/jan/12/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-after-wwii-us-executed-japanese-war-cr/	Rep. Bobby Scott was appalled by the findings of a Senate report detailing the enhanced interrogation methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Senate report detailed many instances when the U.S. waterboarded suspected terrorists, a drowning-like procedure in which interrogators covered detainees’ faces with a cloth and doused them with water, sometimes until they fell unconscious. Scott, D-3rd, denounced the waterboarding as a torture method inconsistent with the United States’ image as a "moral authority" and said the report shows the country "failed to lead by example." "After World War II, we tried, convicted, and in some cases, executed Japanese soldiers for war crimes that included charges of waterboarding," Scott said in a Dec. 9 news release. We wondered if Scott’s war history is correct. His spokesman, Dave Dailey, supported Scott’s statement by pointing to previous fact checks of similar claims, including one by PolitiFact National of a statement that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,made in 2007 and another claim that former Vice President Dick Cheney made last year. The claims harken back to the mid to late 1940s when officials of the Axis powers were tried and convicted, and some executed, for a wide range of war crimes. The term "waterboarding" didn’t exist then, but the allegations levelled by prosecutors and U.S. POWs against Japanese military officials referred to techniques called "water torture," "water treatments" and "water cure." The procedures were described in a 2007 essay by Evan Wallach, an attorney who specialized in the laws of war and later was appointed by President Barack Obama as a federal appeals court judge. Wallach wrote his essay in response to a 2002 Justice Department memo that said CIA waterboarding didn’t constitute torture. Wallach noted that at one of the most well-known Pacific theater post-war trials -- The Tokyo War Crimes Trials by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East -- the records show water torture was generally inflicted in two ways. In one method, the victim was restrained on his back and water was poured on a cloth that had been placed over his nose and mouth. In other cases, a prisoner would be tied to a ladder and slid into a tub of water until he almost drowned. During a 1947 war crimes trial in Yokohama, Wallach wrote that several officials of a Japanese prison camp were convicted of two incidents of strapping down U.S. prisoners and forcing water up their noses and in their mouths. Supporters of the President George W. Bush-era interrogation techniques have said that the CIA’s waterboarding was not as harsh as the torture used by Japanese soldiers. Bush adviser Karl Rove said in a Dec. 14 Fox News interview that in Japan’s case, the method was used to drown the person. Rove said the CIA version was merely done to inflict panic and fear rather than pain and suffering. Wallach, in his essay, saw little difference between Imperial Japan’s use of the procedure and its modern iteration under former president Bush. The judge took issue with media reports that the technique merely simulates drowning saying "waterboarding is real drowning that simulates death." We contacted three other war crimes analysts who echoed Wallach’s finding that the U.S. prosecuted Japanese soldiers for offenses that included waterboarding. The next step, in evaluating Scott’s claim, is determining whether the U.S. executed any Japanese soldiers who waterboarded prisoners. David J. Cohen, the founder of the War Crimes Studies Center at the University of California at Berkeley, said the U.S. military convicted Japanese POW camp officials for a wide range of offenses from severe beatings, to exposing prisoners to extreme temperatures. "There were death sentences for torture, and that torture typically consisted of multiple forms of mistreatment, of which water torture was considered one of the most severe," Cohen said in an email. Wallach, in his essay, wrote that six Japanese generals who ordered and permitted water torture were sentenced to death. He added, however, that those generals were also convicted of many other war crimes -- including conspiracy, aggression and crimes against the peace. Yuma Totani, a history professor at the University of Hawaii, said she knows of two additional Japanese officers who were executed after U.S. military trials conducted from 1944 to 1946. "Both accused were found guilty on grounds that they disregarded their duty to take control of subordinate army units, which included kenpeitai (Japanese secret police) that was known to have used various torture methods against detainees at Fort Santiago, the kenpeitai interrogation center at Manila," Totani said in an email. "Waterboarding being one of the commonplace torture methods of kenpeitai, one could argue that these accused were convicted of a charge that included waterboarding as one of the torture methods, commonly applied by the members of their subordinate army units." Our ruling Scott said that after World War II, the U.S. tried, convicted, and in some cases executed Japanese soldiers for war crimes that included waterboarding. There’s little doubt that the U.S. tried and convicted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding. Six Japanese generals who allowed water torture were executed, although we note they faced a long list of additional charges. Scott qualified his statement to make clear he was referring to executed Japanese military members who faced a variety of war crime charges, including waterboarding, not that they were sentenced to death solely for that offense. We rate his statement True.	None	Bobby Scott	None	None	None	2015-01-12T00:10:00	2014-12-09	['Japan', 'World_War_II']
pomt-07456	(Dennis) Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/19/our-oregon/group-says-republican-senator-behind-call-drastic-/	It’s not even election season, but a recent political ad has generated quite a bit of buzz. Our Oregon, an organization backed by several unions and other progressive groups, released an ad attacking Rep. Dennis Richardson. The Central Point Republican has a target on his back because he sits on the Legislature's budget committee. In the ad, titled ‘Priorities,’ Our Oregon rips into Richardson for ignoring seniors and children. Here’s the ad’s text in full: "It's tough out there for middle class families. But Dennis Richardson and the Republicans voted to give tax breaks to corporations. Now Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities. But what could be more important than the health and safety of seniors and our children's future. call your legislators. tell them to get their priorities straight." There’s a lot in there -- most all of it the House Republicans find objectionable -- but, per our methods, we have to pick one statement. We’ll go with "Now Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities." The ad is referencing the proposed budget put forth by the Legislature’s budget committee, so let’s start there. First some background: The Legislature’s budget writing committee is composed of both representatives and senators. Generally, it’s led by two co-chairs, one from each chamber. This year, though, with an evenly divided House, there are three co-chairs: one from the Senate, two from the House. Richardson is the only Republican of the three men who control the committee. The two others are Democratic Sen. Richard Devlin from Tualatin and Rep. Peter Buckley from Ashland. Generally, after the Oregon governor releases a proposed budget, the co-chairs set to work crafting their own. The Legislature then spends time adjusting the proposals to create something that will pass both chambers and win the governor’s signature. This time around, the co-chairs -- after considerable negotiation -- presented a framework budget of about $14.6 billion. The budget actually offers schools some $140 million more than what Gov. John Kitzhaber suggested in his own proposal. (All told, school funding will remain flat -- it’s not being cut. Of course, the cost of education rises each year, meaning Oregon won’t get the same amount of services for the same amount of money in the next biennium as it did in the current. Human services, meanwhile, will face a shortfall as a result of lost stimulus money.) Somewhat controversially, the co-chairs decided to leave $444 million in reserve funds alone. Unions, and many Democratic lawmakers, feel that cash should be used now. The funds, they say, were meant to help out in bad times; these are bad times. Others believe it offers a cushion. If the burgeoning economic recovery stalls, the state will have some money to fall back on. Without the cash on hand, the state would need to reduce services. Any guess where Our Oregon stands on the issue? Yep, they think the co-chairs should be tapping into that reserve. Hence the ad. With that in mind, there are a few things wrong with the ad. Most important: This is not just Richardson's doing. Sure, he had a seat at the negotiating table. But the ultimate proposal was a bipartisan effort. To single him out isn’t accurate. At least two others ultimately decided that, for the purposes of compromise, the Legislature should set aside some cash for an even rainier day. As Harry Esteve recently reported in The Oregonian: "He and his fellow co- chairs, Sen. Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, and Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, argued for a hefty cushion of reserves, worried that recent hikes in oil prices could spur another recession. If the economy improves, dollars could be added to the budget when the Legislature meets again next year, they said during a Capitol news conference." That’s right, all three men -- two Democrats, one Republican -- were there selling the legislation. We called Our Oregon to ask about the discrepancy here. Scott Moore, the spokesman for the organization, said the co-chair proposal "was an agreement signed by the Democratic co-chairs basically under duress." He pointed to a House Democrats press releasewhen the budget proposal was unveiled that begins by pledging to "advocate for using a greater share of the $444 million in reserves" and then a Senate Republican releasethat says they are "generally positive about the new direction and tone set by the state budget proposal." (Two House Democrats have since introduced two bills that would tap into those reserves giving an addition $100 million to schools from the Education Stability Fund and $75 million to health care and public safety from the Rainy Day Fund.) "There's clearly a great deal of support among the Republican caucus," Moore said. House Democrats seem to think funding needs to be higher. While that may be true, it still doesn’t make this proposal any more Dennis Richardson’s than it does Peter Buckley’s or Richard Devlin’s. What’s more the Senate Democrats recently voted unanimously in favor of the education spending bill that mirrored the co-chairs’ proposal. As the House Republican spokesman Nick Smith says, "The levels of spending in the education budget, human services, public safety, each of the areas that are pointed out in this television ad, were all the result of bipartisan negotiation and compromise." We agree. Sure, these next two years will be harder for social services and public education -- but that’s a result of an anemic economy not a cut-happy Republican. Moreover, this budget represents a consensus, not one man’s vision. We find the claim that "Richardson wants to make drastic cuts to services we depend on: schools, home care for seniors, even public safety -- all so Richardson can keep more than $440 million in unspent funds for his political priorities" to be False.

pomt-13376	Maggie Hassan "missed nearly every university system board meeting."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/sep/28/national-republican-senatorial-committee/has-maggie-hassan-missed-nearly-every-trustee-meet/	With New Hampshire students perennially saddled with one of the highest tuition rates in the country, Republicans are using higher education to attack Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat who is challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte for her Senate seat this November. An ad put out by the National Republican Senatorial Committee reminds viewers that Granite State students attending New Hampshire’s public colleges will pay more than in-state students in basically every other state in the country. "Hassan raised college tuition making New Hampshire the highest in America," the narrator says, "Today, New Hampshire students are leaving to find affordable education, taking jobs with them." The ad suggests that Hassan has been oblivious as the situation reaches a crisis point. "Hassan missed nearly every University system board meeting. Maggie Hassan failed our students. She just hasn’t done her job," the ad concludes. The line was repeated again by New Hampshire Republican Party chairman Jennifer Horn on Sept. 16, after Hassan publicly criticized the University of New Hampshire for spending $1 million that a former librarian donated to the school to fund a video scoreboard for their football stadium. "Just like a typical Washington politician, Hassan issues indignant statements when it's politically convenient, but doesn't bother to show up when it actually matters," Horn said in a statement which blasted Hassan for her "excessive absences." PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check out Hassan’s attendance record for the university system board meetings. As governor, Hassan is an ex-officio member of the 27-member board of trustees that oversees the University System of New Hampshire. She can make motions and vote at meetings. The USNH oversees the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Granite State College and Keene State College. The board of trustees is responsible for strategic planning, setting policies, and ensuring the system’s financial health. It usually meets about four times a year, excepting special meetings. Looking back at the minutes, the Republicans are correct: Hassan has missed every single USNH board meeting since she took office, except one on June 28, 2013, when she briefly called in and made a motion to freeze tuition, according to meeting minutes provided by a USNH official. On the other hand, skipping trustee meetings isn’t unusual for a New Hampshire governor. Hassan’s predecessor, former Gov. John Lynch, a fellow Democrat, also made it to a single meeting -- on February 16, 2006 -- during his eight-year tenure as governor. Former Gov. Craig Benson, a Republican who served a single two-year term before Lynch, doesn’t appear to have attended a meeting at all, although meeting minutes for 2004, his second year in office, appear to be partially missing. None of these governors were necessarily shirking their responsibilities. Former USNH Chancellor Edward MacKay said he recalled governors going back to Hugh Gallen -- a Democrat who served from 1979 to 1982 -- attending "at least one" meeting during their tenure, but added that they "focused their time on broader issues facing the state and the associated management duties." The governor’s job is a big one, MacKay said, adding that it’s commonly believed that the day-to-day running of the USNH is better left to those with the time to focus on it. "In New Hampshire, the governor has very limited staff and has many more operational responsibilities than is the case in many states," said MacKay, who is currently the Higher Education Division Director at the New Hampshire Department of Education. "There is an expectation the governor will need to focus on those duties and the chair of the USNH and/or the chancellor will inform the governor of critical policy issues." Our ruling The National Republican Senatorial Committee says Maggie Hassan "missed nearly every university system board meeting." The governor is a sitting member of the University System of New Hampshire’s board of trustees, which gives her the power to make motions and vote. Hassan missed all but one meeting during her tenure as governor, and even the meeting she participated in came via phone call. That said, Hassan’s behavior is not out of place -- previous governors’ attendance has been similarly sparse, producing little expectation that the state’s chief executive will attend the meetings as a rule. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	National Republican Senatorial Committee	None	None	None	2016-09-28T11:49:38	2016-09-08	['None']
pomt-02474	Says Alex Sink "supported higher sales taxes."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/feb/21/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-alex-sink-supported-higher-sales-/	U.S. House candidate David Jolly is largely refraining from direct attacks against Alex Sink’s background as a banker, state chief financial officer and gubernatorial candidate. His supporters from the Republican Party of Florida, however, have had no such qualms. In a slew of campaign fliers and TV commercials, the GOP have hammered at the former CFO’s record, particularly on taxes. In a mailer that showed up in Pinellas County mailboxes around Feb. 17, 2014, the party said Sink "supported higher sales taxes, property taxes, water taxes and taxes on cable TV." We’ve already covered the claim about water and cable taxes, finding it Mostly True. But what about sales taxes? Give us a minute, and we’ll ring that one up, too. A taxing claim Republicans turned to Sink’s one term as Florida’s CFO, from 2007 to 2010, to find the basis for this attack. The mailer cites a Dec. 16, 2008, story from the Palm Beach Post about state lawmakers calling a special session to deal with an expected $2.3 billion budget shortfall as the Great Recession took hold of the state. The story said, "Democrats including Sink have asked GOP leaders to consider raising taxes, consider repealing sales tax exemptions and reinstitute the intangibles tax." The Republican-led Legislature announced the two-week January session to deal with precipitously declining state revenues, which had already led to $7.4 billion in budget cuts from 2006. Even plugging the $2.3 billion hole during the special session would have left the state more than $5 billion in the hole the following year. When announcing the session, GOP lawmakers refused to address the deficit with tax or fee increases or the ratification of the gambling compact with the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and wanted to deal with the problem by cutting state services and transferring trust fund dollars. Sink, the state’s CFO, said the state’s tax system should be overhauled when legislators convened. "Every sales tax exemption ought to be back on the table, ought to have to see the light of day," Sink said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. "Somebody ought to stand up and defend why an exemption is fair and legitimate or it's not." Among the items that enjoyed sales tax exemptions at the time: fitness club memberships for hospitals, bottled water, magazines and newspapers ordered through the mail, charter boat fishing, high school and college sports team skyboxes, valet parking, photo finishing, pet grooming, lawn & landscaping services, racing dogs, Super Bowl tickets and ostrich feed. Ending exemptions on catalog and Internet orders were also part of the discussion. Sink had suggested ending some exemptions since at least 2007, but we didn’t find any particular item she singled out. Instead, Sink simply wanted legislators to consider the potential revenue streams that ending exemptions could bring. One bipartisan poll showed the state could have raised some $560 million in new revenues by closing exemptions. Legislators eschewed examining the tax system, opting instead to appropriate $700 million from a tobacco settlement endowment fund that paid for health care programs for children and the elderly. They also postponed $300 million in bonds for the Florida Forever land purchase program and cut about $600 million from public education and health care, among other actions, before the regular session dealt with an even larger deficit in March. We should note that closing tax loopholes is not only a Democratic idea in Florida. Republican Gov. Rick Scott, the head of the Republican Party in Florida, has said he is willing to support a move to start collecting sales tax on online purchases, so long as it is accompanied by equal tax cuts. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida accused Sink of having "supported higher sales taxes." They pointed specifically to her stance on discussing the repeal of some sales tax exemptions in the wake of falling tax revenues in 2008. The way the GOP words it, however, makes it seem as if Sink were seeking to make a broad-based tax hike. Actually, Sink was supporting a review of sales tax exemptions. While that is not exactly raising the sales tax, it does have the same repercussions as a higher tax on those groups and industries. Overall, though, Sink was asking the Legislature to consider ending sales tax exemptions for a host of interest groups, not supporting raising sales taxes for everyone. Without that context, the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08572	The GOP's "Pledge to America" includes "a 20 percent cut ... for education. ... Eight million kids would have their college aid slashed under this budget."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/27/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-gop-pledge-would-cut-education-/	Just days after House Republicans released a governing blueprint called "A Pledge to America," the White House took aim at the GOP platform. Speaking on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour on Sept. 26, 2010, David Axelrod, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, zeroed in on the Republican plan for education. "When you look at that Pledge to America, it is a complete echo of what was done before," Axelrod said. "It would borrow $700 billion to cut taxes for the very wealthy, add trillions of dollars to the deficits. It would unleash the special interests to be writing rules here on Capitol Hill again. And it would cut things like -- there's a 20 percent cut in there for education. We're talking about our economy. Education is the defense budget of the -- economic defense budget of the 21st century, and they're basically talking about disarmament. Eight million kids would have their college aid slashed under this budget. This isn't a prescription for economic growth; this is a prescription for surrender. We can't do that." We thought we'd check whether the House GOP really intends to cut education funding by 20 percent and whether 8 million students would see their aid "slashed." First, Axelrod wrongly said on This Week that the 20 percent cut comes from the GOP's "Pledge" document. Actually, that document doesn't address education policy -- there's not a single word in the 48-page document about education. When we mentioned this to the White House, a spokeswoman clarified that Axelrod's argument stemmed instead from a Sept. 8, 2010, proposal by House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, that Congress cut non-security-related discretionary spending to its fiscal year 2008 level. Boehner stood behind both the Pledge and the proposed discretionary spending cut, so we don't think it's misleading for Axelrod to link House Republicans to the discretionary spending cut. The White House also told us that Axelrod relied on an analysis of the Boehner proposal produced by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. This report said the Boehner proposal would result in a "21 percent cut in K-12 education funding would take more than $8 billion out of this area in fiscal year 2011." So let's look at how the Education Department budget would look if the Republican proposal took effect. Axelrod wasn't specific about which budget years he was comparing, so we'll offer three figures for the Education Department's proposed discretionary budget: Fiscal year 2011 (estimated): $49.7 million Fiscal year 2010 (estimated): $46.8 million Fiscal year 2008 (enacted): $37.9 million So, the Republican plan would cut the budget by 19 percent from its 2010 level and by 24 percent from its proposed 2011 level. So, Axelrod is in the correct range. We're prepared to offer him some leeway because the math is complicated by quirks in how budget items are categorized and by inconsistencies in how budget tables over the period are constructed. When we ran the White House's approach by Boehner's office, a spokesman said that they're based on a faulty assumption -- that the Boehner proposal would institute identical, across-the-board cuts for every department and program. In fact, the spokesman said, the proposal would be to set the entire discretionary budget to 2008 levels and then negotiate cuts in each program to meet that target. That's all well and good, but the fact is that Boehner's news release doesn't explain exactly how its cuts would be made. So, given the information available, we think it's reasonable for Axelrod to have based his claim on an across-the-board cut. Moreover, if Boehner's office is suggesting that under his proposal, the cuts in education could in fact be less than 20 percent, then by the same logic they could also end up higher than 20 percent. Ultimately, Axelrod wrongly attributes that to the Pledge, but he is right that Boehner has made such a proposal, and Axelrod's assumptions are reasonable. Now, on to the second claim -- that "eight million kids would have their college aid slashed under this budget." This claim is also tricky to evaluate, since there are several types of student loans and grants under the Education Department budget, some of which are considered discretionary spending (meaning they'd be subject to Boehner's proposed cut) and some of which are considered mandatory spending (which would not be subject to his cut). But we'll try our best to sort it out. There are four major types of discretionary student aid: Pell grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants, federal work-study grants and federal Perkins loans. If you add together the recipients of these four grants, the total is 10.9 million for fiscal year 2010 and 12 million for 2011. That would actually be more students than Axelrod suggests, but experts told us that these numbers could be inflated by students whose aid packages include funds from two or more of these programs. So Axelrod's 8,000 figure -- which happens to be the ballpark number of Pell grants, the largest of the four programs -- seems reasonable to us. One final question is whether it's fair to use the word "slashed" to describe a roughly 20 percent cut. We think a 20 percent cut is deep enough to justify that term. So where does this leave us? We'll grant that Boehner's camp has a right to dispute Axelrod's suggestion that the Pledge outlined a 20 percent cut. That document itself didn't mention education, but Boehner outlined a 20 percent cut. He never specified that it would be other than across the board until we contacted his office, so we think it's reasonable for Axelrod to conclude that education would be cut in line with the rest of federal agencies. Meanwhile, the percentage cut and the student aid recipient numbers that Axelrod cited strike us as fair estimates, given the complexities of calculating year-to-year budgetary numbers for federal agencies. On balance, we rate Axelrod's comment Half True.	None	David Axelrod	None	None	None	2010-09-27T18:16:55	2010-09-26	['United_States', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09315	The passage of the teacher tenure bill in the Fla. Legislature was like the health care bill in Congress because one party jammed it through.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/16/charlie-crist/SB6-Crist-veto-health-care/	In remarks shortly after vetoing Senate Bill 6, Gov. Charlie Crist admonished Republicans for pushing through the controversial teacher tenure bill without allowing amendments or a full and open debate. "This thing was rushed through," Crist said during a news conference announcing his veto April 15, 2010. "Quite frankly, it reminds me of what happened with the health care bill in Washington -- where members of my party criticized the Democrats for sort of jamming something down their throat. And then here about a month later after that happens, you know, the very same thing happens here in education. So it's the wrong process. It had laudable goals. It can be done right. And we have a duty to make sure it is done right." Crist said the passage of SB 6 reminded him of how the health care bill played out in Washington. We decided to check whether or not his memory betrayed him. Republicans argued during the final weeks of the health care debate that President Barack Obama's reforms were being pushed without regard for the concerns of the American people, or without input from Republicans, while criticizing Democrats for using a parliamentary tactic called reconciliation to avoid a potential filibuster in the U.S. Senate. Republicans offered last-minute amendments to either attempt to slow approval down, or force Democrats to take votes against measures that could be used against them in upcoming elections. Democrats rejected all of the amendments, and Congress ultimately approved health care reform without the vote of one Republican. In Florida, some of the same arguments have been made by Democrats, the state's largest teachers union and Crist. They said Republicans quashed debate and blocked amendments to ram the bill through the Legislature without the vote of one Democrat. To best dissect the claim, we decided to analyze apples-to-apples comparisons between the two pieces of legislation, inlcuding the length of the process, opportunities for public comment, opportunities for input and the level of bipartisan support. The health care bill that passed Congress and was signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, is actually a combination of different proposals passed by the House and Senate. The U.S. House of Representatives filed its original version of the health care bill, HR 3200, on July 14, 2009, and a second version, HR 3962, on Oct. 29, 2009. That bill passed 220-215 on Nov. 7. One Republican, Joseph Cao of Louisiana, voted with Democrats to approve the bill. Over in the Senate, a third incarnation of the health care bill, HR 3590, passed on Christmas Eve 2009 without a Republican vote. The two bills were eventually merged -- without any GOP support -- and signed into law by President Obama. The total process from bill filing to bill signing took more than eight months -- not necessarily quick. Compare that with the state teacher tenure bill. SB 6 was filed in the state Senate on March 1, 2010, and passed on March 24, by a vote of 21-17. All 13 Senate Democrats voted against the bill, along with four Republicans. The state House took up SB 6 on March 25 and passed it 15 days later by a vote of 64-55 (11 Republicans joined the state's 44 Democrats in opposition). Crist vetoed the bill on April 15, 2010. Total Democrats in support --- zero. Total time in the hopper -- 45 days. Opportunities for public comment People for and against SB 6 had four opportunities to directly address legislators. Public comment was allowed during Senate committee meetings March 10 and March 19, and two House committee meetings March 25 and April 19. The state teacher's union argued that the public hearings coincided with FCAT testing and then, spring break. Congress, meanwhile, held at least 100 town hall meetings across the country to discuss health care in the summer of 2009. The conservative Web site Newsmax published a list of the hearings scheduled as of Aug. 12, 2009. They counted more than 140 all together. President Obama and members of his administration also held town hall meetings to discuss health care reform. The White House held regional forums in five states in March and April 2009. Obama participated in a health care town hall in Wisconsin in June 2009, a tele-town hall with AARP in July and a forum in New Hampshire in August 2009. Then there were health care rallies in Ohio and Virginia in March 2010. Opportunities for input The federal health care bill included lengthy debate in both the House and Senate, with each chamber passing a bill incorporating that body's priorities. Concessions were made for U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., to ensure there would be no public funding of abortion. And though maybe not significant, Republican amendments were added to the bill. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions adopted 159 amendments offered by Republicans. Only two of them, however, were significant or controversial enough to merit roll call votes. One of those two affected the manufacture of biologics medication and another required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option (which was ultimately scrapped). Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, told PolitiFact that 132 of the 159 were for "technical amendments" and that it was a misnomer to call them proof of bipartisanship. In the House Energy and Commerce Committee, 16 Republican amendments were adopted. But Republicans said only one amendment was major, and none changed the core of the legislation. In the Education and Labor Committee, six of the 17 amendments offered by Republicans were adopted. Again, Republicans said the amendments were largely technical. White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield said 170 GOP amendments were accepted into the final bill that passed. Conversely, the passage of SB 6 was orchestrated -- particularly by the Florida House -- to prevent alterations to the bill. Republicans in the House waited until the Senate passed SB 6 before filing identical bill language. (The Senate version included an amendment allowing principals to factor in advanced degrees in their performance reviews.) Florida House Speaker Larry Cretul said he hoped there would be no amendments to the House bill. The reason? If the House changed the bill, it would have to return to the Senate for a second vote. "We hope that there won't be any amendments,'' Cretul told the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald. "What the Senate sent us was a pretty good work product.'' A majority of Republicans in the House rejected 19 amendments before passing SB 6. The amendments would have required school districts to set salaries at or higher than the national average, allowed school districts to use years of service or advanced degrees as a factor in setting pay, and force members of the Florida Legislature to teach nine weeks in a public school before the teacher pay plan could become effective. Republicans said the bill wasn't perfect, but wanted Crist to sign it anyway. "I understand it wasn't a perfect bill," said Rep. Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. "But I thought it laid a good foundation." And Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, said: “This is not a perfect bill; there are things in this bill that will change. It is a framework for going forward.” State Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, also suggested the Legislature could write a follow-up "glitch bill," if Crist had particular problems with provisions of SB 6. Our ruling Back to Crist's original statement. In vetoing SB 6, he said the process in the Legislature was similiar to the one Republicans criticized Democrats for using in Washington to pass the health care bill. In particular, Crist said both bills were sort of "jamming something down (people's) throat." He's right that neither the federal health care bill or SB 6 passed with a single vote from the party out of power. But turns out there actually was more debate in Washington about the health care bill, than there was in Tallahassee about SB 6. Congress and the president held more than 100 town halls to discuss health care with voters while Florida legislators had four public hearings. And while the White House says 170 GOP amendments were included in the final health care bill, albeit largely technical in nature, Republicans in the Florida House blocked every amendment offered by Democrats when considering SB 6. State GOP leaders also orchestrated a plan to avoid having to send the bill back to the Senate for a second vote or even conference over different bills. SB 6 meets our definition of jamming a bill through, which is good for Crist. What's bad for him, however, is that the debate over the federal health care bill was actually more collegial. We have to rate Crist's statement Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-04-16T19:01:38	2010-04-15	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-14200	The Human Rights Campaign is "more powerful than the NRA."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/21/pat-mccrory/nc-gov-pat-mccrory-under-fire-hb2-says-human-right/	When one thinks of the country’s most powerful lobbying groups, acronyms like NRA, AIPAC and AARP spring to mind. So do phrases like Big Pharma, Big Oil and Wall Street. During an appearance April 17 on NBC’s "Meet The Press," North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory made the argument that the Human Rights Campaign is also among the most powerful lobbies in the United States. "The Human Rights Council, my gosh, they’re more powerful than the NRA," McCrory said, meaning the Human Rights Campaign and the National Rifle Association. The Human Rights Campaign, or HRC, is a major player in the opposition to North Carolina’s controversial new law, House Bill 2, which limits LGBT rights in public accommodations — and which McCrory was on national television to defend. "They are putting on a lot of pressure instead of having good dialogue," McCrory said. The HRC is the country’s largest gay rights group. It has led the charge for gay marriage and for the types of LGBT discrimination protections that HB2 prohibited cities in North Carolina from making. But has the group really eclipsed the NRA, an oft-cited stereotype of a powerful lobbying group that can shape public policy and opinion? McCrory says it has. And in the last few days, that claim has been picked up as a talking point by supporters of HB2. Measuring political power It would be big news if McCrory was right. Debates over gay rights, as with gun rights, are a large part of modern political discourse. We don’t know what criteria McCrory was using, if any, to make his claim. "Meet The Press" host Chuck Todd didn’t ask him to elaborate. When we asked McCrory’s campaign about his rationale, spokesman Ricky Diaz called it a "ridiculous question" and declined to answer. We also asked both the HRC and the NRA whether they agreed with McCrory. The NRA did not respond, and the HRC declined to answer. There are many ways to measure a group’s strength. We asked an expert, UNC-Chapel Hill political science professor Frank Baumgartner, who has written multiple books on special interest groups and lobbying. He listed three main ways to measure influence: Money and resources, "cultural resonance" and record of success or failure. Baumgartner said he believes McCrory’s comparison is "false or substantially exaggerated." But let’s look into the numbers to see if they back that up. Money Money is especially important in modern politics because of the Citizens United ruling that McCrory mentioned, which allows for unlimited political spending. In 2014, according to federal tax filings, the NRA and its foundation had revenue of $356.1 million, compared with $51.2 million for the HRC and its foundation. Money allows interest groups to hire lobbyists, contribute directly to politicians and political groups or take part in what’s known as outside spending – TV ads, mailers and other political initiatives. In the 2014 election cycle, according to the Center For Responsive Politics, the NRA’s political spending was 7.5 times greater than the HRC’s ($36.8 million to $4.8 million). In the 2012 cycle, the NRA spent five times as much ($26.9 million to $5.1 million). In both cycles, the NRA spent more on lobbying than the HRC spent on lobbying, contributions and outside spending combined. For outside spending in particular, the NRA spent about $350 for every $1 the HRC spent. "Cultural resonance" How do you measure this? It sounds intangible, but there are ways to break it into specific, quantifiable pieces. And in everything we looked at, the NRA came out on top. Membership, magazine subscriptions, Google searches, social media following and official government mentions all show the NRA’s presence is anywhere from 2 to 10 times larger than the HRC’s. Both groups have magazines. The HRC’s goes to more than 350,000 homes, according to a group spokesman this week. According to the publishing group Alliance for Audited Media, the NRA’s three magazines had a combined circulation in 2015 of more than 3.5 million. As for membership, both have been accused in the past of inflating their numbers. Take it with a grain of salt, but the NRA claims 4.5 million members compared with 1.5 million for the HRC. The NRA also has a larger audience on social media – 4.8 million Facebook likes and 345,000 Twitter followers, compared with 2.3 million Facebook likes and 529,000 Twitter followers for the HRC. We also compared online searches, which indicate how interested people are in learning about the groups. When their Google searches over the last 12 years are graphed against each other, the HRC’s results show up as an almost flat line hovering just above 0. We used Google Trends to aggregate numerous terms related to both groups and map their relative popularity as compared with all other searches each month. The NRA is in red and the HRC is in blue. Even the HRC’s best month didn’t surpass the NRA’s worst month. We also counted how often they’re mentioned in congressional hearing transcripts and other documents listed by the U.S. Government Publishing Office search engine –1,408 results for "National Rifle Association" and 393 for "Human Rights Campaign." Reputation and success Baumgartner said he thinks this was the point McCrory was trying to make – on a group’s "ability to push public policy in a direction the group prefers." And again, Baumgartner said, the HRC doesn’t quite stack up. "I'd say Human Rights Campaign has had some success," he said. "But no, they would not compare to the long-run success of groups such as the NRA, the Realtors, the petroleum industry, the Chamber of Commerce and many others." The NRA is famous for its clout and success in Congress. The HRC, on the other hand, has achieved most of its biggest victories – gay marriage, gay adoption rights and the invalidation of anti-sodomy laws – at the Supreme Court. The HRC has existed since 1980. For most of that time, one of its top priorities has been a federal LGBT anti-discrimination law. Efforts to pass such laws state-by-state have been mostly unsuccessful, as we explored in a previous fact check. On the national level, friendly legislators have introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA, in nearly every Congress since 1994. It has failed each time, despite polling that shows about three quarters of Americans support such laws. The NRA has done the opposite, persuading Congress to repeatedly kill legislation that has even broader public support than ENDA does. Even though about 90 percent of Americans support background checks on gun buyers – previous PolitiFact rulings have found a range of 85 to 93 percent – the federal Fix Gun Checks Act has been voted down several times since 2011. It would allow for universal background checks, and the NRA is strongly opposed to it. As for the HRC, it hasn’t been totally unsuccessful in Congress. The group successfully pushed for a 2009 law that expanded federal hate crime definitions to include LGBT status. And what about outside of government, in the corporate world? It’s undeniable that the HRC’s influence there is growing. The group started ranking how "LGBT friendly" companies were in 2002 in what it calls its Corporate Equality Index. About a dozen received a perfect score that year. In 2016, more than 400 companies did. And many businesses have followed the HRC in criticizing North Carolina over HB2. But that hasn’t meant much so far. Key legislators have said they have no plans to repeal HB2 or make major changes to it, despite the pressure. On the other hand, the NRA has seen many of its initiatives passed in North Carolina, like 2013 law that loosened restrictions on concealed carry. Our ruling McCrory said the main group against HB2, the Human Rights Campaign, is "more powerful than the NRA." It’s a strong claim, given the NRA’s reputation for power and influence, and even the HRC spokesman was unwilling to embrace it. That’s not to say the HRC isn’t powerful. It’s a multimillion-dollar organization and the country’s largest gay rights group. But it doesn’t have the resources, adherents or success rate that the NRA does. In every way we tried to define influence, the HRC doesn’t even come close to the NRA’s level of power. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a1af1e68-c8d1-4ecb-a7d5-36cb928ae38a	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-04-21T18:37:24	2016-04-17	['None']
pomt-02207	"In Wisconsin, a woman only earns 80 cents for every $1 a man earns."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/23/mary-burke/scott-walker-opponent-mary-burke-says-working-wisc/	Marking what President Barack Obama proclaimed as National Equal Pay Day, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke uttered a claim that many politicians have made in one form another at the state or national level. "Women deserve equal pay for equal work. It's just that simple," Burke, a Madison School Board member, said in an April 8, 2014 news release. "In Wisconsin, a woman only earns 80 cents for every dollar a man earns -- and pay discrimination doesn't just hurt our families, it hurts our economies, too." Let's take a look. Similar claims In rating a number of pay-gap claims, we and our PolitiFact colleagues have found that wording is crucial. Two of those fact-checks help put Burke's claim into perspective. Former Dane County executive Kathleen Falk, while campaigning for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination to challenge Walker in the 2012 recall election, said Wisconsin women "are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job." The key phrase was "same job." We rated the statement False, finding that Falk misquoted the very report she relied on. The report said that -- among all men and women in Wisconsin working all sorts of jobs -- women earned 81 cents for every dollar earned by men. Burke's claim, in contrast, is more similar to one made by Obama. "You know, today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns," Obama said in his January 2014 State of the Union speech. "That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work." PolitiFact National rated Obama's statement Mostly True. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our colleagues found, women who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 made 77 cents for every $1 men earned across the country. The comparison includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation. Our colleagues noted, however, the existence of a pay gap doesn’t necessarily mean the gap is caused by discrimination. Work by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, for example, found that one factor is that women more often choose lower-paying jobs such as receptionists, nurses and teachers, while men more often pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers. Wisconsin figures So what's the situation in Wisconsin? Three organizations -- the Institute for Women's Policy Research, the National Partnership for Women & Families and the American Association of University Women -- also cited 2012 census data as the latest available. Those figures show Wisconsin women earned 78 cents per $1 earned by men. The American Association of University Women said in a March 2014 report that the median annual earnings for Wisconsin women working full time year round was $36,535 -- 78 percent of the $46,898 earned by men. (The median is the middle number -- in other words, half of the workers earned more than that amount and half earned less.) Commenting on the pay gap at the national level, the association said career choices explain some of the pay gap. But even after accounting for college major, occupation, hours worked and other factors, the association said, 7 percent of the gap nationally between men and women college graduates remained unexplained one year after graduation. So, there is evidence that Wisconsin women earn 78 cents per $1 of what men earn, although the role discrimination might play is not clear. Our rating Burke said: "In Wisconsin, a woman only earns 80 cents for every $1 a man earns." Her claim is slightly conservative, in that census data put the figure at 78 cents. It's worth noting that the gap is not necessarily due to discrimination -- a conclusion some might have drawn because Burke's statement made reference to pay discrimination. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Mary Burke	None	None	None	2014-04-23T05:00:00	2014-04-08	['Wisconsin']
pomt-11130	Republican "sabotage" cost 3.2 million people coverage in 2017.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/01/protect-our-care/did-republican-sabotage-cost-32-million-their-heal/	Just in time for the midterms, an image is circulating on social media about a massive rise in the uninsured under Republican leadership. A tweet from Health Care Voters of Nevada featured a graphic with the title, "The cost of sabotage." "3.2 million Americans lost coverage in the first year of the Republican war on health care," the image said. The web graphic is part of a project called Protect Our Care, a coaltion of groups that aims to preserve the Affordable Care Act. We looked into that 3.2 million number and found it falls at the high end of estimates. In addition, while Republican efforts to repeal and undermine the Affordable Care Act did the law no favors, their impact in 2017 is difficult to gauge. A question of statistical significance The number comes from the polling firm Gallup. In January, Gallup found that 12.2 percent of the population said they were uninsured during the last quarter of 2017. That was 1.3 percentage points higher than the same period in the year before. The survey group was people age 18 and older. "That 1.3 point increase represents an estimated 3.2 million Americans who entered the ranks of the uninsured in 2017," Gallup wrote. So there’s hard data behind the figure. However, there are other estimates out there, and they raise questions about the 3.2 million figure. The strongest counterweight to the Gallup result comes from the National Health Interview Survey, an ongoing program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest government study showed a rise in the number of uninsured of 700,000. But the report said that was "not significantly different from 2016." That was for all ages. The picture for 18- to 64-year-olds was more complicated. The fraction of uninsured went from 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent. But taking into account the study’s margin of error (about .3 percent), the results were a statistical dead-heat. One other survey puts the Gallup figure on the high end. The New York-based Commonwealth Fund, a private health policy group, also measures insurance coverage. For its survey group of 19- to 64-year-olds, it reported that, "an estimated 4 million people lost coverage." However, that change took place over a longer period than the other studies, from early 2016 to March 2018, effectively a full two years. Republicans were in charge in Washington for only about half of that span. Looking at past Commonwealth Fund surveys, about half, or 2 million people, were added to the ranks of the uninsured on the Republicans’ watch. Sorting out the results When it comes to precision, researchers give the nod to the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey. Praise comes from many quarters, including Sara Collins, the head of the Commonwealth Fund’s work on health care coverage. She said her group can give an early view of trends, but the greatest accuracy lies with the CDC. "The large sample size of CDC’s National Health Interview Survey yields an estimate of change with smaller margins of error, and thus more definitive point estimates," Collins told us. The CDC reached over 78,000 people. By comparison, the Commonwealth Fund based its results on about 2,400 responses and Gallup’s was about 25,000. Collins added that within the limits of the Commonwealth Fund’s survey, they did not find statistically significant differences either between 2016 and 2017 or between 2017 and 2018. So in that respect, their results track with the government findings. Why do the results vary? For several reasons, the experts say. There are differences in the studies’ age groups and their response rates. Perhaps the biggest wild card is the timing of the surveys. Gallup calls people during each quarter, while the government collects data throughout the year. RAND analyst Christine Eibner put together this table with the uninsured rates for working age adults over the past two years from the three groups. (Commonwealth covers two years.) Gallup CDC Commonwealth 2016 10.9% 12.4% 12.7% 2017 12.2% 12.8% 15.5% Eibner said the key to Gallup’s estimated 3.2 million more people without insurance in 2017 lies in its 2016 figure. That’s when it’s markedly lower than the other surveys that year. But Eibner said that could be an artifact of people rushing to get insurance at the end of the year after the election. Gallup’s lower rate in 2016 would translate into a bigger jump in the uninsured when it gathered data in 2017. Eliot Fishman, director of health policy at Families USA, a partner in the Protect Our Care coalition, said given that all three surveys show a rise in the uninsured, the overall trend is well supported by the data. Republican actions The presumption in the claim is that Republicans are responsible. There’s no question that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans worked hard and nearly repealed Obamacare. Trump canceled about $10 billion in reimbursements to insurance companies, a move that drove up premiums. And the Republican tax law did away with the individual mandate penalty, which further roiled insurance markets. But insurance analyst Cynthia Cox at the Kaiser Family Foundation said the country has yet to see the full impact of all of that. "It’s worth keeping in mind that the year in question -- 2017 -- was before most of the changes from the Trump administration and Congress went into effect," Cox said. Jean Abraham at the University of Minnesota also urged caution. "I don't believe it is possible to causally attribute the increase in uninsurance to the actions of the GOP in a specific or direct way, given the large number of factors and changes occurring simultaneously," Abraham said. She noted that rising premiums were in play before Republicans took power. That made health insurance in the individual market harder to afford for about the 8 million people who received no subsidy. On the other hand, Abraham said Republican actions made the markets less affordable. Our ruling A graphic from the coalition Protect Our Care said that Republican sabotage had led to a rise of 3.2 million in the ranks of the uninsured. That specific figure is far from certain. A Gallup estimate backs up that figure, and a study by the Commonwealth Fund found an increase, but a somewhat smaller one. The government assessment deemed most reliable by health analysts found a small increase, but not one that was significantly different from the year before. On net, an increase is plausible, but the scale is hard to determine right now. As for Republican responsibility, they did make insurance less affordable in the individual market, but the full impact of their policies did not come in 2017. Given the complexity of health insurance, they bear some responsibility but not all of it. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: A previous version of this article described the web graphic as the work of Families USA. The actual creator was the coaltion that Families USA belongs to.

pomt-05109	Says U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson said he wants to "do away with Medicare."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/28/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-says-thompson-wants-do-away-medicare/	U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic congresswoman from Madison, painted Republicans as enemies of the elderly in a red-meat speech at a convention of liberal bloggers and activists. "As progressives let’s be clear -- on Social Security we are committed to protecting it, not privatizing it," Baldwin told Netroots Nation during its June 7, 2012, meeting in Providence, R.I. "And on Medicare we are committed to strengthening it, not ending it as we know it." She slammed former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, the frontrunner among four GOP Senate contenders, for his work on behalf of drug and insurance companies after leaving the cabinet of President George W. Bush. And Baldwin dropped a stunner into her remarks about the ex-guv: "Just this week, one of my prospective opponents, Tommy Thompson, went to a tea party event and compared Medicare to welfare, and said he wanted, quote, to do away with Medicare," Baldwin said. She added, with a touch of outrage: "Do away with something the middle class has worked for, has paid for and has earned." That will get your attention -- whether you’re in Medicare, nearing eligibility or even years away. Did Thompson really express a desire to end Medicare, the long-running government-run health care program for seniors funded by taxes that come out of workers’ paychecks? Thompson’s comments As backup, Baldwin’s campaign cited Thompson’s remarks at a June 4, 2012, gathering of the Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty. The Oconomowoc-based group decries excessive government and has a stated goal of "demolishing the growing, socialist ‘nanny state’ and its programs and legislation, re-instituting personal responsibility and the traditional values of work, merit, integrity, honesty, innovation, accountability, civic participation and civility." The Democratic Party filmed the speech and Baldwin’s campaign provided a copy to us. A brief portion of the speech is linked on the website of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. At the event, Thompson said Medicare will be broke within a decade and the only way to save it is to give people who turn 55 starting in 2022 a choice of traditional Medicare or purchasing health insurance with a subsidy from the federal government. If that sounds a lot like the plan from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, to reform Medicare, it should. Thompson has endorsed Ryan’s plan. Baldwin used cautious words when she described the Ryan plan, saying it would end Medicare "as we know it." Others have claimed it would simply "end" Medicare, which PolitiFact National named the 2011 Lie of the Year. So, Thompson’s remarks -- in a way -- turn the claim on its head. It’s a Republican suggesting he would end Medicare. There is another piece of background: Thompson didn’t say it at the event, but he told the Journal Sentinel in 2011 he firmly believes seniors will choose the private insurance option under Ryan’s plan over government-run care. Of government-run healthcare, he said he’s "always opposed" it. Back to the speech. Thompson did, as Baldwin claimed, wrap his argument for Medicare reform in the language of wiping it away and starting fresh. First, he harkened back to his days as Wisconsin governor, and his first-in-the-nation move to replace welfare with a work requirement. He told the audience the United States should "change Medicare and Medicaid like I did welfare." (We previously rated as Mostly True Thompson’s claim that he "ended welfare" in Wisconsin). Then there was this line, the one Baldwin latched onto: "Who better than me, (who’s) already finished one of the entitlement programs and come up with programs to do away with Medicaid and Medicare." We asked the Thompson campaign about the claim and they said it was not a misstatement by the candidate. But campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir offered this somewhat contradictory explanation: Thompson used the phrase "doing away with" in the context of "changing" Medicare, not eliminating it, he said. The speech itself is hard to decipher. Was Thompson describing his position in support of Ryan’s plan as a way of fundamentally changing Medicare? Was his characterization meant to apply to changes he helped make in Medicare when he was the U.S. secretary of health and human services? In his 2011 remarks, Thompson said government-run Medicare could disappear if people are allowed to opt out of it. Is that what he meant? Whatever his meaning, it’s clear that Thompson was comfortable uttering the phrase "doing away with Medicare" in the middle of a recitation of his views on transforming the program. At the same time, it’s clear that further into the speech, after the statement in question, Thompson said he was interested in "saving" it from fiscal extinction. He also framed his views as wanting to "change" Medicare, though in the context of his elimination of welfare in Wisconsin. Baldwin doesn’t provide those facts. Her comment that Thompson would "do away with something the middle class has worked for, has paid for and has earned" suggests Medicare will be taken away without any option. Our rating Baldwin claimed that Thompson "said he wanted, quote, to do away with Medicare." He did say it, acknowledges he did not misspeak, and Baldwin accurately repeats the phrase. Still, Baldwin leaves out evidence from Thompson’s own mouth that Thompson is talking about a dramatic transformation of Medicare in order to save government health care assistance to seniors, not end it outright. The Truth-O-Meter definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We think that fits Baldwin’s claim.

pomt-00270	Says Jacky Rosen "voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the United States."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/02/senate-leadership-fund/gop-super-pac-ad-skips-over-jacky-rosens-yes-vote-/	A Republican super PAC ad faults Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen for failing to take a tough line on criminals who try to sneak across the border. The $1.3 million ad buy from the Senate Leadership Fund is on the air and on the web statewide in Nevada’s U.S. Senate race. The ad opens with images of MS-13 gang members. The violent criminal organization runs rampant in El Salvador and is a threat in communities across the United States. "MS-13 violent gang members," a narrator says. "They exploit immigration loopholes and commit vicious crimes in the U.S. Jacky Rosen, she voted against Kate’s Law, which would close immigration loopholes and help stop criminal illegal immigrants from re-entering the U.S." The words "Rosen voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the U.S.," play across the screen. We gave it a fact-check. Understanding Kate’s Law Kate’s Law came after 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle died in San Francisco from a shot by a Mexican national with seven felony convictions who had been deported five times. The tragic death in 2015 inflamed the debate over immigration and sanctuary cities. In June 2017, a group of four House members introduced Kate’s Law. The bill imposed stricter penalties on people who had been deported or sent back before and tried to sneak back. Someone with three misdemeanors on their record, or a felony, could face up to 10 years behind bars. Those who had served time in an American jail faced ever increasing penalties, depending on the length of the original sentence. For a two-and-half year sentence, the maximum was 15 years. For a five-year sentence, the maximum was 20 years. And for the worst crimes, such as murder or rape, the maximum went to 25 years. "It is already a federal crime to enter the United States without the federal government’s permission," said César Hernández, associate professor of law at the University of Denver. "Right now, the maximum prison sentence is 20 years. Kate’s Law would increase that to 25 years, but only for people with prior convictions for a small set of serious crimes." Kate’s Law passed the House by a 257-167 vote in June 2017 but died in the Senate. Rosen voted against it. Kate’s Law targeted repeat immigration offenders and created ever more stringent penalties based on an offender’s past felony sentences. Under current law, the maximum penalty for any re-entry attempt is two years. Under Kate’s Law, after three attempts, the maximum rose to 10 years. It also expanded the universe of misdemeanors from drug-related under current law, to any misdemeanor, which could include offenses as common as traffic violations. "It will discourage people from entering the United States illegally, particularly when they have already entered illegally earlier and have been convicted of a crime for doing so," said the bill’s main sponsor, Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., in 2017. The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act Although Rosen voted against Kate’s Law, she was one of 11 Democrats who voted for the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act in September 2017. That bill made it easier for federal officials to detain and remove gang members. Under the bill, an official could act if he or she "knows or has reason to believe that such person is or has been a member of a criminal gang or has participated in criminal gang activities." The measure provided broad latitude in defining gangs and if officials had any suspicions, the person would be ineligible for asylum, temporary protected status, or special treatment because they are under 18. The bill passed in the House in September 2017, but has yet to win Senate approval. Assessing Kate’s Law and gangs In White House press briefing, U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber said Kate’s Law would help prosecutors keep gang members off the streets. "What Kate's Law does is give us one more tool that is fairly easy to use, because we're not reliant upon witnesses who may be intimidated by the gangs or victimized by the gangs," Huber said. "This enables us to, based on a person's status and their criminal record and their deportation record, to simply prosecute them in federal court, obtain a prison sentence, and get them out of here." But gang expert Robert Bunker at the University of Southern California’s Safe Communities Institute said MS-13 gang members are a special case. Imprisonment is part of initiation. "Being in prison for a gang member is considered part of ‘making one's bones’ to gain street cred and status within the gang," Bunker told us. "So, unlike cartel members who may be deterred by facing a prison sentence, a gang member — such as an MS-13 one — is not going to be deterred by it. Further, if an MS-13 gang member from Central America was ordered by his clique leader or a higher up shot-caller, to journey to the United States, they would do so. Not following orders would get them severely beaten if not killed outright." Before Kate’s Law emerged, while deportations in general more or less held steady, people deported because of their criminal history declined. This chart comes from deportation proceedings gathered by Syracuse University’s TRAC project. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com There are two ways to read the numbers. It’s possible that immigrants with felonies drew less attention over the years (although during most of the period, Washington put more focus on them). But it’s also possible that current law has been effective, without the threat of Kate’s Law. Hernandez at the University of Denver said he’s not seen any study that shows a connection between increased penalties and reduced border crossings. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund said Rosen "voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the United States," citing Kate’s Law. Rosen did vote against Kate’s Law, which increased penalties for those trying to re-enter the country. However, the ad leaves out that Rosen voted in favor of another bill that specifically targeted the sort of gang members presented in the ad. The measure gave federal officers wide latitude in defining gang membership and empowered them to detain and remove any person they had reason to believe was involved with a gang. Rosen’s voting record undercuts the ad’s claim. We rate it Mostly False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Senate Leadership Fund	None	None	None	2018-10-02T15:09:44	2018-09-25	['United_States']
pomt-07661	"A new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/11/morgan-griffith/morgan-griffith-says-epa-treats-milk-spills-same-w/	U.S. Rep. H. Morgan Griffith is milking his opposition to the Environmental Protection Agency for every last drop. The Republican stressed his contempt for the agency throughout a heated campaign last fall in which Griffith unseated Democrat Rick Boucher, a 14-term congressman from coal-rich Southwest Virginia. In his victory speech, Griffith vowed to go to Washington and "fight to rein in the EPA." Since taking office, he has fired out a barrage of anti-EPA statements. In a February newsletter to constituents, Griffith claimed that new EPA rules treat milk spills the same way they treat oil spills. He titled the newsletter "Crying over spilt milk." "What do spilt milk and oil have in common?" he wrote. "Quite a bit, according to the EPA. In fact, a new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply with the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Program when dealing with spilt milk -- the same regulations oil and natural gas producers must follow. The EPA’s reasoning is that milk contains ‘a percentage of animal fats, which is a non-petroleum oil.’ It appears spilt milk is just as threatening as an oil spill." With visions of dairy farmers delicately dabbing milk off the wings of ducks, we looked into the claim. Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, said her boss’s information came from the EPA’s website. So we went there. Right away, we found problems with Griffith’s claim. The website says milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon. So this is hardly a "new ruling," as Griffith says. It has been in effect for 38 years. The EPA site says "since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of ‘oil’ from the Clean Water Act, which was authored by Congress." The website also notes the rule only applies to farms storing more than 1,320 gallons of oil or milk. So what’s new? According to the EPA, the only thing that comes close is a rule change it announced on Jan. 15, 2009. It goes in effect at the end of this month. The simple purpose of the change is to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. That’s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Here’s what the regulation says: "EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade "A" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance," or similar state laws. Translated into plain English, the rule means milk storage will no longer have to meet the EPA’s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. In Virginia it is illegal to sell "raw," or unpasteurized, milk, so the state’s dairy farmers should already be in compliance with the new standards. Raw milk is now legal for sale in 25 states, although 15 of those states only allow sales directly from a farm. So conceivably raw milk producers -- which are almost exclusively small operations, according to a group that advocates for raw milk -- might still need to comply with the SPCC rules. But this would affect only a very small fraction of total U.S. milk. Baffled by how Griffith could have this claim so mixed up, we went back to his office for additional information. The second time around his press secretary pointed us to a Jan. 27 editorial in The Wall Street Journal that makes virtually the same claim. The editorial wrongly said new EPA rules will apply to dairy farms and cover milk storage. The amended rule only applies to petroleum products -- gasoline, fuel oil and the like -- that are stored in large quantities on dairy farms. Let’s review our findings. Griffith claimed a "new ruling by the EPA would force dairy farmers to comply" with strict regulations for spills and leaks. He said the rules were the same as those enforced on oil and natural gas companies. In fact, these regulations have been in place for 38 years and are not new at all. The "new ruling" from the EPA, announced in 2009 and taking effect in a few weeks, actually excludes milk from the spill standards, giving dairy farmers fewer regulations to meet. That’s the exact opposite of what Griffith claims. Sure, Griffith got some of his information from an inaccurate editorial in The Wall Street Journal. But a congressman who is railing against a federal agency has the means to get his facts right. Griffith is dishing udder cow chips. We rate his statement False.

pomt-00784	Says Ted Cruz said, "There is no place for gays or atheists in my America. None. Our Constitution makes that clear."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/apr/08/facebook-posts/meme-facebook-says-ted-cruz-declared-no-place-gays/	Here we go again: A reader just pointed out a Facebook meme suggesting Texan Ted Cruz declared America constitutionally off limits to gays and atheists last month when he declared his candidacy for president. We recently found Pants on Fire a Facebook post saying the Canada-born Cruz, the Republican U.S. senator who announced his presidential candidacy at Liberty University in Virginia, had conveniently flip-flopped on each president needing to be born in the United States. Did not happen. The ‘no place’ Facebook post Now let’s turn to the Facebook post brought to our attention most recently: SOURCE: Facebook post, March 25, 2015 (noted by a PolitiFact reader April 2, 2015) The image had a tagline mentioning a Facebook page titled "Stop the World, The Teabaggers Want Off." Off we clicked, learning that Facebook page includes this disclaimer about its posts: "This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages." The afternoon we scrolled the page, we didn’t spot the Cruz meme. But the image and purported Cruz statement had been sent out by the group in this March 25, 2015, tweet: SOURCE: Twitter post, @StopTeabaggers, March 25, 2015 No confirmation in news stories The image did not put the statement in quotation marks. Still, the meme as a whole struck us as leaving the impression that Cruz said it. And it doesn’t look like he did. In fact, online searches and a check of the Nexis news database yielded no evidence Cruz, a Houston lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, has ever made a comment about the Constitution leaving no place for gays or atheists in his America. To our inquiry about the presented quotation, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said by email it’s "obviously false." Cruz’s speech declaring for president Next, we scrutinized a Washington Post transcript of Cruz’s March 23, 2015 speech declaring for president. In the speech, Cruz mentioned marriage once, gays and atheists not at all. On marriage, he said: "Instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values, imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life and to uphold the sacrament of marriage." Cruz didn’t mention atheists, but he emphasized religious faith before students at the university founded by the late Jerry Falwell, an evangelist. For instance, Cruz referred to "the God-given liberty of every American." He also said: "God’s blessing has been on America from the very beginning of this nation, and I believe God isn’t done with America yet." He closed: "I am honored to stand with each and every one of you courageous conservatives as we come together to reclaim the promise of America, to reclaim the mandate, the hope and opportunity for our children and our children’s children. We stand together for liberty. "This is our fight. The answer will not come from Washington. It will come only from the men and women across this country, from men and women, from people of faith, from lovers of liberty, from people who respect the Constitution. "It will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country, when the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great. We will get back and restore that shining city on a hill that is the United States of America." Other Cruz comments Finally, we looked into whether the meme’s quotations reflected on past Cruz comments. Cruz has repeatedly said he doesn’t want gay marriages to be legal, as the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, spells out in its "Republican Facts" web page titled: "Ted Cruz: Not a Fan of Pride Parades." In March 2012, Cruz was quoted by Peggy Fikac of the San Antonio Express-News saying: "I believe that engaging in homosexual conduct is a choice, and I do not believe that unelected judges should force states to adopt gay marriage, against the wishes of the people. Marriage is a fundamental building block of our society, and I have a proven record of standing and fighting to protect traditional marriage between one man and one woman." Cruz also has stressed his religious faith; he’s a Baptist, Tyler told us. And in spring 2014, Cruz made a public jab about atheists, as recapped April 2, 2014, by the National Journal. Mentioning an Air Force chaplain ordered by his supervisor to take down a religious blog post he'd written, deeming it insensitive to atheists, Cruz said: "I sort of thought the job of a chaplain is to be insensitive to atheists." By telephone, Danielle Muscato of American Atheists, which says it’s a "nonprofit, nonpolitical, educational organization dedicated to the complete and absolute separation of state and church," told us she couldn’t confirm Cruz making the "my America" claim. Our ruling A Facebook post suggests Cruz said the day he declared for president, "There is no place for gays or atheists in my America. None. Our Constitution makes that clear." Cruz has been clear about his belief in God and opposition to legalizing gay marriages. However, there is no record of him saying the Constitution leaves no place for gays or atheists in "my America." Pants on Fire!

pomt-04128	U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss votes more with Democrats than with conservatives.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/08/amy-kremer/chambliss-not-true-conservative-critic-says/	Is U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss actually down with the Democrats? A Georgia-based tea party leader made the assertion about the veteran Republican lawmaker during a recent segment on CNN. Amy Kremer, chair of the Tea Party Express, was angry with Chambliss for voting for a bill to avert the so-called "fiscal cliff." Many conservatives have complained the deal does little to slow spending, but raises income taxes on the wealthiest Americans. "I live in the state of Georgia and Saxby Chambliss is going to be primaried, our own senator. It's unacceptable to have somebody that votes with the Democrats more than they do with the conservatives," Kremer said. "And he has proven time and time again, he's all about the spending, and we're a red state, we deserve a conservative senator." PolitiFact Georgia was curious about the claim that Chambliss "votes with the Democrats" more than conservatives. Is there any truth to that in this age of partisan Washington politics or were Kremer’s remarks an exaggeration? Chambliss was a charter member of a group of a bipartisan senators that has tried in recent years to come up with solutions to the federal government’s fiscal challenges. His work with the group has drawn the suspicious eye of budget hawks and conservatives, a shift from the days he was viewed as a hero of the right after defeating DeKalb County Democrat Max Cleland for the U.S. Senate seat that Chambliss has now held since 2003. There’s been talk of Chambliss facing a Republican primary challenger when he’s up for re-election in 2014. Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint suspects that critics are using such vitriol in hopes of lining up opposition to Chambliss in 2014. "Somebody saying that is someone who wants a very conservative or right-wing alternative," Swint told us. So what about the accuracy of Kremer’s claim? We couldn’t find any statistics that specifically show whether Chambliss has voted more frequently with Democrats than conservatives. There is some research that has examined how often he’s voted with Republicans. What we found shows Chambliss hasn’t strayed too far from Republicans on most issues. Chambliss voted with fellow Republicans 91 percent of the time in 2011 and 2012, according to a Washington Post analysis. Only two Republican senators, John Cornyn of Texas and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, exceeded that percentage. And that was barely higher, at 92 percent. Chambliss voted with Republicans 95 percent of the time in 2009 and 2010, the Post reported. Another website, Open Congress, says Chambliss votes with his party 92 percent of the time. Again, Cornyn and McConnell were the only Republicans currently serving in the U.S. Senate who voted with their party with greater frequency (93 percent) than Chambliss. The Tea Party Express sent us a statement from Kremer that explained she was referring to key votes Chambliss has taken in recent years that she said "have separated him from the true fiscal conservatives." "In addition to the fiscal cliff legislation that has just passed, Chambliss has repeatedly voted for big government solutions favored by Democrats … Chambliss has been on the wrong side of every one of these votes," Kremer wrote. Kremer also complained in her statement that Chambliss added pork to bills in 2009 and 2010 and supported T-SPLOST, a proposed 1 percent sales tax increase to fund transportation projects in Georgia. Voters in most parts of the state overwhelmingly rejected the tax. Some of the legislation Kremer cited that Chambliss voted in favor of, such as the 2008 Wall Street bailout, a 2008 stimulus package and Medicare Part D, were supported by then-President George W. Bush, a Republican. Some of those bills had more support from Democrats. As for T-SPLOST, Chambliss said he was going to vote for it in the referendum because he thought it would create jobs in his hometown, Moultrie, and the surrounding area. Chambliss said his vote was not an endorsement and urged voters statewide to make up their own minds about T-SPLOST. Chambliss has voted with Republicans against Democrats on prominent bills such as Obama administration appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court, the federal health care law, the DREAM Act for illegal immigrants, extending the Bush administration tax cuts and an audit of the Federal Reserve. The American Conservative Union has conducted annual ratings of Congress since 1971, measuring how aligned the lawmaker is to the organization’s stance on legislation it says was important. In 2011, the most recent year available, Chambliss received a score of 80 on a scale of 100. That was lower than 27 Republican senators and tied him with three others. Chambliss’ lifetime average is 92.5, which is higher than most Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Chambliss said via email that some of Kremer’s claims were inaccurate. The senator defended some of his past votes, arguing he was "voting with my Republican president and a majority of the Republican caucus." "The tea party and I agree on the cause of America’s fiscal problems, and that much more needs to be done to address our country’s overspending," Chambliss said. To sum up, Kremer said Chambliss votes with Democrats more than conservatives. Her point was that the senator doesn’t vote along with fiscal conservatives on key issues. There are votes by Chambliss that differed from some senators considered conservative. Chambliss, though, has voted along with conservatives on some big issues as well. His voting record shows the senator votes with his GOP colleagues more than 90 percent of the time and his lifetime average with the ACU is better than most Republicans currently serving in the Senate.

pomt-01497	Says Scott Walker cut "taxes for the wealthiest" and raised taxes "on 140,000 Wisconsin families."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/25/mary-burke/scott-walker-cut-taxes-rich-raised-them-families-m/	In a TV ad released Sept. 11, 2014, Democrat Mary Burke looked into the camera and showed a bit of a whimsical side. "You know who had a really good idea about taxes?" she asked. "Ronald Reagan. Surprised you, didn't I?" Burke praised the late Republican president’s 1986 expansion of the federal Earned Income Tax Credit. It reduces the income taxes owed by low- and moderate-income workers, or enables them to collect a tax refund. Burke then pivoted to GOP Gov. Scott Walker. "You know who had a really bad idea? Governor Walker," she said. "He did just the opposite, cutting taxes for the wealthiest and raising them on 140,000 Wisconsin families." Is that Walker’s record on taxes? Tax cuts ‘for the wealthiest" Let’s start with "cutting taxes for the wealthiest," the first part of Burke’s claim. Has Walker helped richer folks? Sure. His first state budget, for 2011-’13, plus other measures adopted in 2011, provided tax cuts to corporations, businesses, manufacturers and investors, among other groups. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the nonpartisan scorekeeper on state budget matters, estimated their value at $2.33 billion over 10 years. The largest tax cut, done through tax credits for production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses, helps not only corporations but also individual owners of smaller businesses. Indeed, we rated Mostly True a claim that the credits would enable a factory owner -- in some scenarios -- to pay less in state income tax on those production earnings than a minimum-wage fast-food worker. But Walker has also cut income taxes across every income bracket. His second budget, for 2013-’15, lowered rates (while reducing the number of tax brackets from five to four) And later, in 2014, Walker signed legislation that dropped the lowest rate again (from 4.4 percent to 4 percent). Here are examples are for married couples filing jointly. Taxable income Tax rate/Previous law Tax rate/Current law Up to $14,540 4.6% 4% $14,540 to $29,090 6.15% 5.84% $29,090 to $215,000 6.5% 6.27% $215,000 to $320,250 6.75% 6.27% $320,250 and over 7.75% 7.65% *Taxable income levels shown are current. The income levels were slightly lower under the previous law. For example, the first tax bracket was up to $14,000 income, rather than $14,540. A few points on the table: The lowest bracket applies to all taxpayers. In other words, all tax filers are subject to the 4 percent tax rate on their first $14,500 of income, then the rates go up as taxable income reaches higher levels. Reduced tax rates don’t help if your income is so low that you don’t owe any income tax. In that vein, some groups advocate for expanding the state Earned Income Tax Credit, which can result in more taxpayers receiving income tax refunds after their returns are filed. Burke’s campaign pointed out that couples earning $29,090 got a tax rate reduction from 6.15 percent to 5.84 percent, but couples earning up to $320,250 got a larger reduction, from 6.75 percent to 6.27 percent. In addition, the income tax changes enacted under Walker include other breaks for people across many income levels, including those with health savings accounts and those who send their children to private schools. So, Walker cut taxes for the wealthy, but for a broad cross-section of taxpayers, as well. Tax increases Now to the other part of Burke’s claim -- that Walker raised taxes on 140,000 families. Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, contained what the Legislative Fiscal Bureau classified as $49 million in tax increases. The largest change was a reduction in the state Earned Income Tax Credit which, as we’ve noted, reduces the amount of income taxes a person owes or enables the person to get a tax refund. The fiscal bureau calculated that about 140,000 recipients would see their credits reduced. In other words, they would pay more in taxes or get a smaller tax refund. Here’s how the maximum credits were reduced for families with two or more children: Family size Maximum EITC/Previous Law Maximum EITC/Current Law One child $124 $124 Two children $716 $562 Three or more children $2,473 $1,955 So, 140,000 fewer lower-income people received the state Earned Income Tax Credit. About three-fourths of the money in the state Earned Income Tax Credit program pays for income tax refunds for those lower-income people, rather than reducing any state income tax they owe. Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst with the Wisconsin Budget Project, which is part of the liberal advocacy group Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, said most of the 140,000 who lost their credits would not save enough from the reduction in income tax rates to make up for that loss. In other words, they’d be paying more in income taxes or be getting a smaller refund. Dale Knapp, research director of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said he believes most of the 140,000 would benefit to some extent from the tax rate cuts, but that he didn’t know whether that savings would offset the lost tax credit. Our rating Burke said Walker cut "taxes for the wealthiest" and raised taxes "on 140,000 Wisconsin families." Walker cut taxes for wealthier residents and raised taxes for people on the lower end of the scale. But he also made tax cuts that applied across the board.

"Breaking: Michelle Wolf fired -- Comedy Central apologizes to Sarah Sanders," stated a May 2 headline by The Liberty Raise. The story was copied from The Daily World Update, a website that identifies itself as satire. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Wolf defended her own speech after criticism from the Trump administration and some journalists. But she was not fired. The hoax story used an alleged quote by a man identified as the CEO of Comedy Central, Art Tubolls. Don’t be fooled; this name has been used in other fake news stories. The president of Comedy Central is Kent Alterman. Comedy Central spokesman Steve Albani told PolitiFact that Wolf departed The Daily Show with Trevor Noah at the end of 2017. Then she landed her own show on Netflix. The Break by Michelle Wolf on Netflix is scheduled to debut on May 27.

pomt-05599	Says Gloria Steinem once called Kay Bailey Hutchison a "female impersonator."	true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/29/michelle-malkin/gloria-steinem-once-called-kay-bailey-hutchison-fe/	As right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh took flak for terming law student Sandra Fluke a "slut" over her claim that contraceptives can cost $3,000 a year, another pundit argued that conservative women are frequently targets of liberal vitriol. Syndicated writer and Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin listed such epithets in her March 7, 2012 column, including a Texas example: "It was feminist godmother Gloria Steinem who called Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison a ‘female impersonator.’ " Did women’s rights icon Steinem really belittle the femininity of Texas’ first female U.S. senator? Yes. The comment made national news in 1993 as Hutchison, then state treasurer, ran for U.S. Senate in a special election runoff against interim Democratic appointee Bob Krueger. Hutchison won the seat and has held it ever since; she is expected to retire from Congress in January 2013. USA Today, Time and NPR all ran 1993 news stories or opinion pieces describing gender-based attacks on Hutchison that included the "female impersonator" comment from Steinem. A June 25, 1993, opinion column in the Orange County Register gives this fuller version of the quotation: "a female impersonator … someone who looks like us but thinks like them." The longer quotation helped us pin down a probable date for Steinem’s remark, and Dallas Morning News senior political writer Wayne Slater searched his paper’s archives and sent us a May 23, 1993, news story that reads, in part: "Ms. Steinem, the founder of Ms. magazine, attacked Ms. Hutchison's stands on abortion and family-leave policies during a visit Friday in Dallas on behalf of Mr. Krueger. Ms. Steinem called Ms. Hutchison ‘a female impersonator.' " A May 22, 1993, Austin American-Statesman news story gives context for the "impersonator" remark: "Steinem said she was endorsing Krueger because of his support for abortion rights. She said Hutchison ‘has vacillated between a pro-choice and an anti-choice position for the last three years, after having been solidly anti-choice for 20 years.’ "Hutchison has said she favors abortion rights but would allow states to impose some restrictions, such as requiring minors to get parental consent." National news outlets picked up on the irony of a feminist saying that a female politician’s views disqualified her from being a real woman. Time magazine used the quotation to start its June 14, 1993, story on Hutchison’s win: "Gloria Steinem flew to Texas all the way from New York City to call Senate candidate Kay Bailey Hutchison a ‘female impersonator.’ Actress Annie Potts of ‘Designing Women’ pooh-poohed the Republican's vague stance on abortion rights, saying, ‘She's just the same old thing in a skirt.’ Columnist Molly Ivins hung the epithet ‘Breck girl’ on her, comparing the way the candidate tossed her blond hair to the slow-motion antics of models in the shampoo commercial. But Hutchison, the Texas state treasurer, survived those and many other attacks." For decades, Steinem has used the term "female impersonator" to describe women, including herself, who she said stopped being authentically female as they fit themselves into patriarchal society. She reportedly quipped in 1973, about men dressing as women, "I don’t mind drag -- women have been female impersonators for years." In a December 10, 1989, Los Angeles Times feature story, she said, "I was trained to be a female impersonator, to giggle and laugh, and to say, 'How clever of you to know what time it is.' " In her 1992 book, "Revolution From Within," she used the term to describe pre-teen girls forced into false role-playing as they move into adolescence. Malkin cited Steinem’s use of the term against Hutchison to rebut claims that attacks on conservative women come from extremists or entertainers rather than mainstream liberals. Malkin also pointed to comments from a National Organization for Women leader, MSNBC TV hosts and an Al Gore political consultant, among others. Our ruling Steinem referred to Hutchison as a female impersonator. Malkin’s statement rates True.

pomt-08929	In New Mexico, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Diane Denish "spent federal stimulus funds on campaign Christmas cards."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/26/susana-martinez/new-mexico-gubernatorial-race-susana-martinez-accu/	With New Mexico's two-term Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson leaving office later this year, a lively contest to succeed him has broken out between Democratic Lt. Gov. Diane Denish and Republican challenger Susana Martinez. In a recent ad, Martinez charged, "As jobs were lost, Richardson-Denish wasted millions. ... Denish even spent federal stimulus funds on campaign Christmas cards." We wondered whether the charge was accurate, and how serious a breach it would be. The expenditures came to light on Nov. 4, 2009, when the New Mexico Watchdog -- a blog sponsored by the libertarian Rio Grande Foundation -- published an investigation of expenditures from 2003 and 2004, when Denish was lieutenant governor. The blog alleged, and documents from Denish confirm, that Denish used some federal stimulus funds to pay a contract employee. It's worth noting that the stimulus funds in question were not from the bill signed by President Barack Obama in February 2009 but rather from a 2003 bill signed by President George W. Bush. Here's what the Watchdog wrote: "Lt. Governor Diane Denish used $225,000 in federal funds to pay for a driver to shuttle her to meetings and press events, a contractor to take Christmas pictures and write Christmas cards, a lawyer to make hotel reservations, opinion polling, and public relations services. The money was given to her for 'various projects' by Governor Bill Richardson. The money came from unallocated federal fiscal stimulus funds transferred to the New Mexico treasury under the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act." Of these expenditures, the most widely noted became the Christmas cards, and we'll focus on that alone, since that's what the ad talks about. (A detailed discussion of the controversy by journalist Heath Haussamen in the New Mexico Independent, including links to original documents, can be found here.) The Watchdog blog post said that Lauran Cowdrey, one of the contractors who had been paid using the excess federal funds, had filed an invoice, which was eventually paid, for "6 hours at $23.50 per hour on November 22, 2004, detailed in her time sheet as 'taking Christmas pictures, removing decorations, setting up pre-K interviews, organizing speeches and releases for website. On November 24, 2004, Cowdrey billed 8 hours described as 'work on Christmas card, work on history book request.'" With jockeying for the 2010 gubernatorial election already well under way, several GOP hopefuls, including Martinez, jumped on the allegations. Denish's office immediately responded by providing a bill and canceled check for the Christmas cards, which totaled $3,666.90. The check, dated Dec. 28, 2004, was written on a campaign account rather than using federal funds routed through the state government. So that clears the actual purchase of the cards from any potential federal violation. But that doesn't account for the money paid to Cowdrey to handle the Christmas card project. Because many public officials are allowed to use taxpayer funds for items such as Christmas cards, we asked the Denish campaign whether these particular cards were considered official business or a campaign project. They said that it was considered a campaign project. Because of that, it was improper to bill the state for it, ethics experts told PolitiFact. Instead, the campaign should have paid for Cowdrey's efforts or else she could have volunteered her time. But how big a deal was it that the taxpayers paid for Cowdrey's time working on the project? Our sources agreed: Not big at all. We estimate that the misallocated fedral funds would have been, at most, $141, or six hours times her $23.50 per hour pay rate. We asked government ethics experts what they thought of such a violation. "As a practical matter, because the use of the employee's time was essentially incidental, no enforcement authority is likely to get interested this," said Kenneth A. Gross, a former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission who is now an attorney with the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. "If there is a way to reimburse the government, it may be prudent to do so as a political matter." Holman, of Public Citizen, called the violation "so minor that I would not expect significant penalties, if any. It sounds like a small, careless action. A warning would probably be sufficient." We should remind readers that there were many allegations in the original Watchdog report that came with bigger pricetags, but we aren't ruling on them in this item. Haussamen noted one case in which Denish decided to reimburse her state office after he published evidence that some of the stimulus funds had been spent on putting out political news releases. All told, we think the documentation makes clear that Denish spent federal stimulus funds to prepare Christmas cards, and the canceled campaign check justifies the ad calling them "campaign Christmas cards." Even so, our experts agreed that these actions would have produced a monetary loss so small that they would be unlikely to trigger anything beyond a warning and a request for repayment, if that. So we rate the ad Half True.	None	Susana Martinez	None	None	None	2010-07-26T14:58:49	2010-07-22	['New_Mexico', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-06423	Herman Cain is a "pro-choice candidate."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/24/iowans-some-semblance-christian-decency/herman-cain-decidedly-anti-abortion/	Republican presidential contender Herman Cain is "pro-choice"? That’s the thrust of a flier that appeared on car windshields outside the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition’s fall banquet in Des Moines on Oct. 22, 2011. It was put out by two groups, Iowans for Some Semblance of Christian Decency and Iowans For Truth and Honest Government, neither of which appears to have a website. The leaflet declared, "When it came time to stand and defend the most helpless citizens in our country, presidential candidate Herman Cain threw the babies under the bus." As evidence, sandwiched between a picture of the smiling candidate and another of an aborted fetus, the flier provided a quote from Cain saying, "It ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that mother has to make." Cain, former head of Godfather’s Pizza, is known to be an across-the-board conservative, so we decided to see what his position has been. The quote on the flier comes from an interview Cain did with CNN’s Piers Morgan on Oct. 19, 2011. Here’s a transcript of their exchange about abortion: Morgan: Abortion. What's your view of abortion? Cain: I believe that life begins at conception. And abortion under no circumstances. And here's why -- Morgan: No circumstances? Cain: No circumstances. Morgan: Because many of your fellow candidates -- some of them qualify that. Cain: They qualify but -- Morgan: Rape and incest. Cain: Rape and incest. Morgan: Are you honestly saying -- again, it's a tricky question, I know. Cain: Ask the tricky question. Morgan: But you've had children, grandchildren. If one of your female children, grandchildren was raped, you would honestly want her to bring up that baby as her own? Cain: You're mixing two things here, Piers? Morgan: Why? Cain: You're mixing -- Morgan: That's what it comes down to. Cain: No, it comes down to it's not the government's role or anybody else's role to make that decision. Secondly, if you look at the statistical incidents, you're not talking about that big a number. So what I'm saying is it ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that mother has to make. Not me as president, not some politician, not a bureaucrat. It gets down to that family. And whatever they decide, they decide. I shouldn't have to tell them what decision to make for such a sensitive issue. So first Cain said abortion is allowable under "no circumstances," but then he seemed to be arguing it wasn’t a decision for the government to make, which sounds pretty pro-abortion rights to us. The next day, Cain’s campaign issued a statement attempting to clarify the point. Cain said he "understood the thrust of the question to ask whether that I, as president, would simply 'order' people to not seek an abortion. "My answer was focused on the role of the president. The president has no constitutional authority to order any such action by anyone. That was the point I was trying to convey. As to my political policy view on abortion, I am 100% pro-life. End of story." He went on to specify that he would appoint anti-abortion judges and oppose any government funding of abortion, including defunding Planned Parenthood. "I will do everything that a president can do, consistent with his constitutional role, to advance the culture of life," the statement said. Even if his explanation was a little clumsy, and did little to quell the controversy that erupted over what he said to Morgan, Cain's political history supports his anti-abortion stance. In 2003 and 2004, when he was running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Georgia, news stories consistently portrayed him as anti-abortion. "An associate pastor of Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta, Cain opposes abortion unless it is to save the life of the mother," the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote on Aug. 10, 2003. In May 2004, the paper ran a story about his radio ads attacking his primary opponents, one of whom was accused of flip-flopping on the issue. "He had the opportunity to protect innocent life and he didn't. He has been touting that he is pro-life, yet he votes for pro-choice legislation. If he is pro-life, he needs to vote pro-life," the Cain ad stated, according to the AJC. Later, in 2007, when Cain was working in talk radio, the L.A. Times wrote a story about abortion opponents reaching out to African-American voters. The story said "a political action committee run by black radio talk show host Herman Cain poured $1 million into edgy ads on urban radio. One spot contended that Democratic support for abortion laws is "decimating our people." It concluded: "Democrats say they want our vote. Why don't they want our lives?" Throughout this year’s presidential campaign Cain has said he’s opposed to the procedure, although he prompted controversy once before when he refused to sign a pledge from a conservative group to promise to end all abortion funding. A June 21, 2011, Boston Globe story said he refused to sign it "because of concern about separation of executive and congressional powers." We checked with a couple of outside groups -- one on each side of the abortion issue -- to see how they sized up Cain’s record. The National Right to Life Committee posted this chart indicating Cain has promised to end taxpayer funding of abortions and is opposed to Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. And NARAL Pro-Choice America cites four examples on its website that portray Cain opposing abortion rights. "Herman Cain is anti-choice. Any claim to the contrary is wrong," NARAL communications director Ted Miller said in an e-mail. Our ruling The flier in Iowa called Cain a "pro-choice candidate" who "threw the babies under the bus" by making a statement about abortion being a personal choice. He explained himself by saying he was answering a question about presidential powers, not how he feels about the morality or legality of abortion. On that, Cain has been consistent for years -- consistently anti-abortion. We rate the claim on the flier False.

pomt-03603	U.S. Rep. John Barrow of Georgia has helped support the implementation of "Obamacare."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/may/10/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-attacks-barrow-obamacare-votes/	Call it a pre-emptive strike, guilt by association or just good ol’ fashioned partisan politics. The National Republican Senatorial Committee sent out a news release shortly after the April 29 debate between the candidates running for a vacant congressional seat in South Carolina. Former Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican, won the seat Tuesday. The committee claimed in its release that Sanford’s opponent, Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch, was attempting to distance herself from the federal health care law, commonly called "Obamacare." Here’s the paragraph that drew our interest because of its Georgia connection: "ObamaCare has gone from being an ‘abstract’ discussion to a real life pain for families and businesses which has Democrats who supported this costly agenda like Bruce Braley, Mark Pryor, Mark Begich, Kay Hagan, Mary Landrieu, Jeanne Shaheen, John Barrow, Mark Udall, Gary Peters, Al Franken, Mark Warner, Tom Udall, Dick Durbin and Jeff Merkley in a tailspin," it stated. Barrow, from Augusta, is in his fifth term in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans have tried hard in recent years to unseat Barrow, who has fashioned himself as a moderate. We wondered about the accuracy of this claim because Barrow voted in 2010 against the creation of the health care law. "I am strongly in favor of reforming the health care system, but I don’t think this bill is going to do it, and therefore I can’t support it," Barrow said before the vote. "It puts too much of the burden of paying for it on working folks who are already being overcharged, and that’s not fair. It threatens to overwhelm Medicaid in Georgia, and that's not right. And it barely touches the insurance companies, and that's not smart. We can do better and I’m ready to start." NRSC spokeswoman Brook Hougesen said the claim is accurate, citing two votes Barrow cast against repealing the entire health care law. Those votes came in January 2011 and last July. The repeal measure passed in the Republican-controlled House, but repeal efforts consistently failed in the U.S. Senate, where Democrats held a slim majority. "He voted against ObamaCare before voting twice to keep the costly health care overhaul in place," Hougesen said via email. Hougesen concluded by saying: "Facts are a stubborn thing, and no matter how hard Barrow or Obama attempt to cast blame on Republicans for their disastrous law, it’s theirs to own." Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo said the NRSC’s accusations against his boss are "the same song and dance from these folks who don’t necessarily understand how the process works." Carbo said there are pieces of the health care law that Barrow wants to keep in place, such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying care because of pre-existing conditions. Barrow also supports the provision that allows children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26 years old. Carbo said Barrow wants to remove some of the most controversial pieces of the health care law, such as: The Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is designed to examine quality and access to care under the law, the effects of changes in payments to providers. The individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or face a tax penalty. An employer mandate that businesses with more than 50 full-time employees offer health care coverage to their employees or pay a penalty of $2,000 per worker above 30 employees. Bill Custer, the director of Georgia State University’s Center for Health Services Research, said the health care law is complicated and blanket statements about its impact on businesses and people "are wrong on either side." Custer said the law will help some small businesses that were previously unable to hire more workers because they can now offer health insurance or the worker can buy it through a health insurance exchange. Some larger businesses, he said, may be hurt by the law because of its potential penalties. "The overarching answer is adding and removing some provisions will help and hurt some individuals and businesses. It’s not an easy divide," said Custer, an associate professor who previously was an economist in a division of the American Medical Association and has written several papers on health insurance. Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the Washington-based America's Health Insurance Plans, sent us a chart showing information from five different organizations that concluded removing the individual mandate would result in millions of additional uninsured Americans and an increase in private health insurance premiums. "If you remove just the mandates and leave everything else in place, the cost of coverage would increase quite dramatically," he said. AHIP, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry, supports bipartisan legislation introduced in February that would remove the health insurance tax scheduled to take effect in 2014. Zirkelbach noted Barrow is one of the bill’s sponsors. "Unless this tax is repealed, next year an average family will pay over $300 in higher premiums, seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage will face $220 in reduced benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs, and state Medicaid managed care plans will incur an additional $80 in costs for each person covered," AHIP wrote after the bill was introduced. Zirkelbach sent us a chart showing the tax will result in an increase in premiums of between $5,539 and $6,777 for the average Georgia family over a 10-year stretch. So where does this leave us? The NRSC says Barrow’s unwillingness to vote for repealing the health care law is a "real life pain" for people and businesses because of its costs. An argument can be made that Barrow’s votes against repeal are tantamount to indirect support of its implementation. In other words, the NRSC says, Barrow owns it. Barrow, however, voted against the original Obamacare legislation and wants to repeal various parts of the law. The GOP cherry-picked a few votes to stretch a point here on a lawmaker it wants to defeat, Our rating: Mostly False.

pomt-07600	On the president unilaterally authorizing a military attack "that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation."	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/23/barack-obama/barack-obamas-libya-intervention-flip-flop-what-he/	In the wake of U.S. participation in military operations against targets in Libya, commentators on the left and the right have raised questions about whether President Barack Obama had the required authority to launch operations without specific authorization from Congress. A reader pointed out to us that Obama himself had made a notable comment during a 2007 interview with Charlie Savage, then a journalist with the Boston Globe. Savage asked Obama, "In what circumstances, if any, would the president have constitutional authority to bomb Iran without seeking a use-of-force authorization from Congress? (Specifically, what about the strategic bombing of suspected nuclear sites -- a situation that does not involve stopping an IMMINENT threat?)" While the specific context of Savage’s question concerned Iranian nuclear plants, we think Obama’s answer raised some points that are relevant for assessing the justification for the Libyan operation three years later. Obama said, "The president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation." He added, "As commander-in-chief, the president does have a duty to protect and defend the United States. In instances of self-defense, the president would be within his constitutional authority to act before advising Congress or seeking its consent. History has shown us time and again, however, that military action is most successful when it is authorized and supported by the legislative branch. It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action." We wondered whether Obama’s initiation of military operations in Libya represented a flip-flop on his stated principle that "the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation." First, some background on presidential and congressional war powers. The Constitution (Article I, Section 8) assigns the right to declare war to Congress. But the last time that actually happened was at the beginning of World War II. In subsequent wars, the president has generally initiated military activities using his constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief. Walter Dellinger -- former head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel and acting solicitor general under President Bill Clinton -- wrote recently that "presidential administrations of both political parties have recognized a long tradition that supports this use of force. And Congress has acknowledged its legitimacy as well." Specifically, Dellinger cited a pair of opinions by his office -- one from 1994 and one from 1995 -- that relied in large part on the War Powers Resolution, which was passed by Congress in 1973 and enacted over a veto by President Richard Nixon. The resolution grew out of concern by lawmakers and other critics that U.S. involvement in Vietnam had never received the necessary approval from Congress. "The resolution requires that, in the absence of a declaration of war, the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into such circumstances and must terminate the use of U.S. armed forces within 60 days unless Congress permits otherwise," Dellinger writes. By regulating the principle "that the president may introduce troops into hostilities or potential hostilities without prior authorization by the Congress," the War Powers Resolution effectively confirms that principle, Dellinger argues. The experts we asked generally agreed with this line of argument. In fact, some went so far as to say that the president’s powers to initiate military activities without specific congressional consent are by now so deeply ingrained that Obama’s 2007 comment to Savage was factually inaccurate. "The 2007 statement materially omitted key information -- I would charitably call it a ‘misrepresentation’ -- that would lead the average voter to believe that then-presidential candidate Obama was a champion of the Constitution’s restraints on executive power, as opposed to (George W. Bush) the cowboy," said Steven Groves, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. However, in this item, we’re not rating Obama’s 2007 comment on the Truth-O-Meter. Instead, we’re trying to judge whether Obama has changed his standards for initiating military action between then and now. That requires taking a look the president’s justification of military operations in Libya. In a March 21, 2011, letter to congressional leaders, Obama wrote that "as part of the multilateral response authorized under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, U.S. military forces, under the command of Commander, U.S. Africa Command, began a series of strikes against air defense systems and military airfields for the purposes of preparing a no-fly zone. These strikes will be limited in their nature, duration, and scope. Their purpose is to support an international coalition as it takes all necessary measures to enforce the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973. These limited U.S. actions will set the stage for further action by other coalition partners." Obama went on to say that the U.N. resolution authorized "all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya. … (Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's) continued attacks and threats against civilians and civilian populated areas are of grave concern to neighboring Arab nations and, as expressly stated in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, constitute a threat to the region and to international peace and security. His illegitimate use of force not only is causing the deaths of substantial numbers of civilians among his own people, but also is forcing many others to flee to neighboring countries, thereby destabilizing the peace and security of the region. Left unaddressed, the growing instability in Libya could ignite wider instability in the Middle East, with dangerous consequences to the national security interests of the United States." So, how well does this match up with Obama’s 2007 statement that "the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation"? We think the question boils down to whether the actions being taken in Libya "involve stopping an actual or imminent threat" to the United States. Anthony Clark Arend, a professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University, said he doesn’t perceive a strong argument that Libya represents "an actual or imminent threat to the nation." To him, that phrase suggests "a circumstance where the other state was engaging in or was about to engage in something tantamount to an armed attack against the United States (or, presumably, its allies). In the Libyan case, there is no such threat -- actual or imminent -- to the United States or its allies." Temple University law professor Peter J. Spiro said the administration could argue that the threat of a widespread humanitarian disaster in a sensitive region would be tantamount to "an imminent threat to the nation," thus justifying Obama’s actions under his 2007 principle. Indeed, that seems to be the argument Obama made when he said that "left unaddressed, the growing instability in Libya could ignite wider instability in the Middle East, with dangerous consequences to the national security interests of the United States." Most of our experts, however, saw that as a stretch. Kal Raustiala, a University of California at Los Angeles law professor, said that, "on the merits, he is right now and was wrong then." Legal commentator Stuart Taylor Jr. said he sees "no plausible loophole. He may possibly be right now ... but if so, he was wrong then." Raustiala points out that Savage specifically referenced Iran’s nuclear program in his question to Obama. But we think that Obama’s answer was sufficiently broad that it would be incorrect to assume that he was only talking about the scenario of attacking Iran over its pursuit of nuclear weapons. So where does this leave us? In 2007, Obama was adamant that the president did not have the power to authorize an attack if there was no imminent threat to the U.S. But now he has authorized just such an action. Full Flop.

pomt-00036	"Nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked Claire one of the most independent senators — right in the middle."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2018/nov/05/claire-mccaskill/sen-claire-mccaskill-one-americas-most-independent/	Trying to maintain her Senate seat in a historically red state, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has touted her voting record and bipartisan work as examples of her independence in one of her campaign ads. "Nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked Claire one of the most independent senators — right in the middle," her campaign said in a TV ad. Her Republican challenger, Attorney General Josh Hawley, is critical of her for often voting along party lines. Does McCaskill follow party precedent, or does she often stray from the left side of the aisle when making her decisions? Report cards, records, and rankings McCaskill’s ad cited Congressional Quarterly, her GovTrack Analysis records and National Journal ideology rankings to back up the claimed independent streak. Here’s what they said: • Congressional Quarterly: The publication’s analysis showed McCaskill was one of the least likely to vote in line with her own party, doing so 82 percent of the time in 2017. Only three senators, Angus King (81 percent), Joe Donnelly (74 percent) and Joe Manchin (64 percent), broke from their party during votes more often than McCaskill. • GovTrack: GovTrack is a small, four-member organization that regularly publishes the status of federal legislation and information about representatives and senators in Congress. On the site’s analytics page for McCaskill, the first metric displayed is her ideology chart. She is one of approximately 10 senators that rests ideologically close to the middle. GovTrack’s report card for her 2017 legislative year ranked her the sixth most conservative Senate Democrat. She joined bipartisan bills the seventh most often of all senators. • National Journal: Since 2007, her first year in office, McCaskill was ranked by National Journal as the 43rd, 52nd, 53rd, 48th, 51st, 57th and 50th most conservative member of the Senate, respectively, of the 100 members. National Journal stopped creating its ideology rankings in 2013, according to McCaskill’s team. Independent vs. moderate We reached out to six political science experts to shed some light on what factors might qualify a senator as independent. All but one of our experts noted that the wording of the claim is odd. As Cato Institute research fellow and editor Jason Kuznicki noted, "‘Moderate’ and ‘independent’ are not synonyms." Only two senators are currently registered as independent — Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Angus King (I-Me.). University of Missouri professor of American politics Marvin Overby said the claim was an exaggeration. "We live in an epoch where politics is very partisan and independent politicians are extraordinarily rare," he said. "But, comparatively speaking, it is fair to say that — in a hyper-partisan age — McCaskill shows more independence than most." Our ruling McCaskill said "nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked (her) one of the most independent senators — right in the middle." It’s difficult if not impossible to define independence. Multiple studies show McCaskill voted against her party more so than mostother Democrats. However, experts cautioned that a moderate or centrist voting record does not necessarily equate to being independent. For those reasons we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07929	"Six institutions in our country now control two thirds of the capital."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/28/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-critical-power-hands-few-banks/	Whether she’s blasting Wall Street greed in Michael Moore’s 2009 movie "Capitalism, a Love Story," or urging homeowners who face foreclosure to squat in their own homes, Rep. Marcy Kaptur has emerged as one of Congress’ most vocal critics of large financial institutions. The Toledo Democrat repeated many of her criticisms in an interview on MSNBC’S Dylan Ratigan show, where she criticized the nation’s biggest banks for "reckless" conduct that led to the nation’s foreclosure crisis. "Six institutions in our country now control two thirds of the capital," Kaptur said, who contends financial power should be returned to community banks and credit unions with ties to the areas where they do business. "That’s too much. It’s too much power in too few hands." The statistic Kaptur cited sounded like a big chunk of change for a few institutions to control, so we asked where her numbers came from. Her office cited a book called "13 Bankers" by MIT economist Simon Johnson and James Kwak which contains a table that examines the growth of the nation’s six biggest banks: Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. According to the chart, the assets of those banks grew from less than 20 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product in 1995, to roughly 60 percent today. The book argues that these "too big to fail" institutions harm the economy because they stifle competition and take excessive risks because they know the government will bail them out of a disaster. Federal Reserve data backs up Johnson’s contention that the six large banks control assets that are roughly 60 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. The statistic that inspired Kaptur’s remarks checks out, but there’s a problem with her statement. The chart refers to bank assets, not bank capital, as Kaptur said. And there’s a big difference between the two. Assets encompass everything a bank owns, including buildings and loans to customers. Capital is what’s left on a bank’s balance sheet after its liabilities – like customer deposits that can be withdrawn at any time – are subtracted from assets. The federal reserve considers banks to be adequately capitalized if their capital is more than eight percent of its assets, says Emre Ergungor, a senior research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Johnson said Kaptur’s underlying point about the concentration of power in the hands of a few banks was correct. "My overall assessment - Rep. Kaptur should have said ‘six institutions in our country now have assets worth over 60 percent of GDP’ (or less technical words to that effect)," Johnson said in an e-mail. "But she is right that (a) the size of assets controlled by our largest institutions has gone up a lot in recent years, including after the financial crisis, and (b) this is an economic problem of first order importance for the United States -- this is the point of 13 Bankers." We agree with Johnson. And had Kaptur said something like that, she would have rated higher on the Truth-O-Meter. A basic tenet PolitiFact uses to evaluate statements is that words matter. In this case, by using the word "capital," rather than "assets," she turned the accuracy of her statement upside down. That’s why we rate her statement as False.

pomt-05437	Under a new law, doctors performing drug-induced abortions could be charged if women don’t return to them for follow-up care	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/27/wisconsin-medical-society/wisconsin-medical-society-president-says-doctors-c/	The debate over a Republican-sponsored measure that requires new medical protocols in abortions has spawned confusion -- and its own debate -- over liability for doctors. The law, signed by Gov. Scott Walker in April, added penalties if physicians perform medication-induced abortions without an in-person exam before the procedure -- a move aimed at blocking the potential use of so-called "webcam abortions" in Wisconsin. Medication-induced abortions are limited to the first nine weeks of pregnancy. The law also required that doctors tell patients they "must return" for a post-abortion follow-up appointment at the same facility within 12 to 18 days instead of, for example, seeing their primary care doctor where they live. Critics, such as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, say this places an undue burden on women, especially in rural areas. Indeed, in the wake of the law, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said April 20, 2012 it would stop providing medication-induced abortions, citing legal uncertainty for doctors. The bill’s passage also drew a strong reaction from the Wisconsin Medical Society, which said the law intruded on the patient-doctor relationship. In an April 19 interview with the Wisconsin State Journal, the society’s new physician-president, Tosha Wetterneck of Madison, spoke about the mandate that women return to the same facility for follow-up care. The story paraphrased Wetterneck’s remark this way: "If she refuses, or prefers to see her personal physician, the patient would face no penalty but the doctor could be charged, Wetterneck said." The remark prompting a reproductive rights group, RH Reality Check, to say that doctors could face a Class I felony and up to 42 months in jail if the patient does not return for the recommended visit. Its Web posting cited Wetterneck’s comment. Meanwhile, state Sen. Mary Lazich, R-New Berlin, author of the original bill, denounced critics’ descriptions of it as "grossly misstated," and the claim about criminal charges when patients no-show as "patently false." So, who’s right? Can doctors be charged if a patient fails to do something? While debate rages on about the broad impact of the law -- critics say it limits access to the procedure, proponents say it protects women from substandard care -- we found wide agreement on this narrow question. The consensus: Doctors could face a fine of up to $10,000 if they don’t advise women to return in 12 to 18 days -- but not criminal liability. And the forfeiture only applies if the doctor fails to inform -- it’s not dependent on what a patient does later. We heard that from Lazich and Wisconsin Right to Life, but also the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Council, a state government agency that analyzed the bill -- and even the Medical Society itself. They all said that even though the bill says patients have to be told they "must return," there is no accountability built into the law for either the woman or the physician if the woman does not come back. So why was Wetterneck of the Medical Society quoted as saying doctors could be charged? Medical Society lobbyist Mark Grapentine told us Wetterneck is not a lawyer and likely thought "charged" was an appropriate description even for forfeitures. He said she and the Medical Society understood the lack of criminal penalties for the no-return scenario, while strongly objecting to felony liability for other aspects of drug abortion protocols. We think the term "charged" would be heard by most listeners as a reference to criminal liability -- as evidenced by the reaction from RH Reality Check. Perhaps confusion on the issue was inevitable. The law does create a criminal felony penalty for failing to follow certain procedures related to a medication-induced abortion. Just not the protocol on the post-abortion follow-up. Specifically, Act 217 requires that the same doctor who prescribes the drugs do the pre-procedure exam and be physically present when the drug is given. Bill authors say those rules were aimed to block use of Web cameras to consult with women about the drugs, as is done in some states to make abortions more possible in rural areas. By law, at least 24 hours must pass between the patient’s voluntary consent and an abortion. The potential criminal penalty on that point, for the person who provides the drugs, is up to 42 months imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. Our conclusion The president of the Medical Society said a new abortion law means doctors could be charged if patients don’t return for a follow-up appointment after a drug-induced abortion. On that specific portion of the law, no criminal liability was inserted, and doctors’ duty is limited to orally informing the patient she must return. There is a new criminal penalty for failing to personally supervise such abortions, but Wetterneck clearly was referring to the follow-up care section of the bill. We rate her statement False.

pomt-05170	Decriminalizing marijuana "will save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/17/john-g-edwards/rep-john-edwards-says-decriminalizing-marijuana-wo/	On June 13, 2012, Governor Lincoln Chafee signed into law legislation that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of marijuana. As of April 1, 2013, having 1 ounce or less will be a civil offense, punishable by a $150 fine. Rep. John Edwards, D-Tiverton, was the bill’s prime sponsor as it moved through the Assembly for the third consecutive year. During a June 5 House debate, he told the story of how, as a construction manager, he employed two skilled carpenters in their 50s who were barred from working on federal projects because "they had a stupid arrest when they were young for simple possession" of marijuana. Most people don’t go to prison for having a small amount of marijuana, Edwards said, "but they do get arrested and the arrest never goes away." Not only would his bill curtail those arrests, said Edwards, "it will save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars and it will also allow our police to do what they do best and that’s catch criminals." We were curious where Edwards got his cost saving figures; $4 million to $11 million is a pretty wide window. Edwards told us he got his information from Wallace B. Gernt Jr. and Christopher Reilly, the president and vice president respectively of The Bradford Group, the Rhode Island public relations firm. One of its clients is the Marijuana Policy Project, a Washington, D.C., group trying to change marijuana laws around the country. The facts When we contacted Reilly, he acknowledged a certain haziness hovering over the figures: "There’s a lot of different thoughts of where those numbers come from." Ah, OK. Then he sent us two reports and had the Marijuana Policy Project forward a memo that a Harvard University economist sent Rhode Island lawmakers earlier this year. One report was from the Special Senate Commission to Study the Prohibition of Marijuana, issued in March 2010. It notes that in 2009, Rhode Island police made 2,546 arrests for marijuana possession, first offense. (It doesn’t say how much pot each suspect had.) But the report does not say how much money Rhode Island could save by decriminalizing marijuana. It defines the savings only as "significant". The second report was "The Criminal Justice Costs of Marijuana Prohibition in Rhode Island," issued in 2010 by the Rhode Island nonprofit group OpenDoors, which helps people released from prison. That report, supported by the Marijuana Policy Project, says Rhode Island stands to save a whopping $12.7 million a year by decriminalizing possession of an ounce or less of marijuana. We contacted the main author of that report, Nick Horton, who told us that most of the purported savings -- $11.2 million -- wasn’t calculated by OpenDoors at all. "That figure is not mine," said Horton. It turns out that number came from Jeffrey Miron, the Harvard economist, and his 2010 report that studied how much money the United States would save if it legalized all drugs. In his one-page memo to Rhode Island lawmakers this spring, Miron provided the general equation he used to reach his $11.2 million figure but never plugged in any actual numbers: "I guess when you are a Harvard professor, you no longer have to "show your work,’’ Robert Capecchi, a legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, wrote in an email when Politifact asked for the details. When we called Miron, he said his estimate -- which related exclusively to police enforcement savings -- came from a 2010 report he did for the libertarian Cato Institute: The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition. The study found that by legalizing all drugs, the United States could save $41.3 billion a year. The study includes a state by state analysis of drug arrests that Miron used. For instance, 2007 data from the FBI’s annual Uniform Crime Reports shows that in Rhode Island that year the police made 26,966 drug arrests. Of those, 1,922 were for marijuana possession. (Again, the data don’t say how much marijuana each suspect had.) By dividing 1,922 by 26,966, Miron determined that 7 percent of all arrests that year were for marijuana possession. He then used other data from state government and the U.S. census -- some coming from 2008 -- to conclude that the total police expenditure in Rhode Island was $287 million. Seven percent of that is $20.1 million. Then he estimated that half of the marijuana arrests were incidental to other more serious charges. Kicking those out, he calculated the annual police savings would be $10.5 million. That’s not the $11.2 million cited by OpenDoors, but Miron says the $700,000 difference is likely because the data he used was several years old. In a follow-up conversation, Edwards conceded that he never thought the savings would total the $11 million he cited on the House floor. "It’s more on the lower end of $4 million," he said. He based that, in part, on some of his own calculations of prison savings -- a point that Miron, the Harvard economist, said he was surprised to hear Edwards talking about because "almost no one is in prison for [minor] possession." But Edwards says he asked Corrections officials for a one-day snapshot of the prison population about a year or so ago. On that day, 42 people were being held for marijuana possession. He multiplied that by the average cost of holding one person at the ACI for a year ($44,000) and came up with a quick $1.8 million savings. Corrections Department officials told us Edwards’ methodology is wrong because those inmates are scattered among many different units, so their absence would not lead to any staff reductions. They did say there would be some savings by having those 42 beds empty -- about $154,602. That’s a long way from $1.8 million, let alone $4 million to $11 million. Our ruling State Rep. John Edwards was specific in his claim that decriminalizing marijuana will "save the state anywhere from $4 (million) to $11 million dollars." Edwards later backed away from the $11 million figure. Yet neither he nor any of the advocates he worked with to get the legislation passed could substantiate even the lesser amount. Therefore we rate his statement a smoldering False.

pomt-02716	To comply with non-discrimination laws, the government is "forcing people in business to make wedding cakes" for anyone.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/22/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-talks-duck-dynasty-wedding-vendors/	The airwaves are roaring with chatter about Phil Robertson of A&E’s popular show Duck Dynasty for comments he made about homosexuality in a GQ interview. With the future of the show in question, talking heads are either criticizing Robertson’s remarks as deeply offensive or, like radio host Glenn Beck, defending him on grounds of freedom of speech. If the country truly valued "equality and diversity," Beck argued, Robertson would be allowed to express his opinion without being punished for it. He urged Robertson’s family not to back down and said his network, TheBlaze, would welcome them into the fold because they want "diversity of thought." "If you think that it isn’t about anything but marriage and equality, you’re mistaken. It’s not about equality," Beck said. "If it’s about equality and it’s about diversity, then you would allow people a different opinion. A different opinion. No, no, no, we don’t have different opinions now. "You are forcing people in business to make wedding cakes," he said. "If they say I don't want to serve you, I don't want to make a wedding cake for you, you must make a wedding cake. There's no diversity in that. That's fascism." (this was all the same sequence) Beck’s wording is not explicit, but we think we know what he was referencing (his people did not get back to us). There have been a few recent legal battles involving wedding vendors who refuse to provide their services to same-sex couples on religious grounds. We wanted to investigate if people are forced to make wedding cakes against their will and what those cases mean more broadly. Colorado cake conundrum There are two high-profile cases of bakers citing Christian beliefs when they refused to provide wedding cakes for a gay couple who wanted to celebrate their marriage. We’ll focus on the one with a recent judge’s order. One summer day in 2012, a gay couple stopped inside Masterpiece Cakeshop in the Denver area seeking a wedding cake to celebrate their wedding in Massachusetts. The mom of one of the newlyweds joined the baker and the couple at a table to discuss their vision, though they never got a chance to bring it up. Once the owner learned what the wedding cake would be for, he told the would-be customers that preparing a cake for them would go against his Christian beliefs, according to court documents. He said, "I’ll make you birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies, I just don’t make cakes for same-sex weddings." The American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission on the couple’s behalf. A year and a half later on Dec. 6, 2013, administrative law judge Robert Spencer ruled in favor of the couple. Coloradans passed a constitutional ban on gay marriage but recently allowed civil unions. The civil union law allows religious groups and leaders to opt out of performing those ceremonies but does not include religious protections for business. More pertinent here, an administrative law judge noted, the state amended its public accommodation law to add "sexual orientation" as a protected class that cannot be discriminated against by businesses that are open to the public. Spencer said the cakeshop must "cease and desist from discriminating" against gay couples or face financial penalties for refusing to make wedding cakes for gay couples in the future. "At first blush, it may seem reasonable that a private business should be able to refuse service to anyone it chooses," he wrote. "This view, however, fails to take into account the cost to society and the hurt caused to persons who are denied service simply because of who they are." The judge rejected the cakeshop’s argument that providing a cake for the couple would have conveyed support for their marriage, pointing out that he refused to serve them before they could dive into the details of what the cake would look like. The couple "might have wanted a nondescript cake that would have been suitable for consumption at any wedding. ... The act of preparing a cake is simply not ‘speech’ warranting First Amendment protection," he wrote. If the cake shop defies the judge’s order, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission could seek court action that could include "issuance of contempt citation, potential fines and imprisonment for offending the dignity of the court," a spokeswoman said. A spokesman for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit that defended the baker in court and has taken up similar cases, said it would appeal the order but has not filed one (the 30-day window for an appeal closes in early January 2014). Other cases of religious liberty vs. public accommodation ADF spokesman Greg Scott said there are many more examples than just Masterpiece Cakeshop of "government intrusion on conscience, in which an arm of the state tells you comply with the government-decreed morality or face the consequences." Scott provided examples that go beyond wedding services, such as a Mennonite family that runs a manufacturing company and sued the Obama administration over its rules requiring employers to cover contraceptive care, including the morning-after pill. "There’s more, but I think you get the idea," he said. "It is becoming a nationwide problem." In Oregon, a state investigation into a bakery refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple remains open. Elsewhere, a Washington wedding florist was sued for refusing to provide floral arrangements for a gay couple’s wedding. The U.S. Supreme Court could decide on a discrimination complaint against a New Mexico-based wedding photographer who declined to photograph a lesbian couple’s commitment ceremony. The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled against the photographer, saying artistic services offered to the public are regulated by discrimination laws. Eugene Volokh, a UCLA School of Law professor who co-authored a brief in support of the photographer, said he does not think the Constitution permits the government to require photographers, painters or writers to "create constitutionally protected speech." (He said he does not think bakers have as strong a case because they are not as involved in the ceremony.) Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia professor of law and religious studies, said he would be surprised if the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the photographer’s case. So what does it mean? Laws that protect customers from being discriminated against because of sexual orientation do not exist for the whole country. The ruling by the Colorado administrative law judge was limited to Colorado, and the same goes for other cases in other states so far. "But really, I would say that the (Colorado) decision is just affirming a much broader, long-standing legal principle that religion doesn't give anyone a reason to discriminate," said Amanda Goad, an ACLU attorney involved in the Colorado baker’s case. Twenty-one states have public accommodation laws similar to the one in Colorado, including California, New York and Oregon, according to the Human Rights Campaign. That means clear protections do not exist in 29 states, such as Florida and Texas, though some cities have implemented their own ordinances, Goad said. The judicial decisions in New Mexico and Colorado show why those laws are important to supporters of gay rights, she said. "If there’s no public accommodation law that covers sexual orientation, then no one has any obligation, religious or not, to serve anybody," Laycock said. "The gay couples only have a claim if there is a law in place that gives them a claim." Just because it isn’t happening in every state does not mean it is not happening, Volokh argued. "You might say, well it is good that cake bakers are being required to prepare cakes for same-sex commitment ceremonies," he said. "But if the claim is that cake bakers are being required to do this, that claim seems to be correct. And it seems likely that if more anti-discrimination laws are enacted, this will happen in more and more states." Our ruling Incensed by A&E’s response to its opinionated Duck Dynasty star, Beck lamented the country’s lack of appreciation for "diversity of thought," saying Robertson is entitled to say what he wants in accordance with his freedoms of speech and religion. Even wedding cake-makers are feeling the same pressure. "If they say I don't want to serve you, I don't want to make a wedding cake for you, you must make a wedding cake," he said, just weeks after a Colorado administrative law judge said a Denver-area baker must "cease and desist" discriminating against gay couples who want wedding cakes or face fines. Indeed, that happened. Another investigation into a bakery that withheld a wedding cake is pending in Oregon. Beck did not get into details about either case on his show. But he should have clarified that many states do not have the same protections for sexual orientation in their public accommodation laws, so it’s less clear if businesses in those states could be compelled to make cake if they had personal objections. We rate this claim Mostly True. Correction: Douglas Laycock said the New Mexico case would be binding nationwide if it was taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court. An earlier version of this story was incorrect on this point.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2013-12-22T16:07:38	2013-12-19	['None']

"Thomas Paine wrote that ‘the duty of a patriot is to protect his country from his government,’" Perry said, drawing applause from the crowd during his Feb. 24 event at the Richmond Marriott. Paine, a prolific pamphleteer during the Revolutionary War, authored essays such as "Common Sense" and "The American Crisis" that took aim at British rule of the colonies. His words remain widely cited by conservatives to support their calls for limited government. We wondered whether Perry had quoted Paine correctly. We turned to the National Thomas Paine Historical Association in New Rochelle, N.Y., which posts Paine’s major writings. You can find plenty of patriotic passages there, some of them published while Gen. George Washington suffered battlefield losses in 1776. "These are the times that try men’s souls," Paine wrote. "The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country. But he that stands now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered." But many quotes have been mistakenly attributed to Paine, and the association also notes on its website what its hero did not write. Among them is a virtually identical phrase the former Texas governor attributed to Paine: "The duty of a patriot is to protect his country from its government." Gary Berton, secretary of the association, told us, "I’ve read every word of Paine’s several times. It’s definitely not Paine." Berton, who has studied Paine’s writings for decades, said the phrase doesn’t even sound like a thought the founding father would convey. Paine was certainly critical of Britiain’s rule of the colonies and hoped society would one day become so advanced that it wouldn’t need government, Berton said. "But in the meantime, he was for a strong central government with redistribution of wealth," added Berton, who is also the coordinator of the Institute of Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College in New Rochelle. Harvey Kaye, a history professor at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay who wrote a 2006 book about Paine, also told us the quote didn’t come from the pamphleteer. Many conservatives in recent decades have tried to turn Paine into an "anti-statist prophet," Kaye said in an email. "But Paine was a radical, small-d democratic patriot who opposed monarchical & aristocratic government and called for independence and the making of democratic republic (Common Sense, 1776), proposed a social security system (Rights of Man, 1792), and argued for taxing the propertied because God intended the earth for all to share and the concentration of power and wealth produced poverty for working people (see Agrarian Justice, 1797)," Kaye wrote. So where did Perry’s misattributed quote come from? Berton said it appears to have been penned by Edward Abbey, an American anarchist, environmentalist and novelist. Two weeks before Abbey died in 1989, he published "A Voice Crying in the Wilderness," a collection of sayings and quotes that came from a private journal he kept for 21 years. "A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government," Abbey wrote in his book. Berton said the attribution to Paine appears to have spread through the Internet. We can’t swear that Abbey coined the saying. In a humorous introduction to his book, Abbey noted that many of the collected sayings came from his earlier writings. "Others may be unconscious plagiarisms from the great and the dead (never steal from the living and mediocre), ideas absorbed in my reading so long ago that I’ve made them mine and forgotten the source," Abbey wrote. "If so, the author would appreciate hearing from readers on this point. (Be kind.)" Finally, we should note that we reached out to the Perry camp several times while researching this article and did not get a response. Our ruling Perry says Paine wrote that ‘the duty of a patriot is to protect his country from his government.’" He offers no proof or citation of where Paine wrote that phrase. Two Paine scholars tell us the quote didn’t originate with the founding father and that the saying doesn’t appear in any of Paine’s writings. We rate Perry’s claim False.

pomt-06958	"By any measure, New Jersey has one of the most segregated school systems in the country."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/17/david-sciarra/new-jersey-education-law-center-director-says-stat/	New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the country and certainly one of the most ethnically diverse. But the state’s school systems aren’t exactly a model of racial diversity, according to David Sciarra, executive director of the New Jersey Education Law Center, based in Newark. "By any measure, New Jersey has one of the most segregated school systems in the country," Sciarra said in a May 19 Bob Braun column in The Star-Ledger. Sciarra made the comment during an event days before the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered that $500 million be pumped into the state’s low-income schools, known as Abbott districts. New Jersey schools are segregated, Sciarra said, because the state has hundreds of school districts that track municipal boundaries. The cities typically have large concentrations of black and Latino students, while the suburbs are overwhelmingly white. Kentucky and other southern, or more rural states, are among the most integrated because those states have countywide or regional school districts that tend to draw a more diverse student population. Still, segregation is a strong claim to make in 2011 -- and one that might be in the eye of the beholder, since many consider it a forced separation of the races. Some education experts see things differently, however, and agree with Sciarra’s statement. Segregation isn’t just about about the forced separation of racial groups, according to Sciarra and to Gary Orfield, professor of Education, Law, Political Science and Urban Planning, and co-director of the Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles at the University of California, Los Angeles. To be clear, New Jersey’s Constitution prohibits racial segregation in public schools and strict constitutional law requires that schools have racial balance, Sciarra said. "In terms of racial minorities, African-Americans and Latinos, we have a very segregated system," Sciarra told us. "In the United States, we’re (New Jersey) usually third, fourth or fifth." For 2001-02, New Jersey ranked in the top 10 of states as being among the most segregated, according to the report "Brown At 50: King’s Dream or Plessy’s Nightmare?" The report was authored by Orfield and Chungmei Lee in January 2004, when The Civil Rights Project was based at Harvard University. The report shows that New Jersey ranked ninth highest in the nation for the percentage of blacks in majority white schools; fifth nationwide for the percentage of blacks attending mostly minority schools; and sixth overall for the number of white students enrolled in majority black schools. The state’s rank in each of those categories, but for Latino students, was slightly higher: seventh, fourth and fifth for the respective categories. Ranking that high on the report is indicative of more segregation, while states much lower on the list are indicative of having more integrated schools. For the 2009-10 school year, data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that 66 percent of either whites or blacks in New Jersey would have to move to another district in order to achieve racial balance in schools. That figure drops to 64 percent for racial balance between Latinos and whites, according to the statistics. The same statistics also show that the average black or Latino student in New Jersey attends a school that is 28 percent white. As a result of those figures, New Jersey ranks in the top 10 of most segregated states when looking at all U.S. states and the District of Columbia. John Logan, a professor of Sociology at Brown University and director of the US2010 Project, a research program on changes in American society in the recent past, looked at the racial divide for elementary school children in 2000, in major metropolitan areas. He found that in the Newark area, 72 percent of Hispanics or whites would have to move to another district to achieve racial balance in schools. For blacks, it was 82 percent. The figures were even higher for the Bergen-Passaic area. The Orfield and Lee study looked at a decade of resegregation after the Supreme Court’s 1991 decision in Dowell v. Oklahoma City, which allowed school districts to declare themselves unitary, end desegregation plans and return to neighborhood schools. As part of their study, Orfield and Lee examined enrollment in U.S. schools, patterns of segregation and desegregation of various groups, regions and community types. Among the study’s findings: a major increase in segregation in many districts where court-ordered desegregation was ended; rural and small town school districts, on average, are the most integrated schools in the nation for blacks and Latinos, but segregation is severe in smaller central cities and in the suburbs of large metropolises; poverty found in the most intensely segregated minority schools can be connected to unequaled educational opportunity. Some say a legacy of past housing decisions contribute to segregation. "For decades, U.S. and local housing policy encouraged segregation by race and class through decisions about where public housing would or would not be built and how it would be administered," said Ansley T. Erickson, an assistant professor of History and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. "Simultaneously, both mortgage finance policies and local real estate practices produced suburbs that were predominantly white. Thus society did not simply cluster itself. Individuals did make choices about where they would prefer to live or send their children to school, but they did so influenced by incentives, disincentives, and restrictions set out in policy and practice." Let’s review. Sciarra and several other experts say the state’s school system is among the most segregated in the nation, primarily because of a history of housing patterns and other demographic factors. Data from a 2004 report on segregation, as well as 2009-10 statistics from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that New Jersey is in the top 10 of states for having segregated schools. Sciarra said New Jersey typically ranks in the top five for being the most segregated, but our research puts New Jersey more in the top 10. For those reasons, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11145	It is a "myth" that "per-student funding only rose by 47 cents this year."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/may/30/florida-house-majority/did-florida-students-see-increase-47-cents-or-it-m/	Florida House Republicans are playing mythbusters on claims of stagnant school spending. The House Majority Office, which is overseen by Speaker Richard Corcoran, released a five-minute video May 17 that takes aim at teachers’ unions and state educators (and unnamed "media allies") who say the 2018-19 education budget isn’t enough to cover the costs of running a school district. Back in March, superintendents of some of Florida’s largest districts wrote a column saying, "The 47 cents per student increase in the base student allocation — the only funds school districts can use for student programs, teacher salaries and other costs — will force us to make cuts in critical areas of our operations." The House Republicans’ released their video on the same day 35 Democrats called on the Legislature to hold a special session to reconsider education funding for the next school year (a motion that failed). It offers a defense of education spending (using phrases like "sparsity supplement" and "millage compression") to argue that approved spending is really closer to $100 per student, at least. "Have you heard the ‘47 cents’ myth?" the Florida House asked in the description of the video. "The rumor goes ‘per-student funding only rose by $0.47 this year.’ Nothing could be further from the truth." The number isn’t a myth; it just isn’t the number that House Republicans want to highlight as inaccurate. House leaders and district officials are using two different ways to measure per-student funding, based on different funding sources. There’s some truth to both claims, but using either amount requires more context. Calling one a "myth" is too dismissive. What to know about the House Majority argument The House Majority Office argues that per-pupil spending increased by $101, not 47 cents. The $101 figure is accurate if you consider every facet of education funding. The state’s 2018-19 education budget increased public school spending by more than $485 million. In 2017-18, per-pupil funding was $7,307. In 2018-19, it increased slightly to $7,408 per student (an increase of $101.50). It’s worth noting that the $101 increase is an average of what school districts will receive, so the actual amount of per-pupil funding really depends on the county. For example, it’s possible that the largest districts won’t receive all of the $101 after taking into account new state mandates and an expected student decrease. According to the Florida Department of Education documents, total per-pupil funding will increase by $65 in Miami-Dade; $52 in Broward County; $73 in Pinellas County; and $85 in Hillsborough County. That said, other counties, particularly smaller ones like Calhoun County, will receive $263. More importantly, the $101 increase in student spending includes every source of education funding. Some sources of funding have to be used for specific purposes. To name a few, there’s the Exceptional Student Education allocation reserved for people who are disabled or gifted; the Teacher Classroom Supply Assistance Program, which allows teachers to purchase materials and supplies for the public school students assigned to them; and the digital classroom allocation, which provides money for devices. It also includes the money set aside to hire additional school resource officers and money to increase mental health facilities. So, while it’s accurate to say per-student funding rose by $101, it’s important to know that school districts don’t have a lot of flexibility in how that money can be used. That’s why state educators and unions have used the increase in the base student allocation (47 cents) to demonstrate how little money is left for districts to pay for day-to-day operating costs. Tracing the origins of 47 cents Labeling the 47-cent claim "a myth" is misleading. After all, it appears in the Florida Department of Education’s own 2018-19 document about education financing. This amount refers to the budget’s base student allocation, the amount of money allocated for each student. The money is unrestricted, which means districts have the most freedom in how that portion of the education budget is used. The base student allocation is one of the only pieces of the budget that goes toward teachers’ salaries and raises, electricity, fuel for buses, health care for faculty and administrators, and other operational costs. In 2017-18, the base student allocation was $4,203.95. In 2018-19, it increased slightly to $4,204.42 per student (an increase of 47 cents, if you haven’t caught on by now). The base student allocation fell during the recession from 2007 to 2012. Funding has increased each year starting in 2012-13, though those year-over-year hikes have been bigger than in this year’s budget. Fiscal year Base Student Allocation 2007-08 $4,079.74 2008-09 $3,886.14 2009-10 $3,630.62 2010-11 $3,623.76 2011-12 $3,479.22 2012-13 $3,582.98 (+$103) 2013-14 $3,752.30 (+$169.32) 2014-15 $4,031.77 (+279.47) 2015-16 $4,154.45 (+$122.68) 2016-17 $4,160.71 (+$6.26) 2017-18 $4,203.95 (+$43.24) 2018-19 $4,204.42 (+$0.47) The 47-cent increase wasn’t always the plan. In January, before the Parkland shooting, the House’s original education budget included increasing the base student allocation by $75. School districts receive more than just the base student allocation for education-related expenses. But the issue is that a good chunk of the overall funding is tied to specific purposes. For example, more than $161 billion of the $500 million increase is for the safe school allocation and can only be used on certain purposes such as paying for school resource officers. Another good chunk — $69 million — has to go toward mental health services. In both of those cases, the money is restricted and can only be used for its intended purpose. So, unlike the base student allocation, it can’t be used on teacher raises. "While money has been poured into special legislative projects such as best and brightest, safe schools and mental health, it is the core funding beginning with the base student allocation that enables districts to do the vast majority of the work they do with students throughout the year," said Tracey Pierce, the Duval schools chief of public relations and marketing. Our ruling The Florida House Majority Office said that it’s "a myth" that per-student funding only rose by 47 cents this year. The claim that per-student funding only rose by 47 cents definitely needs context. But calling it a myth goes too far, as does the Republicans’ claim that per-pupil spending is really closer to $100. Moreover, not every district will get that per-pupil amount. An amount that high is only possible once you factor in all education-related spending. That includes a good chunk of money that has to be spent on specific purposes like school security and mental health. The increase in the base student allocation (47 cents) represents the amount of money left over for flexible spending, which districts can use for student programs, teacher salaries and other operational costs. The office's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01923	An average of nine children a day in the U.S. die of gunshot wounds.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2014/jun/27/brady-campaign-prevent-gun-violence/do-average-nine-children-day-die-united-states-gun/	Editor’s Note: We rarely find it necessary to re-examine a PolitiFact Oregon fact-check, but this was an exception. Our original fact-check, based largely on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that a claim by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence was Mostly True. However, readers brought significant new information to light that we thought warranted a new analysis -- and ultimately a new ruling. We are committed to finding the facts even if they emerge after we’ve published. In the wake of the Reynolds High School shooting in Troutdale that left two students dead June 10, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation’s leading gun control advocacy groups, has once again been urging parents to lock up guns and ammunition in separate gun lockers. The claim: At a June 17, 2014, rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children’s shoes and a chalkboard that read: "9 kids every day will never have another birthday." Were Emilio Hoffman, the victim at Reynolds, and Jared Padgett, the shooter, just two of nine children who die from gun violence on any given day? PolitiFact Oregon wanted to find out. The analysis: In an email, Brady Campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Fuson said the number is based on a five-year average of government data recording children who died from gunshot wounds. The ages range from infants to 19. Using the same age range, we obtained the same numbers from an online database maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2007 to 2011, the most recent data available, 14,258 children died as a result of gunshot wounds. The circumstances range widely: accidental shootings by adults, kids who gained access to unsecured guns, gang violence, suicide and planned shootings like the incident at Reynolds High School on June 10, 2014. The numbers work out to 7.81 deaths a day, about one fewer than the Brady Campaign claimed. We presented this information to Heidi Yewman, a member of the national Brady Campaign board, who organized the rally. She acknowledged that the number presented at the rally was incorrect. A volunteer accidentally wrote the wrong number on the chalkboard display, she said. Nine children are unintentionally shot and survive every day, she said, but those children are in addition to the eight who are shot — intentionally and unintentionally — and die. "It’s really important we don’t exaggerate the number, because it undermines what we’re saying," Yewman said in a phone interview. "That was unfortunate and somewhat misleading." She added: "Certainly there was no conspiracy to mislead the public." The national Brady Campaign spokeswoman confirmed the figure. "It is correct to say that 8 children and teens die from gun violence every day," Fuson said in an email. "It is also correct to say that 9 children and teens are shot unintentionally." We checked the nonfatal number as well and found that 8.86 children are unintentionally shot each day and survive, according to the CDC’s nonfatal injuries database. But those two numbers — eight gun-related deaths and nine injuries per day — do not show the whole picture. PolitiFact Oregon obtained a breakdown by age from the CDC’s online database and found that about half of all youth gun deaths — 7,223 of 14,258 — are 18- and 19-year-olds. The same goes for unintentional injuries, roughly 46 percent of which — 7,479 of 16,172 — are 18- and 19-year-olds. Remove those two years from the calculation, and there are an average of 4.76 unintentional injuries each day and 3.85 deaths. That is significant given the use of the word "children" in the Brady Campaign’s display, along with a chalkboard and shoes suited to children younger than 12. In addition, people 18 and older are legally considered adults. They are allowed to buy guns and ammunition without parental consent, and are solely responsible for crimes they commit using those weapons. We asked Fuson, the Brady Campaign spokeswoman, to find out why the campaign includes 18- and 19-year-olds in its calculation. In an email, she said the campaign used the CDC’s own metrics for measuring unintentional injuries. She pointed us to a report published by the center examining childhood injuries from 2000-06. The CDC did use data for ages 0-19, including injuries. The center uses the same age range in The National Action Plan for Child Injury Prevention. The CDC is the nation’s leading authority on mortality and injury statistics. The federal database includes information on thousands of death and emergency room records, and is regularly cited by lawmakers and activist groups. Data is categorized by four-year age ranges — 15-19 year olds, for example — in addition to many other metrics such as year, race and sex of victims. Users can also search the CDC website for statistics by any age or range. It is important to note, however, that the CDC says its data for unintentional gun injuries among children 16 and younger is shaky because the samples sizes are small. Another wrinkle: The agency has been caught in political cross-fire, with right-wing critics saying it collects and presents data in a way that supports gun-control efforts. Liberal supporters, meanwhile, say that criticism has had a chilling effect on CDC research into gun injuries and deaths. In short, not everyone agrees CDC data are unassailable. Last year, President Barack Obama ordered the CDC, in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings, to begin studying the causes of gun violence. That information is not yet available. The ruling: At a rally in Vancouver, Brady Campaign representatives claimed that, on average, nine children across the U.S. die every day from gunshot wounds. The group set up a display showing nine pairs of children’s shoes and a chalkboard that read: "9 kids every day will never have another birthday." PolitiFact Oregon checked that claim against government data using the Brady Campaign’s age range of 0-19, and found that about 7.81 children and teens die each day from gun violence, based on the most recent five-year average available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heidi Yewman, who organized the rally in Vancouver, said the incorrect number was a volunteer’s mistake. We found the difference between eight and nine not hugely significant. It’s horrible that children are dying of gunshot wounds, of course, but the difference in the two numbers is unlikely to materially change the debate about gun control. But including 18- and 19-year-olds, who are not "children" under legal and other definitions, significantly skews the numbers, making the problem seem much worse than it is. Because the group’s claim contained an element of truth but ignored critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12647	"Under the Republican health care repeal proposal North Carolina faces the 2nd highest premium increase in the nation. North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/mar/24/david-price/price-right-north-carolina-would-have-nations-seco/	As the U.S. House of Representatives prepares to vote on a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, North Carolina Rep. David Price said few people in the country will fare worse than North Carolinians if the repeal plan passes. "Under the Republican health care repeal proposal: North Carolina faces the 2nd highest premium increase in the nation," according to a report released by Price’s office. "North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500." The Republicans’ American Health Care Act would repeal the ACA (also known as Obamacare) and would, among many other changes, replace Obamacare’s income-based tax credits for health insurance with flat tax credits. More on all that later. It’s no surprise that Price, a Democrat who represents a liberal area of the Triangle, is against the AHCA. But the numbers he threw out were a bit surprising. They could also have big political consequences for the state’s 10 Republican members of the House of Representatives – if Price’s price is right. Price’s office repeated the claim nearly verbatim in a press release and took to social media urging people to read the report. Which version of the bill is Price talking about? Price made this claim Wednesday, when he shared his office’s report on social media, calling the bill, "devastating for lower-income and older North Carolinians." Note: We’re fact checking Price’s claim based on the original GOP legislation, since that was what his claim referred to. Shortly after Price made this claim, the GOP canceled a planned vote on the AHCA and re-wrote some parts of it; those changes have yet to be studied in-depth. For a breakdown of the AHCA’s proposed tax credits and other changes, see this primer from PolitiFact or this fact-check on how it affects different income levels. Price is talking about the effects on the more than half a million North Carolinians who buy their health insurance individually – not people who get it through their work or through government programs, like the VA or Medicaid. Those people on the individual marketplace are about 5 percent of the state’s population. So when Price says "North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500," that’s a bit misleading. The numbers are right – as we’ll explain shortly – but they don’t really apply to the average person, as Price insinuates. People who are insured through work or through government programs would see different effects than the average person buying insurance individually. Average cost increase Now let’s take a look at that "more than $7,500" average increase in costs under the AHCA. Price said that includes increases in both out-of-pocket expenses (by $5,921 on average) and insurance premiums (an average of $1,628 more). A premium is the cost of health insurance. Out-of-pocket expenses include copays, coinsurance and deductibles. And Price's math is solid. It’s been backed up by research by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care think tank, and by the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "Kaiser tends to be mechanically very sound," said David Anderson, a researcher at Duke University’s Health Policy Evidence Hub. "So if you see something from Kaiser, you can trust it." Anderson said the number Price cited on premium increases checks out, and the out-of-pocket expense figure is either correct or maybe slightly high. He said it’s "in the ballpark … maybe a little aggressive." Price is also correct that North Carolina’s increase would be the second-highest in the country. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Alaska is first by a long shot, but North Carolina’s average cost increase would be about $1,000 more than in the next state, which is Oklahoma. Alaska and North Carolina are No. 1 and 2 in both average increases and average total costs, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found. Why is North Carolina’s cost so high? North Carolina also has some of the highest costs under Obamacare. Part of the reason is that it has the country’s second-largest total rural population, as well as the highest percentage of rural residents among the 10 largest states. In rural areas where there tend to be fewer hospitals, Anderson said, insurance costs are higher. Urban areas, with more competition among hospitals, have lower health care costs. Obamacare controls for variations like that with tax credits based on income levels and local health care costs. The AHCA would instead give flat tax credits, which would cause wide variations everywhere – especially in North Carolina. So it’s hard to describe what would happen to a "typical" person if the bill becomes law. But here are a few examples of what could happen, as of 2020, if Obamacare is replaced by the AHCA, according to the Kaiser report. The figures include the final costs, after tax credits, for both health plans. A 60-year-old living in Cumberland County making $20,000 would see his premiums increase $19,750 – that’s not a typo – to $20,710 a year. A 27-year-old in Harnett County making $30,000 a year would see her premiums increase $1,260, to $3,740 a year. A 27-year-old in Johnston County making $50,000 would see her premiums decrease $1,860, to $3,240 a year. A 40-year-old making $50,000 a year would see his premiums… Decrease by $1,180 (to $3,920) in Wake County. Decrease by $20 (to $5,080) in Mecklenburg County. Increase by $560 (to $5,660) in Robeson County. In Durham County, a 40-year-old making $100,000 would pay $500 less ($6,640). A 60-year-old making $100,000 would pay $3,710 more ($18,880). A 60-year-old making $30,000 would pay $13,900 more ($16,380). Those findings are in line with research from Avik Roy, a conservative health care analyst. Roy was a health care policy advisor to the Republican presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney in 2012 and Rick Perry in 2016. Last week he wrote that "the AHCA’s approach, if left unchanged, would lead to significant spikes in net insurance premiums for lower-income participants in the individual insurance market, with particular problems for those in their fifties and sixties." He added that North Carolina is one of seven states where customers will fare the worst under the AHCA, due to its switch from an income-based tax credit to a flat tax credit. "A means-tested credit ... has one additional advantage over the method used currently in the AHCA," he wrote. "It does a better job of protecting those who live in high-cost states … like Alaska, Nebraska, Arizona, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Wyoming, and Louisiana." Future changes The studies we’ve examined so far evaluate what would happen between now and 2020. That year is the turning point, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, for when nationwide premiums might start to become lower on average. And why would premiums, on average, go down after 2020? The Congressional Budget Office estimated 14 million people will drop their health insurance next year if the AHCA passes, and there will be 21 million fewer insured people by 2020. Many of them would be older people with high costs, so their dropping insurance would drive average costs down. But those are national estimates. We wondered what would happen specifically in North Carolina after 2020. Unfortunately, we don’t really know. The bulk of state-specific research into the AHCA so far has focused on its immediate impact, pre-2020. Our ruling David Price said that if the AHCA passes in its current form, "North Carolina faces the 2nd highest premium increase in the nation. North Carolina residents will face an average cost increase of over $7,500." Price’s numbers are accurate, at least in the short term as it applies to people buying insurance on the individual market. However, we don’t know what might happen after 2020. And the wording of Price’s claim is misleading in describing average "North Carolina residents" with no qualifier. In reality, the changes apply only to the 5 percent of people buying health insurance on the individual market. For those reasons, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09890	"The government is going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves and use taxpayer dollars to do so."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/22/house-republicans/house-republicans-say-government-will-take-old-woo/	House Republicans are playing truth-squad with the cap-and-trade bill. Every day they post one claim about the bill on their Web site in an effort to demonstrate why cap-and-trade, which is intended to slow climate change by limiting carbon dioxide emissions, is bad for consumers. Most Republicans oppose the bill. "Daily Truth" No. 14, which deals with a government program on wood stoves, caught our eye: "The government is going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves and use taxpayer dollars to do so. The Democrats’ national energy tax is just more government intrusion and more taxpayer dollars used for government-imposed mandates." From the sound of this claim, it seems like the government would demand all wood stoves be replaced (we imagine packs of bureaucrats knocking down doors and tearing wood stoves out of walls). We wondered whether the cap-and-trade bill really contains such a requirement. Indeed, the bill does set aside about $20 million to replace old wood or pellet stoves — specifically, stoves manufactured before July 1, 1990 — with newer, more efficient models. The money would help consumers pay for the upgrade. They would receive a 30 percent tax credit for costs incurred, up to $1,500. As it does with most appliances, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets efficiency standards for wood stoves, and to get the tax credit, consumers would have to buy one that bears the "EPA certified" label. Supporters of the stove swap initiative say it could help reduce air pollution. According to the EPA, certified stoves emit about three-fourths less pollution than do older models. In some parts of the United States, consumers have already taken advantage of a pilot program encouraging people to buy new stoves, and the bill simply expands that to stove owners throughout the country. Republicans have it partly right about how the program would work. It would use taxpayer money to help consumers upgrade their older, dirtier stoves. And to get the rebate, consumers would have to buy an EPA-approved stove. However, the government is not forcing them to replace the stoves. "This is not a mandatory program," said Paul Heintz, communications director for Rep. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who helped come up with the plan. "Those who own stoves that are either not certified by the EPA or were built before 1990 simply have the opportunity to take advantage of this program. They are under no obligation to do so." So Republicans are right that taxpayer money is being used to subsidize upgraded stoves but they are distorting how the program works. The government is not "going to tell Americans they need to replace functioning stoves in their homes with 'government-certified' stoves." The government is merely offering an incentive to replace them. So we find the Republican claim Half True.

pomt-11518	"I never said Russia did not meddle in the election."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-denies-he-denied-russian-medd/	The indictments of 13 Russians detailing how they used Facebook and Twitter to undercut Hillary Clinton and promote President Donald Trump spurred a flurry of tweets from Trump over the weekend. "I never said Russia did not meddle in the election," Trump wrote Feb. 18. "I said ‘it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.’ The Russian ‘hoax’ was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump might want to focus on collusion, but his blanket denial that he ever questioned Russian meddling runs up against his own words. Early on, Trump treated any mention of Russian interference as an attack on the legitimacy of his victory. In a May 2017 interview with NBC’s Lester Holt, Trump said "this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story." Trump continued in that interview to say, "It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won." That statement earned him PolitiFact’s 2017 Lie of the Year. In September 2017, when reports of Russian-backed Facebook ads came out, Trump tweeted, "The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com When the Washington Post reported in December 2016 that the CIA had concluded that the Russians wanted to boost Trump’s chances, Trump rejected it. "We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College," he said on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, 2016. "I guess the final numbers are now at 306. She’s down to a very low number. No, I don’t believe that at all." In a December 2016 interview with Time, Trump said two things: He didn’t think Russia meddled, and that it might have. "I don’t believe they interfered," Trump said. "That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say ‘oh, Russia interfered.’" But a moment later he said, "I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals." During an overseas trip to Asia in November 2017, Trump spoke of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A reporter asked how Trump brought up the issue of Russian meddling in the U.S. election. "Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn't do that,’ " Trump said. "And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it." Asked again if he believed Putin, Trump called several top U.S. intelligence officials "political hacks," and argued that other matters were more important. "You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that," Trump said. "Now, you’re not going to get into an argument. You’re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine." So there are any number of occasions when Trump has denied Russian meddling across the board. But at other moments, he has acknowledged that it is possible. In the same interview with NBC’s Holt where he called the Russian thing "a made-up story," Trump also suggested that Russia might try to shape U.S. elections. "If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it’s a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it," Trump said. "And I want to make sure it will never, ever happen." At a January 2017 news conference, he said he thought Russia did hack into the DNC, but he blurred the picture. "As far as hacking, I think it was Russia," he said. "But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people." Pressed on his apparent acceptance of the intelligence agencies’ findings, Trump backpedaled. "All right, but you know what, it could have been others also," Trump said. Our ruling Trump said that he "never said that Russia did not meddle in the election." In reality, he called the matter a "made-up story," and a "hoax." He has said that he believes Russian President Putin’s denial of any Russian involvement. He told Time, "I don’t believe they (Russia) interfered." Even when he has acknowledged the possibility that the Russians interfered, he has added that it could have been other countries or even individuals. Trump’s denial doesn’t match what he has actually said. We rate this claim Pants on Fire! See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-02-19T14:12:24	2018-02-18	['Russia']
pomt-14168	Says LeBron James "stops paying his Social Security taxes at the beginning of the second quarter of the first game of the season."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/28/alan-grayson/lebron-james-pays-social-security-taxes-halftime-f/	Not only has U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson endorsed presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, he also has echoed one of the senator’s main platform planks that the rich should help shore up Social Security. At a Senate campaign debate with U.S. Rep. David Jolly, R-Indian Shores, in Orlando on April 25, 2016, Grayson said the Social Security payroll tax cap on earnings needs to be lifted in order to make the program solvent. He used the mind-boggling salary of professional basketball superstar LeBron James to illustrate his point. "Let's talk about LeBron James. Do you know when he stops paying his Social Security taxes? He stops paying his Social Security taxes at the beginning of the second quarter of the first game of the season," Grayson said. "Rest of the game, pays nothing. Rest of the 81 games of the season, pays nothing. The offseason, still pays nothing. That's ridiculous." The Cleveland Cavaliers forward rakes in an average of $23.5 million per year as part of his current two-year contract, so it’s not like he’s going to depend on Social Security in his twilight years. But is Grayson right that James is done paying into the program before halftime of the first game of the season? It’s not a slam dunk, but the Orlando Democrat does score points with this one. Tax tip-off Let’s start by reviewing what Grayson is talking about. The federal government imposes a payroll tax of 6.2 percent on wages to pay into the Social Security fund. But there’s a limit of how much income can be taxed. This maximum amount, which is periodically adjusted upward, was $118,500 in 2016. That means the most any employed person pays into Social Security annually is $7,347 (6.2 percent of $118,500). If you make less than $118,500, you obviously are taxed on that amount and pay less. Employers match that amount, so a single worker’s total contribution to Social Security is essentially a maximum of $14,694 per year. Benefits, for the record, also are capped. In the case of self-employment, the person pays both halves of the $14,694 contribution, or 12.4 percent of $118,500. We’ll come back to this in a moment. If you make more than $118,500 in salary from an employer — say, $23.5 million or so — you’re still only on the hook for taxes on the maximum of $118,500. That’s the highest amount on which the government can tax anyone, LeBron James or otherwise. Grayson has said that this limit is exacerbating projected Social Security deficits as more people retire. Not only would lifting this cap keep the program solvent, it would allow the government to increase benefits for seniors. President Barack Obama also has proposed lifting this cap, which has rated a Promise Broken on our Obameter. Some argue that raising the maximum taxable wage base wouldn’t fix the system on its own. For his James example, Grayson broke down the NBA 82 regular-season games into their 328 respective quarters, then divided that against James’ $23.5 million average salary. That amounts to $71,646.34 per quarter, which is almost $6,000 per minute, with 12-minute quarters. Not bad for a night’s work. Using that math, James hits the $118,500 taxable earnings cap somewhere before the eighth minute of the second quarter of the first game of the season. You’re probably only on your second (maybe third) $11 beer by then. Now, this interpretation is obviously just to make Grayson’s point easier to understand. It’s kind of like Tax Freedom Day, ostensibly the day people earn enough to pay their total tax bill. How James gets paid depends on the structure of his contract. We'll also note that the NBA season starts in October, with the playoffs running through June. The tax year starts Jan. 1 and runs the calendar year. That makes the actual timing of when taxes are deducted from James' pay different than what Grayson said — a minor detail in a broad example. The Cavaliers' first game of 2016 was on Jan. 2, and was their 31st contest of the 2015-16 season. They beat the Orlando Magic, 104-79, by the way. It may sound minor to those of us not making millions annually, but while Grayson is sticking to the game clock, he understates James’ time commitment. This example doesn’t include the hours James spends practicing, traveling, giving interviews, attending team events or anything else that goes along with a superstar athlete’s life. It also doesn’t include preseason games, overtime, playoff games (which bring in more money) or the value of his endorsements, which Forbes estimated at $48 million. PKF O’Connor Davies sports accountant Robert Raiola also cautions that Grayson’s example doesn’t mention other taxes James must pay. Raiola pointed out James faces a 1.45 percent Medicare tax that includes no cap, plus a 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge on all the income he makes over $250,000. Which is a lot. And don’t forget that self-employment tax. James possibly also must pay that in some form, depending on how his income is structured, Raiola said. How that affects James depends on how he conducts his finances, so it’s not really possible to say without getting a peek into his books. (LeBron, if you’re reading, email us and we’ll talk.) But Grayson’s talking point — that no matter how much the mega-rich earn, they are only taxed on the maximum of $118,500 in income — holds up. If you make less than that, you pay less, but James isn’t required to pay Social Security payroll taxes on his income beyond $118,500. Our ruling Grayson said James "stops paying his Social Security taxes at the beginning of the second quarter of the first game of the season." That’s a broad statement meant to draw attention to the fact that Social Security taxes are capped at $118,500 of a person’s income, no matter how much they make. There are a lot of factors that go into how much James is paid, and how much of that goes to various taxes. But the bottom line is that the athlete only faces Social Security taxes for a relative sliver of his income. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7010f3db-ddad-4d0d-98a5-197ed37eab1a UPDATE, April 28: An astute reader pointed out a minor flaw in Grayson's specific talking point. The NBA season starts in the fall, while the tax year begins Jan. 1. As such, James hypothetically would hit the threshold in the second quarter of the first game he played in the new calendar year, not the first game of the season. We've added that information to this story. But Grayson's point that the uber-wealthy quickly hit the Social Security tax cap remains just as valid.

pomt-14276	"The economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/apr/06/hillary-clinton/does-economy-always-do-better-under-democratic-pre/	Hillary Clinton talked big about the economy, including raising the minimum wage and equal pay for women, at a rally ahead of Arizona’s Presidential Preference Election. "The economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House," Clinton said March 21 at Carl Hayden Community High School in Phoenix. The Clinton family love these comparisons, by the way. In 2015, PolitiFact ruled Mostly True claims from Hillary Clinton a claim that ,"Under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats," and another that, "The stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House." At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton had this statement rated True: "Since 1961 … our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)." The score, however, isn’t as good for this particular Clinton claim. Other factors involved Clinton’s Arizona spokesman, Tim Hogan, pointed us to a July 2014 study on the topic from Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. The study concludes that Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947, when the data was first tracked. However, the economists point out that there are other factors, such as better oil prices and international conditions, that could be driving these better numbers for Democratic presidents. In short, Democrats occupying the Oval Office tend to have a little better luck. Experts we spoke with largely held the same views. Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the statistics, from GDP to the unemployment rate, are striking, but noted that the president does not have "all that control." "That doesn’t prove what the cause is," Frankel said. (Update: After this item published, we heard from Frankel who said he believed Clinton's statement was accurate because Clinton did not say that Democrats caused the gap in performance. You can read more on his views here.) Robert Shapiro, chairman of Washington D.C. economic advisory firm Sonecon, said Clinton is right, but with the same caveat. "The details, of course, depend on how and what you compare, since the economy performs better in certain periods than others," Shapiro said. Christian Weller, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, did his own math on the GDP data since 1947. He found that the economy, through the last quarter of 2015 and after inflation, grew 3.8 percent under Democrats and 2.4 percent under Republicans. For President Barack Obama, the growth rate in his first term was 1.8 percent. His current growth rate is 2 percent, but that’s still higher than his predecessor, George W. Bush. And his second term hasn’t ended yet. Based on estimates, Weller said Obama should hit the 2.4 percent Republican average. Still, Ronald Reagan’s 3.4 percent growth rate is well ahead of the economy right now under Obama. "Other than Obama, every Democrat had a faster growth rate, even (Jimmy) Carter had a slightly higher growth rate than Reagan," Weller said. "This is one of the safest talking points for a Democratic contender." However, the asterisks bother Arizona State University presidential historian Brooks Simpson. "Secretary Clinton is not exactly telling the whole truth,’" Simpson said. Simpson referenced Bill Clinton’s administration, noting that he benefited from some of the economic policies of his predecessor, Republican George H.W. Bush. A 2011 report from the right-leaning Heritage Foundation notes that the economy was already in its "22nd month of expansion" when Bill Clinton took office in January 1993. Our ruling Hillary Clinton said, "the economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House." Yes, Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947. But Clinton's comments require several caveats. The current growth in the economy under Obama is lower than the Republican average. Factors such as oil prices also reflect the higher GDP growth under Democratic presidents. On top of that, comparing one period of time to another or one president to another can be problematic. On balance, we rate Clinton's claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5799cbf2-451d-4bea-bb10-cd4dd1203e8b	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-06T18:00:00	2016-03-21	['White_House', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-00574	"Former Gov. Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-rick-perry-signed-law-intended-dis/	In a speech at Texas Southern University, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton had no qualms condemning GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry in his home state. "Former Gov, Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters," she said on June 4, 2015. Perry called Clinton’s claim "way outside the norm of ridiculous" on CNN’s State of the Union a few days later. "I could probably find a federal judge to say just about anything," he stated. We did not hear back from the Perry campaign, so we delved into the law’s mired legal history. Senate Bill 14 is the law Clinton is referring to. It requires Texas voters to present a limited number of acceptable government-issued photo IDs at the ballot box; gun licenses count while student IDs don’t. The Texas Legislature passed the bill in March 2011, and Perry signed it into law on May 27. The law was in limbo for two years, until the Supreme Court struck down a section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on June 23, 2013. The section had mandated federal pre-approval of election laws in Texas and eight other states that historically discriminated against minority voters. With the court ruling, states could move ahead with changes. That same day, then-Texas Attorney General and current Gov. Greg Abbott announced the law would "take effect immediately." A few months later, in October 2013, federal Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos struck down the voter ID law in a consolidated suit filed against the state by U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, the NAACP, and the Mexican American Legislative Council. "The court holds that SB 14 creates a substantial burden on the fundamental right to vote, has a discriminatory effect and purpose, and constitutes a poll tax," Ramos wrote in her ruling. "The evidence in the record demonstrates that proponents of SB 14 … were motivated, at the very least in part, because of and not merely in spite of the voter ID law’s detrimental effects on the African-American and Hispanic electorate." Ramos’ injunction against the voter ID law was temporarily stayed by the Fifth Circuit of Appeals, which permitted the law to remain in place in Texas for the 2014 midterm elections. That ruling was backed by the Supreme Court. The case is now back at the Fifth Circuit, which heard oral arguments in April 2015. So the law’s ultimate fate is still unknown. Our ruling Clinton said, "Former Gov. Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters." The law in question requires a photo ID from Texas voters and was greenlit by Perry in 2011. Federal judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos struck the law down in 2013. While that ruling was stayed by two higher courts, Ramos clearly described the law as discriminatory in her ruling. However, it's important to note that courts are still considering whether or not the law will be allowed to stand. Clinton’s carefully worded statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True. Clarification, June 10, 2015: We revised the wording of the decisions from the Fifth Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court to clarify that the two higher courts did not overturn Ramos' ruling. They temporarily stayed Ramos' injunction against Texas' voter ID law.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-06-09T12:15:28	2015-06-04	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-14294	"We’ve rebuilt China."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-chinas-economic-growth-thanks-un/	China is doing all the winning as the United States continue to lose in global trade, says Donald Trump, and it’s all thanks to us. Trump, who admires China’s GDP growth and Great Wall but considers it a master manipulator of the world, railed against the country that’s become one of his favorite targets in an interview with the New York Times. "You know, we’ve rebuilt China," Trump said. "The money they’ve drained out of the United States has rebuilt China. And they’ve done it through monetary manipulation, by devaluations. And very sophisticated. I mean, they’re grand chess players at devaluation." We were curious about Trump’s claim that the United States is responsible for China’s rapid economic growth. He made the point several times in the New York Times interview alone. (We also fact-checked two others claim from the interview about China’s import tax and its activity in the South China Sea.) According to Trump in the New York Times, China’s transition from one of the poorest countries in the world to its second-largest economy was possible through "bad trade deals" with the United States. This is an overly simplistic casting of the economic relationship between the two countries. Experts disagree over the extent of the United State’s impact in the Chinese economy, but they say Trump’s claim ignores many other factors at play. "In one tiny sense, Trump is correct," said Scott Lincicome, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute who specializes in international trade politics. "Trade with all countries, including the United States, has been part of a major market reform that’s lifted millions out of poverty in China. Reforms to property and taxation have been much more fundamental." Economists point to the opening up of China in the late 1970s and early 1980s as the beginning of its meteoric growth. Following the death of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping introduced economic reforms and open trade with the West in 1979. From then to 2014, China saw double-digit growth in GDP every year, effectively doubling its economy every eight years, according to the Congressional Research Service. Arguably, China’s economic liberalization, and subsequent prosperity, was prompted by years of U.S. efforts at rapprochement through Henry Kissinger’s secret visits, Richard Nixon’s historic trip and, of course, ping pong. In 2000, the United States also lobbied for China’s inclusion in the World Trade Organization (as Trump mentions on his website), further embedding Beijing in the world economy. Today, the United States and China are each other’s largest trading partners. Trump has argued that the United States is "losing" given the trade imbalance between the two countries, but whether this benefits or hurts the United States is up for debate. "I would not say that American deficits rebuilt China, but they probably allowed China to rebuild itself at a much lower domestic political cost than otherwise," said Michael Pettis, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and professor at Peking University. "Our consumption has benefitted the Chinese people, just like how the consumption of Europe and everyone has," said Lincicome. "American demand has helped Chinese companies, so there’s a nugget of truth to that, but we’re not the only ones." By Trump’s logic, you could argue that China has also rebuilt America by providing America with cheaper goods and thus more savings, pointed out Zhiwu Chen, a Yale University economics and finance professor who specializes in the Chinese economy. "Without those savings or Chinese financing of American government debt and corporate investments, the U.S. would not have been able to sustain the kind of growth in real estate, defense and business for so many years," Chen said. "In an interlinked globalized world, it is really hard to say who is rebuilding whom." Our ruling Trump said, "We’ve rebuilt China." China’s economic growth can largely be attributed to its in-house reforms and inclusion in global trade. The United States can take some, but certainly not all, of the credit for the latter.

pomt-08282	"Discretionary spending went up 84 percent in the last two years"	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/07/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-us-discretionary-spending-increased/	U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican, and incoming chairman of the House Budget Committee, is known for his mastery of math and fondness for figures. In one notable episode, Ryan directly confronted President Barack Obama at an open meeting of House Republicans in Baltimore in January 2010. . "The spending bills that you have signed into law, the domestic discretionary spending has been increased by 84 percent," Ryan told the president, in the televised exchange. Obama pushed back on the number, and the wonky episode might otherwise have been forgotten, but Republican candidates and incoming House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio repeated similar claims through the fall election. Most recently, Ryan was again quoted as saying it by the Racine Journal Times in the wake of the Nov. 2 election: "Discretionary spending went up 84 percent in the last two years." That’s a big increase. And, with Ryan set to take over the House Budget Committee, one worth sorting out. The backup for his claim can be found in a June 4, 2010 news release issued in the name of the budget committee’s Republican caucus. In it, Ryan makes clear he is talking about non-defense discretionary spending. Discretionary spending goes for such things as education, health and housing -- in contrast to mandatory expenditures such as Social Security and Medicare "entitlements." Outside experts that PolitiFact Wisconsin spoke with quibble a bit about the annual budget figures Ryan uses, but the numbers are not really in dispute. And they do show a big jump -- from $434 billion in 2008 to $537 billion in 2010. But that’s a 24 percent increase, not the 84 percent claimed by Ryan and his colleagues. Is someone’s math fuzzy? Let’s dig in to find out. Ryan’s calculations also include another number -- the discretionary spending portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the economic stimulus package. That adds another $259 million to the total, which brings it to $797 billion (with rounding) and the 84 percent. One problem, and it’s a significant one in terms of Ryan’s statement: The stimulus package was approved in February 2009. Ryan includes it in the 2010 totals, so the two-year trend under Obama looks like a rocket headed straight up. If you put it in 2009 -- when it was passed -- the two-year trend under Obama looks more like a roller-coaster ride: Up a lot, and then down some but not all the way. Let’s turn to some budget watchdog groups to assess the approach. First, not everyone agrees it’s appropriate to even include the stimulus money in the calculation, since it could be considered one-time emergency spending -- not part of the underlying base. The annual figures that are the basis of Ryan’s chart do not include emergency spending, such as for natural disasters or unforeseen war costs. Obama and Democrats argue the stimulus package -- which tallied $862 billion in all --- was the ultimate "emergency" allocation aimed at preventing another Great Depression. Most experts told PolitiFact Wisconsin it’s fine to include it, as long as it appears as a one-time blip -- creating that roller-coaster rise and fall. "The discretionary spending in the stimulus bill has already begun to fade and no one assumes stimulus bill levels of spending will continue every year into the future," said Joshua Gordon, policy director at The Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that advocates for fiscal responsibility. His group and the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities agree the stimulus funding should be placed in 2009. That’s when the vote occurred, when the spending authority for nearly all of it was granted, and that’s how the Congressional Budget Office records it. And Ryan’s own press release, in the fine print, refers to the stimulus funds as 2009 spending. Putting them in 2010 may make a stronger rhetorical point, but a shaky mathematical one. Why did Ryan do it that way? In response, Ryan’s office said in an e-mail he presents the budget figure on the chart with and without stimulus funding "so readers can separate the two if they wish." But in his public statements about the increase, he doesn’t separate them at all. He uses the higher, skewed number. Ryan’s office also says the cumulative view, not the year to year, is what’s important in the spending trend. They say if you just look at 2008 and 2010, it’s as if the stimulus never occurred. But the stimulus money was a one time authorization. It is not part of the annual base, so following past Washington accounting practice it belongs in the year it was approved. Finally, Ryan’s office argues his analysis does not include the vast majority of the stimulus spending. That’s certainly true. But it’s Ryan who limits the statement -- and the discussion of it -- to discretionary spending and when budget authority was granted. Ryan aides said the congressman is not using the figures to make Obama look bad -- he blames the long-term increase in spending on both parties.. "He is making a policy argument that we should return to sustainable levels of government spending," said spokesman Conor Sweeney. To be sure, no matter what year you stick it in, that $259 billion in discretionary stimulus funding -- and the massive overall package -- represents a dramatic spending leap. But if you put it in 2009 -- where evidence says it belongs -- you get a different picture than the one presented by Ryan. If it is there, the change in discretionary spending under Obama was a 70 percent increase in the first year, followed by a 27 percent drop in the second. That second year is still higher than the starting point, because non-stimulus spending also rose. That brings us back to the 24 percent overall increase between 2008 and 2010, which is where we began. And that’s where we will end. In illustrating his point about spending increases under President Obama, Ryan says non-defense discretionary spending has risen 84 percent. There is no doubt that spending is up, or that the one-time stimulus package was a major driver. But sliding the stimulus money from 2009 to 2010 -- whether on a chart or in an interview -- skews the picture. It’s a nifty accounting maneuver. But still a maneuver. We rate Ryan’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08421	Under the new health care law, "the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat. That is called a panel."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/19/john-raese/john-raese-says-health-care-law-forces-patients-go/	During the West Virginia Senate debate on Oct. 18, 2010, Democratic Gov. Joe Manchin and Republican businessman John Raese sparred over a number of topics, including the Democratic-backed health care law passed earlier this year. We were especially intrigued by one criticism raised against the law by Raese. A questioner asked Raese: "You have said you want to repeal the health care legislation Congress passed earlier this year. What is it about this new law specifically that you do not like?" Raese jumped right in. "Well, I don't like socialism, to tell you the truth, and when you have a doctor-patient relationship -- that's the way it's supposed to be, and that's the way we have the greatest health care system in the world, and that's the way it is right now," Raese said. "That's all going to change because from here on out under Obamacare, something Gov. Manchin has always supported, you're going to have a patient-bureaucrat relationship, because the first person that patient has to go to is a bureaucrat. That is called a panel. I disagree with it. ... I'd like to repeal every part of it, because it is pure, unadulterated socialism. It is the worst bill ever to come out of the U.S. Senate and House." We decided to check one specific part of Raese's statement -- that under the new health care law, "the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat. That is called a panel." First, some background on the law. The goal is to expand coverage and reduce costs while leaving employer-provided insurance largely in place. To help people who have to buy insurance on their own, the law creates state-based exchanges, which are virtual marketplaces where individuals and small businesses can comparison shop. People of modest means would receive tax credits to buy insurance on these insurance exchanges. Employers are not required to offer insurance, but large companies must pay penalties if they don't offer insurance and if their employees qualify for new health insurance tax credits. The plan also expands eligibility for insurance programs like Medicaid. People who don't buy insurance and who don't qualify for programs like Medicaid would have to pay a penalty on their taxes. When we first saw Raese's comment, we were a bit flummoxed, because after roughly two years of fact-checking dozens of claims on the health care bill, we didn't recall any requirement that patients go through "bureaucrats" to reach their doctor. When we contacted the Raese campaign, they pointed us to a July 27, 2010, news release by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. It touts the "Health Care Bureaucrats Elimination Act," co-sponsored with four other Republican senators. The bill would repeal one element of the health care law called the Independent Payment Advisory Board. In the release, Cornyn called the IPAB "the definition of a government takeover. America’s seniors deserve the ability to hold elected officials accountable for the decisions that affect their Medicare, but IPAB would take that away from seniors and put power in the hands of politically-appointed Washington bureaucrats. This bill to repeal IPAB is just one step towards starting over with real health care reform that empowers patients instead of beltway bureaucrats." The IPAB is real. Whether its existence supports Raese's claim that "the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat" is another matter. Here's how the Kaiser Family Foundation -- an independent health-care research group -- summarized the 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board. The board would "submit legislative proposals containing recommendations to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if spending exceeds a target growth rate." If Medicare spending is found to exceed certain inflation benchmarks, the board, beginning in January 2014, "will submit recommendations to achieve reductions in Medicare spending." Then, beginning January 2018, if the appropriate inflation targets are not met, the board will submit proposals to the president and Congress for immediate consideration." However, Kaiser Family Foundation adds that the board "is prohibited from submitting proposals that would ration care, increase revenues or change benefits, eligibility or Medicare beneficiary cost sharing (including Parts A and B premiums), or would result in a change in the beneficiary premium percentage or low-income subsidies under Part D. Hospitals and hospices (through 2019) and clinical labs (for one year) will not be subject to cost reductions proposed by the board. The board must also submit recommendations every other year to slow the growth in national health expenditures while preserving quality of care by January 1, 2015." So the board is real. And Cornyn and his allies may have a case to make that the IPAB is a bad idea or poorly designed. Still, we don't see how its existence justifies Raese's statement. -- The board's purview is limited to Medicare. Patients who have employer-provided health care, Medicaid or insurance through the health care exchange would not be affected at all by the board. -- The board's powers are advisory. The board can only make recommendations, and it is expressly prohibited from anything that would "ration care, increase revenues or change benefits, eligibility or Medicare beneficiary cost sharing ... or (change) the beneficiary premium percentage or low-income subsidies" in the Medicare drug benefit. -- The board doesn't interact with patients. The board is supposed to do big thinking about cost-containment, not judge individual patients to determine whether they qualify for care. The changes that it suggests to the president and Congress could eventually, many years hence, shape how care is provided. But it's a major stretch to say that under the new law "the first person (a) patient has to go to is a bureaucrat." -- Patients didn't live in a bureacracy-fee paradise before the health care law passed. Today, patients may need to check with an insurance company before undergoing a procedure or making a visit to the specialist. If an employer's HR department decides to change health care plans, a worker may have to drop a doctor or give up benefits. And employers can eliminate health insurance entirely, or drive up the cost of premiums, either of which could intefere with a patient's health care. Though the Raese camp didn't mention it, we'll also pre-emptively dismiss any notion that the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute -- another entity created by the bill -- could wedge "bureaucrats" between a doctor and a patient. This institute, which would conduct research that compares the clinical effectiveness of medical treatments, is at least as controversial, if not more so, since it fed critics' fears that the bill could result in the rationing of health care services. However, the law prevents the institute's findings from being considered mandates. When we sent Raese's comment around to health care experts, they universally said he overreached. "This is purely ridiculous," said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. "Nothing changes in that respect relative to today’s system." "Choices, if anything, will be enhanced through the exchanges, with a much clearer description of what plans cover and their cost-sharing requirements," said Sara Collins, vice president of the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund's Program on Affordable Health Insurance. "In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services has to certify that qualified plans offered through the exchanges have adequate provider networks." Henry Aaron, a senior fellow with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, called the statement a "rant, appalling if based on ignorance, and mendacious if uttered knowingly." Even a major critic of the health care bill said he thought Raese went too far. "As bad as I think this bill is, I don’t see that anywhere in it," said Michael Tanner, a health care specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute. We usually accept a bit of overstatement if it's in the vein of artistic license. But Raese's statement is a gross distortion, along the lines of his subsequent claim that the law is "pure, unadulterated socialism." (The law preserves the private-sector health care insurance for most Americans who already have it, and lawmakers rejected a single-payer model early on.) We see Raese's claim as yet another attempt to demonize the health care law by twisting the facts beyond recognition. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-07026	Says that President Obama said, "Nobody made these guys go to war. ... Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice?"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/04/chain-email/barack-obama-said-troops-whine-and-nobody-made-the/	Did you get this e-mail? It says President Barack Obama said the troops "whine about bearing the costs of their choice" and that "Nobody made these guys go to war." We've gotten many copies of these e-mails forwarded to us by readers. It's similar to another chain e-mail we fact-checked awhile back, but since this new version keeps arriving, we thought we'd look at it again. It's still Pants-on-Fire wrong. This particular e-mail seems aimed at veterans and their friends and family members. If someone has to explain this to you, You are not a veteran. ... He [Obama] doesn't seem to have much respect for the military. Maybe in the future our leaders should be veterans. THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO SEE THIS!! THE MOST STUPID STATEMENT EVER BY A PRESIDENT. Bad press, including major mockery of the play by comedian Jon Stewart, led to President Obama abandoning his proposal to require veterans carry private health insurance to cover the estimated $540 billion annual cost to the federal government of treatment for injuries to military personnel received during their tours on active duty. The President admitted that he was puzzled by the magnitude of the opposition to his proposal. "Look, it's an all volunteer force," Obama complained. "Nobody made these guys go to war. They had to have known and accepted the risks. Now they whine about bearing the costs of their choice? It doesn't compute.." "I thought these were people who were proud to sacrifice for their country," Obama continued. "I wasn't asking for blood, just money. With the country facing the worst financial crisis in its history, I'd have thought that the patriotic thing to do would be to try to help reduce the nation's deficit.. I guess I underestimated the selfishness of some of my fellow Americans." If he thinks he will ever get another vote from an Active Duty, Reserve, National Guard service member or veteran of a military service he ought to think it over ... If you or a family member is or has served their country please pass this to them. To begin with, President Obama never said these words. They actually come from the humorist John Semmens, who writes satire on the news. In fact, we've fact-checked two other chain e-mails that we've found to be rip-offs of Semmens' pieces, passed off as real facts. One chain e-mail claimed Rep. Gabrielle Giffords urged the military to stab or club their opponents instead of shooting them, as a way to reduce carbon emissions and protect the environment. Another said Obama wanted to change the national anthem to "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing." We awarded both chain e-mails Pants on Fire ratings. In the case of this chain e-mail, Semmens wrote his report in March 2009 after the White House abandoned a plan to bill veterans' private insurers for their war-related injuries. It was intended as a cost-savings measure, to save the Veterans Administration $540 million a year. By the way, note that the chain e-mail changes that price tag to $540 billion, with a "b". That too is inaccurate. Veterans groups opposed the plan, and the White House scuttled the idea. Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a press release on the matter on March 18, 2009: "The President demonstrated his deep commitment to veterans by proposing the largest increase in the VA budget in 30 years and calling VSO (Veterans Service Organizations) and MSO (Military Service Organizations) leaders into the White House for an unprecedented meeting to discuss various aspects of the budget proposal," Gibbs said. "In considering the third party billing issue, the administration was seeking to maximize the resources available for veterans; however, the President listened to concerns raised by the VSOs that this might, under certain circumstances, affect veterans and their families' ability to access health care. Therefore, the President has instructed that its consideration be dropped. The President wants to continue a constructive partnership with the VSOs and MSOs and is grateful to those VSOs and MSOs who have worked in good faith with him on the budget proposal." Not only have we fact-checked this before, but our friends at other fact-checking organizations -- Factcheck.org and Snopes-- have also debunked it. In fact, the chain e-mail is pretty much the opposite of Obama's actual comments about the troops. For example, here's what he said to troops in Afghanistan on March 28, 2010. "You've been there for us, tour after tour, year after year, at a time when too many American institutions have let us down, when too many institutions have put short-term gain in front of a commitment to duty and a commitment to what's right," Obama said. "You've met your responsibilities, you've done your duty -- not just when it's easy. That's why you've inspired your fellow Americans. That's why you inspire me. That's why you've earned your place next to the very greatest of American generations. And all of you represent the virtues and the values that America so desperately needs right now: sacrifice and selflessness, honor and decency." Or what he said to troops at Fort Cambell on May 6, 2011, in the days after Osama bin Laden was killed. "And today, here at Fort Campbell, I had the privilege of meeting the extraordinary Special Ops folks who honored that promise. It was a chance for me to say —- on behalf of all Americans and people around the world —- 'Job well done.' Job well done. They're America's 'quiet professionals' -- because success demands secrecy. But I will say this. Like all of you, they could have chosen a life of ease. But like you, they volunteered. They chose to serve in a time of war, knowing they could be sent into harm's way. They trained for years. They're battle-hardened. They practiced tirelessly for this mission. And when I gave the order, they were ready." Or what he said to troops at Fort Drum on June 23, 2011. "The reason that I know many of you continue to do the outstanding work that you do is not only love of country but it's also love for each other, and your commitment to making sure that those sacrifices were not in vain. So the main message I have for all of you here today is that the American people understand the sacrifices you're making; they understand the sacrifices that your families are making. ... So, for all the sacrifices that you've made, I want to say thank you." The chain e-mail that purports to be Obama's comments on troops is maliciously false. It's particularly egregious for trying to ply veterans with false information. We rate this one Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-07-04T19:44:12	2011-06-22	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-11487	Says Stephen F. Austin and James Bowie promoted slavery.	true	/texas/statements/2018/mar/01/ann-teich/austin-school-board-member-says-stephen-f-austin-a/	An Austin school board member hinted at the stain of slavery in the Old South when she warned that changing the names of schools named after Texans with Confederate roles makes it logical to change the names of even more schools. Austin school Trustee Ann Teich said at the school board’s Feb. 26, 2018, meeting that if the board was set on keeping the names of people who supported slavery from tainting schools, it should further move to change the names of Austin’s Stephen F. Austin and James Bowie high schools, because Austin and Bowie each promoted slavery. "That is only fair," Teich said, going on: "James Bowie was a slave trader with his brother. Stephen F. Austin did nothing to stop slavery being brought into the state of Texas." That night, Teich and another board member were on the losing end of a 7-2 board decision to rename five schools named after military figures or other officials in the Confederacy. We wondered later about Teich’s Bowie and Austin descriptions. Was each pioneer of Anglo Texas also pro-slavery? We turned first for evidence to biographical entries in the Handbook of Texas published by the Texas State Historical Association. The handbook’s Bowie entry says Bowie teamed with a brother and traded slaves after the War of 1812 in what later became the state of Louisiana. Also, the entry says, the brothers in February 1831 sold landholdings and 82 slaves to Natchez investors for $90,000. The publication’s entry for Austin, who led the Anglo colonization of Texas, says that after 1833, Austin consistently declared that Texas must be a slave state. Also, Texas Christian University historian Gregg Cantrell says in a video posted with the entry that Austin saw his colony’s future at the time that Mexico ruled depending on a booming cotton economy that attracted American colonists and slave labor. We learned more directly from Cantrell, who last year told the Austin American-Statesman that Austin’s attitude toward slavery was complicated in that he considered U.S. slavery a necessary evil. Cantrell told us by phone: "It’s unequivocal: At points in their lives, both men were slave owners. There are no ifs, ands or buts about that." Cantrell said in his 1999 book on Austin’s life that Austin "helped to bring slavery to Texas and struggled to preserve it." Also, Cantrell wrote, Austin earlier "used hired slave labor on a large scale in the family mining business, and he himself owned one or two slaves during most of his years in Texas." Yet the book also says that after the republic won its independence, Austin drafted a proclamation barring the African slave trade in advance of Texas becoming a U.S. state; he died in December 1836. To learn about Bowie, who died at the Alamo, we took Cantrell’s suggestion and perused "Three Roads to the Alamo," a 1999 book by historian William C. Davis tracing the lives of Bowie, David Crockett and William Barret Travis. According to the book, Bowie’s father kept slaves as the family moved south from Kentucky before settling in what became Louisiana. Bowie and two brothers subsequently got into the slave trade as young men, Davis wrote, despite that being banned by law as of 1808. "To young men of ambition who did not scruple violating federal law, the profits could be considerable," Davis wrote. The book specifies that slaves were sold at $1 a pound with the average healthy man costing $140. Aside from profiting from such trade, the book says, Bowie once sold his own slave, Henry, 19, to a cousin. Also, the book says, Bowie and other family members sold land and 80 slaves in 1831. In the book, Davis calls apocryphal a tale that Bowie in 1821 saved a runaway slave and thrashed the person pursuing him. "Given that slaves in general were property to Bowie," Davis wrote, "and this one in particular could have meant profit, it is inconceivable that he would act to help the runaway." We reached Davis by email. He replied: "No question Bowie owned slaves, most for resale, but at different times had" a "personal slave or slaves as well." We left Teich a phone message about her claim and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Teich told board colleagues that Austin and Bowie, key figures in the founding of Anglo Texas, each promoted slavery. Austin and Bowie each owned slaves. Austin believed his colony’s success required slaves and also that Texas should join the U.S. as a slave state. Bowie and two brothers earlier traded in slaves.

pomt-13832	Says GOP Senate nominee Darryl Glenn said he wants to see Ted Cruz appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court.	true	/colorado/statements/2016/jul/13/michael-bennet/bennet-campaign-says-gop-senate-candidate-darryl-g/	For months Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado has run upbeat ads while more than a dozen Republican candidates slugged it out to become their party’s Senate nominee. But now that El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn has emerged as the victor in the Republican primary, the Bennet team has branded him as the candidate of "the fringe of the Republican Party" who is "too extreme for Colorado." In a recent fundraising email, the Bennet team ticked off things Glenn has said as proof that he’s "ultra-conservative." It included him saying on a conservative talk radio show, "I for one want to see (Ted) Cruz as a Supreme Court appointee." Yet, it appears unlikely that Glenn would view his passionate support of Cruz -- the Texas senator who lost his bid for the GOP presidential nomination -- as a negative. "I am an unapologetic Christian, constitutional conservative, pro-life, Second Amendment-loving American!" Glenn declared in a fiery speech that ignited the Colorado Republican Convention in April. The county commissioner, who had been struggling to raise campaign funding, swept up 70 percent of the convention vote and was the only GOP Senate candidate to win election to the ballot. (Others had to hire signature gatherers to petition their way onto the ballot). Soon Glenn was drawing endorsements from conservative standard bearers like Cruz and former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and receiving crucial funding from the Senate Conservatives Fund. Just days before the state primary last month, Cruz came to Colorado and publicly endorsed Glenn, who told the crowd at the Westin Denver International Airport that if Cruz didn’t somehow wrestle the presidential nomination from Donald Trump, then Glenn had another job in mind for the Texas firebrand. "If he cannot be our next president of the United States of America, I am personally going to lead the charge to make sure he’s our next Supreme Court justice," Glenn said, stirring the crowd to give Cruz a standing ovation, according to the Denver Post. Later, in a backroom, Glenn reinforced the idea, telling Cruz, "I’m very serious about the Supreme Court, if that (presidential nomination) doesn't happen," the Post reported. Glenn made the Cruz-for-the-high court comment that the Bennet campaign quoted in its June 17 email on conservative commentator Mark Levin’s nationally syndicated talk show. (Here's a recording of the interview. Glenn makes the comment at 5:05 on the recording). "I am very serious about winning this race. We need to send a clear message, because what I want, I want an overwhelming victory so I can go to Washington, D.C., with a mandate, and send some reinforcements to Mr. Cruz. And I for one want to see Mr. Cruz as a Supreme Court appointee," Glenn said on the show. PolitiFact has asked the Glenn campaign for comment and hasn't received a reply as of publication. We’ll update the story if they respond. Our ruling In a fundraising email, the Michael Bennet campaign quoted Darryl Glenn saying, "I for one want to see Cruz as a Supreme Court appointee."

pomt-11854	"IDC members also get tons of campaign money from real estate, charter school, and health care lobbyists, some of whom are Republicans with connections to Trump"	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/nov/05/creative-resistance/progressive-group-accuses-senate-splinter-group-do/	A progressive advocacy group says eight Democrats in the New York State Senate accepted money from campaign donors who typically support Republicans. A video released by The Creative Resistance targets the Independent Democratic Conference, a faction of Democrats aligned with Republicans instead of the other 23 Democrats in the Senate. "IDC members also get tons of campaign money from real estate, charter school, and health care lobbyists, some of whom are Republicans with connections to Trump," the narrator says. Outside groups often give to the majority party in each chamber. Republicans now hold a majority of 40 members, including IDC members and a Democrat who sits with the Republican conference. The video claims members of the IDC cashed in with donors who also contributed to GOP lawmakers. Is that true? Giving money in the Senate Special interest groups can give money to support candidates in two ways: to candidates directly or to a political party committee. In the State Senate, the Republicans, Democrats and IDC each has its own campaign account. The list of donors The Creative Resistance sent us to support its claim is long. Filings from the state Board of Elections show its claim is accurate -- the IDC did get money from real estate, charter school and health care lobbyists. But so did both Republicans and Democrats. Some health care examples: The Greater New York Hospital Association since 2011 has given $1.3 million to the Senate Republican Campaign Committee, $625,000 to the Senate Democrat Campaign account and $311,000 to the IDC. Individual members of the IDC outpaced Democrats in donations from the association. They collectively received $16,500 since 2011. Individual Democrats collected $6,000 from the organization while Republicans received about $39,000. The Healthcare Association of New York State has given about $810,000 to Republicans between their conference’s campaign account and individual members since 2011. The IDC took a total of about $113,000 from the group. Democrats were given $105,000. Both organizations supported more Democrats than Republicans in the State Assembly, suggesting its money goes to whomever is in power. Charter schools Republicans in the State Legislature are more likely to support legislation that benefits charter schools. That’s reflected through donations they receive from charter school groups. Two of those groups, New Yorkers for Putting Students First and the Coalition for Public Charter Schools, have not given to mainline Senate Democrats since 2011. They gave about $167,000 to the IDC and its members and about $233,000 to Republicans. Eva Moskowitz, the founder of Success Academy Charter Schools, has favored the IDC over Democrats in the Senate. Her political action committee, Great Public Schools, has given about $66,000 to the IDC and its members since 2011. The PAC gave $114,000 to Senate Republicans, while six members of the mainline Democratic conference were given about $38,000 from the group. Real estate Some IDC donors from the real estate industry have ties to President Donald Trump, the video claims. The largest real estate donor on the group’s list is the Real Estate Board of New York, a statewide group that advocates for real estate developers. The Creative Resistance says the group is tied to Trump through his children. Both Eric and Ivanka Trump are members of the board. The board has given slightly more than $1 million to the Senate Republican campaign account and members since 2011. The IDC has received about $480,000 while mainline Democrats were given about $207,000. The IDC's response The IDC responded to the group's claim with its own analysis of major donors from health care, charter school and real estate lobbyists. "An honest review of campaign finance donations of all Democrats in New York illustrates that these same donors contribute to Democrats across the state, and the Senate's minority Democratic conference is no exception," IDC spokesperson Candice Giove said. Our ruling The Creative Resistance said in a video "IDC members also get tons of campaign money from real estate, charter school, and health care lobbyists, some of whom are Republicans with connections to Trump." The IDC and its members do get money from donors in the lobbyists. But so do mainline Democrats, even if it’s less than their IDC colleagues. It's not true the IDC members benefit while Democrats do not. The statement is accurate but needs clarification and additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-07868	Tells President Barack Obama that he also asked former President George W. Bush about how he felt about Americans hating him.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/08/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-tells-obama-he-also-asked-bush-about-/	During a Super Bowl interview on Feb. 6, 2011, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly prefaced a sensitive question to President Barack Obama by saying that he had asked the same question in a previous interview with former President George W. Bush. "I asked this to President Bush when I talked to him a few weeks ago," O’Reilly said to Obama. "Does it disturb you that so many people hate you? No. I mean, it's a serious question." A reader wrote to us to ask whether O’Reilly did ask that question of Bush. So we looked into it. We discovered that O’Reilly was referring to an interview aired on Nov. 11, 2010, when Bush, by then out of office for almost two years, was doing publicity for his memoir, Decision Points. Here’s the exchange between O’Reilly and Bush: O’REILLY: "Okay. But, the people in the press hated you, a lot of them. Why? Why?" BUSH : "I don’t know. You have to ask them. I’m not a hater, and so sometimes it’s hard for me to understand why somebody hates somebody. It could have been because of my policies, maybe they didn’t like my religion. I don’t know. I’m sure there’s a myriad of reasons. That’s what happens when you’re the president. It can either bother you or not bother you. I chose -- O"REILLY: "You ever think about it?" BUSH: "Being hated? No, not really." O’REILLY: "Really? Never?" BUSH: "No. I’m a pretty comfortable guy right now, you know." O’REILLY: "You look it." BUSH: "I really am. I’m honored to have served. I’m glad I served, and I gave it my all, and that’s all you can do at life. I got back -- and this sounds corny to some, I understand, but when I looked in the mirror, I know I didn’t sell my soul for the sake of any short-term politics or popularity. I think that’s important." For the record, here’s how Obama answered O’Reilly: "You know, the truth is, that the people -- and I'm sure previous presidents would say the same thing, whether it was Bush or Clinton or Reagan or anybody. The people who dislike you don't know you. … What they hate is whatever funhouse mirror image of you that's out there. … I think that by the time you get here, you have to have had a pretty thick skin. If you didn't, then you probably wouldn't have gotten here." Technically, O’Reilly asked slightly different questions of each president. To Obama, he asked whether it disturbs him to be hated by "so many" Americans. To Bush, he asked how he felt about being hated by "a lot of" people in the press, and then followed up by asking him more generally if he ever thought about being hated. Still, O’Reilly’s two lines of inquiry are similar enough that we’re giving O’Reilly a True.

pomt-14146	Winning enough pledged delegates is "not impossible."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/02/bernie-sanders/sanders-its-not-impossible-get-enough-delegates-wi/	With less than 20 primaries and caucuses left in the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton has about 290 more pledged delegates than her rival Bernie Sanders. To close that gap and beat her outright, the simple numbers say Sanders has to win about 65 percent of the remaining delegates. The host of CBS News’ Face the Nation, John Dickerson, pressed Sanders on his odds of pulling that off. "To get there, many analysts who look at the pledged delegates just say, it's mathematically impossible," Dickerson said on May 1, 2016. "Are they wrong?" "It's difficult," Sanders said. "It's not impossible." So is it possible? Or impossible? The current pledged delegate count, according to NBC News, is Clinton 1,641, Sanders 1320. If you add in the superdelegates, it’s 2,151 and 1,361. Seasoned primary watcher Alan Abramowitz at Emory University said Sanders had a point -- albeit, a limited one. "Of course it’s mathematically possible for him to win 65 percent of the remaining pledged delegates," Abramowitz said, "But the probability of that actually happening is near zero." One way of gauging Sanders’ odds is to look at how many times he hit the 65-percent mark since the first contests in February. "He has won that large a share of the delegates in a few caucus states," Abramowitz said. "But he has never done it in a primary state other than Vermont, although he came close in New Hampshire." The Sanders campaign sent us their count of pledged delegates. By their reckoning, he needs 64.17 percent of the remaining delegates available. This is pledged delegates, not the super delegates who are free to throw their support behind whomever they want. (The count can vary, but right now, Clinton has about 510 super delegates to Sanders’ 40, according to NBC News.) Under Democratic Party rules, the pledged delegates are divided proportionately to the number of votes each candidate gets. That means there are no winner-take-all contests as there are on the Republican side. Using numbers from the Sanders campaign, we compared the number of contests where Sanders has taken at least 64 percent of the vote to the ones when he didn’t. (We rounded down for fairness.) This table show why analysts give him long odds: Sanders has crested the 64 percent mark on nine occasions, or about 20 percent of the time. For those who say that a 20 percent chance is tough but doable, Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, reminds us that not all primaries are equal. "Sure, Sanders could win California, the biggest prize remaining, but by enough to capture 65 percent of its delegates?" Kondik asked. "Nothing is impossible, but there’s absolutely no reason to think he could do that. Additionally, is Sanders really going to win New Jersey, a mid-Atlantic state, after Clinton generally dominated him in that region? Again, very, very doubtful." Abramowitz said the numbers don’t give Sanders any room for error. "Even if Sanders does better than expected in the remaining states, he would only slightly reduce Clinton’s pledged delegate advantage," he said. Both experts told us that the Democratic Party rule of awarding delegates proportionately makes it very difficult for Sanders to gain much ground. Clinton’s strength among the super delegates, and her overall lead of about 3 million votes, further weigh him down. Our ruling Sanders said it is not impossible for him to surge past Clinton. The experts we reached agreed. Mathematically, it is not impossible. Outside the realm of theory, however, his performance in past contests shows it is far more likely that he won’t hit the winning percentage he needs. The proportional allocation rule works against Sanders, leaving him no room to fall short. Sanders' claim is accurate with a major caveat. We rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d546e1d5-6b47-4c08-962d-2b9643544db1	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-05-02T16:48:57	2016-05-01	['None']
pomt-02436	Even though Chicago has "the most stringent gun laws on the books," it still "has the highest murder rate" in the country.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/02/ron-johnson/us-sen-ron-johnson-links-strict-gun-control-laws-h/	Citing the number of school shootings since Sandy Hook, a woman asked U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson at one of his town hall meetings why he doesn’t support expanded background checks for gun purchases. The Wisconsin Republican responded by connecting strict gun control with a high rate of homicide. "I’ll repeat it: I think we have enough gun laws on the books; we should enforce those," Johnson told his audience in Appleton on Feb. 18, 2014. "But, if you really take a look -- again, look at the facts. The most stringent gun laws on the books are in places like Chicago, (which) has the highest murder rate. "I mean, you see a lot of these -- and let’s face it, they’re all tragedies. I wish there was some magic solution to end those tragedies, prevent them, but there’s not. Some of these tragedies occurred with firearms that were legally obtained. We’ve got, what, 300 million guns on the streets? These tragedies occur in gun-free zones. So, law-abiding citizens abide by those laws; the criminals don’t." Is Johnson right that Chicago has some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, as well as the highest murder rate? And that the two are tied together? We’ll check both parts of his claim. Chicago gun laws, murders Two days after the town hall meeting, we asked Johnson spokesman Patrick McIlheran for evidence to support the senator’s claim. The next day, a blog post titled, "If stricter gun laws were a magic wand, Chicago would be safe," appeared on Johnson’s official Senate web page. McIlheran referred us to the post and said he didn’t have time to discuss Johnson’s claim. In the post, Johnson cited reports from 2013 by National Public Radio and The New York Times in saying that Chicago has some of the nation’s strictest anti-gun laws. Several experts told us there is wide consensus on that point. But Johnson changed the part of his claim about murder in Chicago. Chicago doesn’t have the highest murder rate among U.S. cities -- as in, the number of murders per 100,000 residents -- but rather the highest number of murders, Johnson wrote. The blog cited the latest full-year FBI figures, for 2012. Chicago ranked first among cities in raw numbers, with 500 murders. But its 18.5 murders per 100,000 people didn’t even put the Windy City among the top 10 cities for murder rate. Those figures are for all murders. We also found a January 2013 report by economist Richard Florida that said Chicago had a rate of 11.6 gun murders per 100,000 residents, far below the city with the highest rate, New Orleans, at 62.1. So, on the first part of Johnson’s claim, Chicago has some of the most stringent gun-control laws in the United States, but does not have the highest murder rate. Connecting gun laws, murder rates By citing Chicago in his remarks at the town hall meeting, Johnson’s message was that strict gun-control laws are not associated with low murder rates. In his blog post, Johnson wrote that Chicago has a much higher murder rate than Racine and Kenosha -- much smaller cities in Wisconsin, which the senator said has "more reasonable gun laws." But we found that, on any connection between gun control and murder, the evidence is mixed. For example, had Johnson singled out another heavy-gun-control city -- New York -- in questioning the effectiveness of strict gun control, his audience at the town hall meeting would have gotten an entirely different impression. In 2012, New York’s overall murder rate was 3.8 per 100,000 residents -- far below Chicago’s 18.5. Similarly, the Richard Florida study we noted found that New York's gun murder rate was 4 per 100,000 people and Chicago’s was 11.6 per 100,000. Other views Experts we consulted agreed there is no consensus on whether there is a clear correlation -- much less evidence of cause and effect -- between gun-control laws and a lower murder rate. They said that is particularly true in assessing the relatively few city-level gun control laws, given that most gun laws are put in place at the state and federal level. For one thing, even if a city has strict laws on who can own guns, that doesn't mean it is difficult to bring guns into that city, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. He said one study found that one-third of the guns recovered by police from criminals and crime scenes in Chicago had been purchased in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio or Mississippi -- states that, according to Webster, have the weakest gun laws. "Not surprisingly, it turns out this is a pretty complex thing to study," he said. Webster said that while it is difficult to compare cities, given their differences in demographics and other factors, it is possible to examine how a change in gun restrictions is correlated with gun crime. A study of his released in February 2014, cited by the Think Progress liberal blog, looked at what happened after Missouri in 2007 repealed a law that had required gun buyers in private gun transactions to undergo background checks. It found the repeal "was associated with" an additional 55 to 63 murders per year between 2008 and 2012. At the same time, there have been studies that found the opposite -- a link between fewer gun restrictions and lower murder rates. The findings of a November 2013 study by Quinnipiac University economics professor Mark Gius, which examined data from 1980 through 2009 and was cited by the National Rifle Association, "suggest" that states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murder rates. The results, the study added, "suggest that restrictive concealed weapons laws may cause an increase in gun-related murders at the state level." Guis told us that assessing gun laws and crime is difficult because so many factors, including poverty and drugs, affect crime rates. Moreover, gun murders committed in the heat of passion or in mass shootings are often carried out by people with no criminal record, many of whom would pass a gun background check, he said. "You really can't draw any direct correlation, definitely no cause and effect," Guis said, "especially with city level gun-control laws -- to crime." Our rating Johnson said that even though Chicago has "the most stringent guns laws on the books," it still "has the highest murder rate" in the country. Chicago does have some of the strictest gun-control laws, but is not number one among U.S. cities for the murder rate. Meanwhile, the evidence is mixed on whether stricter gun control is associated with fewer murders.

pomt-03833	"Taxes and fees amount to about 20 percent of a typical $300 round-trip domestic ticket. That’s higher than taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco and firearms."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/17/gary-kelly/southwest-airlines-ceo-says-federal-taxes-flight-a/	On a scale of politically controversial topics, airline tickets might rank near the bottom, perhaps somewhere just above Robert’s Rules of Order and a quorum call. And yet plane tickets have been part of some curious claims taken on by PolitiFact: "Every time you buy an airline ticket, the federal government runs a background check on you" -- PolitiFact Texas: Mostly False You can use food stamps for a plane ticket to "go to Hawaii" -- PolitiFact National: Pants on Fire Now coming down the runway is a claim by Gary Kelly, chief executive officer of Dallas-based Southwest Airlines. Southwest carries the most domestic passengers in the U.S. and the most passengers at Milwaukee’s Mitchell International Airport. Kelly made his statement in a column he wrote for the February 2013 issues of the in-flight magazines of Southwest and of AirTran Airways, which Southwest acquired in 2011. "Taxes and fees amount to about 20 percent of a typical $300 round-trip domestic ticket," he stated. "That’s higher than taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco and firearms." With spring break around the corner, and alcohol, tobacco and firearms always in season, let’s see if Kelly’s claim takes flight. Cost of an airline ticket Kelly’s opinion column focused on federal taxes on airline tickets and other products. His source for the taxes on an airline ticket is Airlines for America, the trade group that advocates for the airline industry. It spent $6.37 million in federal lobbying in 2012, according to the nonpartisan OpenSecrets.org. In December 2012, Airlines for America announced details of a campaign it would undertake in 2013 to persuade lawmakers to reduce federal taxes on airlines and take other steps to help the industry. Just how high are those taxes? Southwest Airlines spokesman Brad Hawkins used figures provided by Airlines for America to give a breakdown of the four major federal taxes and fees on a ticket with a base price of $300. His example includes one connecting flight each way -- in other words, a ticket that includes two flights on the departure segment of the trip and two flights on the return. Type of tax Amount Total Excise tax 7.5% x $300 $22.50 Segment fee $3.90 x 4 segments $15.60 Passenger facility charge $4.50 x 4 segments $18 TSA ("Sept. 11th") fee $2.50 x 4 segments $10 Grand total $66.10 Based on Hawkins’ calculations, the $66.10 equals 22 percent of the cost of the $300 ticket, exceeding the 20 percent that Kelly claimed. As for the size of the taxes and fees, we found a Federal Aviation Administration document confirming the excise tax and segment fee amounts; they help fund the FAA, which coordinates air traffic control and other aspects of the aviation system. (An excise tax is somewhat like a sales tax, in that it is paid on a purchase, but it’s often included in the purchase price.) Another FAA document confirms the passenger facility charge, which is collected by public agencies that run commercial airports and is used for FAA-approved projects at the airports. And a Transportation Security Administration document confirms the Sept. 11 fee, which helps fund the TSA. We ran Kelly’s statement and his itinerary by Joakim Karlsson, a researcher with the Airline Ticket Tax Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the project studies ticket taxes and user fees added directly to airline tickets. He called Kelly’s statement "mathematically correct, but fundamentally misleading." Karlsson noted that fares are usually quoted with taxes and fees included. So, a $300 ticket would include a base fare of about $239. Karlsson calculated that would trigger $61 in taxes and fees, which would still amount to 20 percent of the ticket cost, the same amount Kelly claimed. But more importantly, Karlsson said, the sample ticket that Kelly uses is not typical: The typical domestic flight in the U.S. costs $418 (as of 2011), not $300. Two-thirds of all domestic tickets sold do not include connecting flights, but rather are non-stop, so they incur fewer federal fees. So, a $418 non-stop ticket would include $54 in taxes and fees, or just under 15 percent of the total. (The taxes and fees in Kelly’s $300 ticket example, if the trip were non-stop, also would equal just under 15 percent.) That means the first part of Kelly’s claim is accurate, but leaves out important details. Taxes and fees on other products As for the second part of Kelly’s statement, the Southwest Airlines spokesman cited a 2011 opinion column in The Wall Street Journal by the chief executive officer of Airlines for America, the airlines trade group. The column argued that the taxes paid by airlines are at the "same excessive levels" as "sin" taxes imposed on alcohol, tobacco and gambling. But the column provided no figures to show how the various tax rates compare. We found the following figures from the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, a division of the Department of Treasury. They represent only the federal taxes on these products. Product Tax Beer 5 cents per 12-ounce can Wine 21 cents per 750-milliliter bottle Distilled spirits $2.14 (at 80 proof) per 750-milliliter bottle Cigarettes $1.01 per 20 cigarettes Firearms 10%-11% of sale price Some brands of beer cost more than others, some wine costs more in one part of the country than another, buying in bulk costs less, etc. But, to consider some examples, if a: Six-pack of beer costs $6 at the store, 30 cents of that -- or 5 percent -- would be the federal tax. Bottle of wine costs $8, the 21-cent tax amounts to 2.6 percent. Bottle of 80-proof tequila costs $15, the tax is 14.3 percent. Pack of cigarettes costs $9, the tax would represent 11 percent of the cost; although if the pack cost $6, the tax would amount to nearly 17 percent of the cost. None of this takes into account state and local taxes on the various products, but Kelly’s claim focuses on federal taxes. So, the tax rate on an airline ticket -- whether it’s 20 percent, as in the example Kelly cited, or the more typical 15 percent as cited by the MIT program -- is generally higher than the federal tax rates on the other products Kelly cited. One might argue that taxes and fees on airline tickets, which help fund aviation operations, are fundamentally different from "sin" taxes on things like cigarettes, which are meant to hold down consumption. But that’s not an argument central to this claim. Our rating Kelly said: "Taxes and fees amount to about 20 percent of a typical $300 round-trip domestic ticket. That’s higher than taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco and firearms." The first part of the claim is technically accurate, but misleading, given that the tax rate on a typical flight -- which costs more than $300 and doesn’t include connecting flights -- is 15 percent. The second part of the claim, although it doesn’t take into account price variations on various products, appears generally accurate. On balance, since the thrust of the claim was which had more taxes and which had less, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Gary Kelly	None	None	None	2013-03-17T09:00:00	2013-02-01	['None']
pomt-01466	Says U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland "voted to keep the shutdown going."	true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/01/gwen-graham/steve-southerland-voted-extend-2013-government-shu/	After a barrage of fighting words from incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland, Democratic congressional hopeful Gwen Graham has come back swinging in the tight race to represent a northern Florida district. First, Southerland called Graham a "Washington lobbyist," an attack that focused on what the just-out-of-law-school attorney was doing 25 years ago. We ruled that claim Mostly False. Now the daughter of Bob Graham, the former governor and U.S. senator, has dug into the first-term congressman’s voting record and accused him of being obstructionist. "Believe me, I can handle Congressman Southerland’s campaign of lies and put-downs," Graham said in a recent television commercial. "But his vote for the government shutdown? Now, that’s a problem. He cost taxpayers $24 billion. His shutdown hurt businesses and families, seniors and even our veterans. And when both parties finally got together to fix it, Congressman Southerland voted to keep the shutdown going." Graham’s mention of the shutdown refers to the battle between Oct. 1, 2013, and Oct. 16, 2013, when congressional Republicans refused to fund President Barack Obama’s health care law and Obama refused to sign spending bills unless they included funding for the law. With the two sides in deadlock for more than two weeks, annual spending bills did not move through Congress and to the president’s desk. Without money to fund its operations, the federal government reduced its activities to those of protecting lives and property; many federal workers were furloughed, and many federal services were dormant. Democrats have tried to blame the GOP for the shutdown, with some success. But is Graham correct that Southerland tried to keep the unpopular gridlock going even when his Capitol Hill cohorts tried to compromise? The short answer: Basically, yes. Shutdown showdown During the runup to the shutdown, the GOP-led House, stacked with tea party-backed junior representatives like Southerland, strategized to "defund Obamacare" -- that is, not pass any spending bill that gave money for the president’s signature health care legislation. The battle was joined in earnest on Sept. 20, when the House voted, 230-189, to raise the nation’s $16.7 trillion debt limit only if Affordable Care Act funding was stripped out of the spending bill. Southerland released a statement that day reading, "I do not want to see a government shutdown." He called the vote "a decisive step forward in our fight to ensure that the federal government is properly funded" while ensuring "our nation’s credit rating will be protected, while moving one step closer to a permanent delay and dismantling of government-run health care." He then went on to vote for three House bills stripped of Obamacare funding prior to Oct. 1, which his campaign manager Luke Strickland said was proof Southerland "didn't support and didn't vote for the government shutdown." It was well-known that the Democratic-held Senate would not accept such a bill sent from the House, and the bills went nowhere. Negotiations broke down and on Sept. 30, the federal government was shuttered. The House made several attempts to pass spending measures with similar provisions against Obamacare, but they continued to get bounced by the Senate. (Southerland, like most of his Republican colleagues, repeatedly approved these attempts.) Finally, after 16 days, the Senate passed a spending bill that raised the debt ceiling and funded the government through Jan. 15, 2014, by a bipartisan vote of 81-18. (Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., was one of the Republican’s in the nay column; when he tried to say he voted to fully fund the government, we ruled the claim Mostly False.) The House soon relented, voting 285-144 for H.R. 2775, with 87 Republicans in support. But the key to checking Graham’s claim is that Southerland did not cross the aisle. Had enough additional Republicans joined him in voting no, the shutdown would have continued. Southerland’s campaign manager noted that while the lawmaker voted for several measures to fund essential services and to create the working group that focused on finding a compromise, his convictions led him to vote against the bipartisan bill that ended the stalemate. "After all of the uncertainty caused by the shutdown, Steve believed we needed a long-term solution that addressed the root causes of the crisis, not another stopgap that could have put us right back in the same boat months down the road," Strickland told PolitiFact Florida. It’s not like Southerland’s ashamed of his anti-Obamacare position. His online House profile boasts that he has voted to "to repeal, replace, and defund Obamacare over forty times." He did speak about the vote after H.R. 2775 passed and the government reopened. He said he "fought tooth and nail from day one to avert a shutdown" and blamed the Senate for rejecting the House spending bills. Southerland said the end result wasn’t something he could stomach, but he didn’t mention the looming specter of default that overshadowed the faceoff. "I had no choice but to oppose (Senate Majority Leader Harry) Reid’s bill because it provides short-term spending without addressing the long-term drivers of this shutdown, including an exploding national debt and glaring inequalities under the president’s health care law," Southerland said. (For the record, the bill was hammered out by Reid, a Nevada Democrat, and the Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.) "I simply can’t justify to my constituents a system where corporations and labor unions deserve a one-year compliance delay and government officials get special premium subsidies while average American families receive neither," Southerland continued. "I hope both parties in Washington learned a lesson from this shutdown and we get serious about addressing these issues before again bringing the nation to the brink." Our ruling Graham said Southerland "voted to keep the shutdown going." The ad refers to an Oct. 16, 2013, no vote Southerland cast against a bipartisan Senate bill that funded the government and ended the shutdown. By the time it reached the House floor, it was clear to lawmakers that their vote would effectively be deciding whether to end the shutdown or not. If more Republicans had joined Southerland in voting no, the shutdown would have continued. Regardless of Southerland’s personal feelings about a shutdown, Graham is focusing her attack on his vote -- and his vote was a clear "no" to ending the shutdown. We rate the claim True.

pomt-07381	"At Texas A&M University, only 49 out of 3,000 faculty members brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead over the past five years."	false	/texas/statements/2011/may/04/dick-armey/dick-armey-says-49-texas-sam-university-faculty-ha/	In an opinion-page article, a former U.S. House majority leader from Texas poked at Texas A&M University while urging greater rewards for professors who attract research dollars. In the April 17 Houston Chronicle, Dick Armey wrote: "The incentives in our higher education system should attract the best professors and researchers in the world and provide our students the best education possible. Let's start by allowing researchers to keep up to 90 percent of the research dollars they generate instead of the 50 percent that is typically the limit today. Disclosing the salaries of tenured professors would be another useful reform, along with how many students they teach and how many funded research dollars they bring in." His A&M punchline: "At Texas A&M University, only 49 out of 3,000 faculty members brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead over the past five years." Well, gig us. Is that count correct? To our request for back-up, FreedomWorks spokesman Adam Brandon said by email that the group is writing a detailed report making the point that "great researchers should be rewarded for bringing in lots of research dollars, rather than having them siphoned off to support less productive researchers." Armey chairs FreedomWorks, which says it mobilizes people for lower taxes, less government and more freedom. Brandon’s reply continued: "The easiest back-of-the-envelope calculation might be to assume that if a researcher brought in more funding than his salary, he would have ‘paid for himself.’ Incrementally this might be true, but neglects the full costs of running the university. To do a full cost analysis, you have to burden the compensation with overhead." Brandon said the latest available information, covering 2008, comes from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, which describes itself as a system of interrelated surveys conducted annually by the federal government involving every college, university, and technical and vocational institution that participates in federal student financial aid programs. Brandon said the data is the "foundation for (Armey’s) analysis that only 49 (A&M) researchers paid for themselves." Brandon said data drawn from that system show that for every $1 spent on faculty salaries, the university expended money on overhead. That is, Brandon said, each dollar of research "creates some additional costs elsewhere in the university." He said Armey calculated that each $1 of salary, plus 25 percent to represent the cost of benefits, must bear $2.71 of overhead. "Running these calculations, we found that over a five-year period, only 49 researchers paid for themselves." We unsuccessfully sought a detailed breakdown of university spending from Armey supporting his claim. Separately, an online search led us to articles published in September by the Bryan-College Station Eagle on a report prepared by the Texas A&M University System on the costs and contributions of faculty members in 2008-09. As summarized in a Sept. 15 news article, the study isolated "what a faculty member generates by teaching -- tuition paid by students and formula funding by the state based on weighted semester credit hours -- and subtracts from that the faculty member's salary and estimated cost of benefits. It doesn't take research dollars generated into account," the newspaper reported, though such information appears in an adjacent column. In a memo prefacing the detailed breakdown, the chancellor of the A&M system, Michael McKinney, said it shows the "faculty at each university generate revenue in excess of their payroll costs. University literally means totality," the memo says. "Our faculties work together, some teaching many undergraduates, some teaching fewer graduate students and some providing new knowledge through research." Once issued, the report prompted criticisms across A&M’s flagship campus, according to the Eagle. Some complained the report’s faculty research funding tallies were off and some said salaries were overstated. The paper quoted Jorge Vanegas, dean of the College of Architecture, saying the metric favors faculty who teach more without accounting for Texas A&M’s function as a research university. "When numbers are taken out of their full context and they feed into misconceptions or explicit lack of recognition of what the full spectrum of academia should be, it causes a demoralizing effect on faculty," Vanegas said. The Eagle reported that the A&M system removed the report from the Internet as a spokesman said the information on externally funded research continued to be refined. A few days later, the president at the College Station campus, R. Bowen Loftin, emailed faculty stating the report results wouldl not be used to "assess the overall productivity of an individual faculty member, and it certainly does not speak to the quality of that productivity," the newspaper reported. We obtained a copy of the report through an open-records’ request. Of interest: One column in its charts shows the difference between total funds generated by each faculty member and their salary costs. We quickly counted more than 49 faculty members credited with generating more than they cost in the studied year, in just the first three of dozens of the university’s academic departments. Specifically, the report lists 21 faculty in Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication; 17 in Agricultural Economics; and 18 in Animal Science--56 total--as net income generators. In those departments, 45 teachers ran in the red, so to speak, according to the report. In an interview, system spokesman Jason Cook confirmed that the study did not try to assign a cost for each teacher's overhead. "I don't know how we could do that," he said. What about Armey’s statement that only 49 A&M faculty members brought in enough money to pay for their salaries and overhead the past five years? Cook emailed us: "We don't know how" Armey's number was determined. Cook later said that the IPED research cited by FreedomWorks is useful to compare A&M to other institutions, but cannot be used to pinpoint how many faculty members earn their keep. Upshot: Without access to Armey’s data, we couldn’t plumb his methodology. Meantime, our spot-check of Texas A&M’s recent study of faculty costs, which some critics said undercounted faculty contributions, suggests that way more than 49 faculty members accounted for more than they cost in 2008-09.

pomt-08413	Pat Toomey "still supports privatizing Social Security."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/20/joe-sestak/joe-sestak-says-pat-toomey-still-supports-privatiz/	In what's becoming a close Pennsylvania Senate race, Democratic Rep. Joe Sestak is hammering former Republican Rep. Pat Toomey over Social Security. Here's an ad unveiled Oct. 11, 2010. "The stock market crash," a narrator somberly intones, as video and audio clips of the 2008 Wall Street tumble stream by. "If Social Security had been privatized, seniors would have seen their retirement wiped out." (Video shows four images of seniors.) "Congressman Pat Toomey still supports privatizing Social Security. See, Toomey has represented Wall Street his entire life, so Toomey puts Wall Street profits ahead of protecting Pennsylvania seniors." (Video shows images of Toomey and newspaper clips referring to his stance on privatizing Social Security.) We wondered how accurate Sestak's ad was, since it echoed other Democratic ads on Social Security that we've rated either Barely True or Half True. First, a little background on the idea of privatizing Social Security. Conservatives have long embraced the idea of turning Social Security as we know it -- in which younger workers' payroll taxes fund retired Americans' monthly payments -- into a system where workers may invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement. The upside, supporters argue, is that retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given the historical rates of return from private investments. Of course, critics note a major downside -- the possibility of loss. Social Security may be invested more conservatively than some private investments, but that protects retirees from market losses. And, because it's a legal entitlement, retirees can count on Social Security, unless the law is changed. While Republicans have emphasized possible gains from personal investing, many Democrats have focused on potential losses, leading many Republicans to distance themselves from the word they once used to describe the idea -- "privatization." Understanding that many seniors have deep concerns about changing the way Social Security works -- and knowing that seniors turn out to vote in comparatively high numbers -- few Republican politicians today advocate a full-blown privatization of Social Security. Rather, those who take up the issue at all propose a gradual transition in which current Social Security beneficiaries and those within a decade or so of entering the program will undergo no changes. Instead, the changes made would only affect those a decade or more away from retirement, and in most proposals, these younger workers would only divert a portion of their payroll taxes to private accounts (rather than 100 percent in the purest version) and would do so on a voluntary basis (instead of the shift being mandatory). This model is pretty close to what Toomey said represents his current view during a recent meeting with the editorial board of the Scranton Times-Tribune. "Under Mr. Toomey's proposal, the government would guarantee the Social Security benefits of people currently at or approaching retirement age," wrote staff writer Borys Krawczeniuk in his Oct. 8 report on the meeting. "'Any change for those folks would be outrageous and unreasonable. Those people who have worked a lifetime paying into a system with a promised set of benefits need to get what they were promised,' Mr. Toomey said. 'But if we're going to be honest about it, we know the program can't continue in its current form.'" The article added that Toomey's plan would allow "younger workers to voluntarily divert a portion of their Social Security payroll tax into private savings accounts they would control and invest any way they want. A young worker who did not want to do that could stay with the current system of a guaranteed benefit." So, back to the ad. We see two areas worth a closer look. • Is it "privatization" if it's partial, voluntary privatization? In our previous analyses, we have been critical of ads that fudge the difference. This one doesn't explicitly say that Toomey wants to privatize the whole program, but it doesn't disabuse viewers of that notion either. • Does the ad go too far in directing its message toward seniors, even though Toomey's plan specifically exempts them from any changes? As we've noted in an earlier fact-check of the Sestak-Toomey race, focusing on seniors makes good sense in Pennsylvania: It's the fourth oldest state in the union, with 15.5 percent of its residents over 65, trailing only Florida, West Virginia and Maine. Sestak's ad uses four images of senior citizens, and it specifically cites older Americans in its closing line by saying that "Toomey puts Wall Street profits ahead of protecting Pennsylvania seniors." Yet Toomey makes a point of saying that his plan won't affect those currently in Social Security or those entering the program in the next few years. He even said that any effort to change the rules for older Americans would be "outrageous" and "unreasonable." So wouldn't that qualify as misleading? Not so fast, says the Sestak camp. They argue that even though the seniors are nominally protected by Toomey's pledge, they wouldn't be kept safe in reality. When you drain Social Security revenue by allowing younger workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes privately, you increase the fiscal pressure on Social Security in its role delivering benefits to current retirees. Since retirees are still promised full benefits under the Toomey plan, the revenue shortfall will eventually have to be made up somehow, whether it's through new taxes or increased borrowing -- or reduced benefits. If benefits are to be reduced, then even retirees supposedly protected under Toomey's plan could suffer. We ran this line of thinking by a variety of policy experts. They agreed that there's a legitimate policy concern with the transition to a partially privatized system, but they added that it may not provide full justification for the ad's focus on today's seniors. For one thing, you could just as easily make the argument that current benefit levels are under fiscal threat due to demographic trends, yet the ad doesn't acknowledge that risk. In addition, the amount of immediate fiscal pressure will ultimately depend on how big a portion of their payroll taxes participants are allowed to invest privately, and whether the option proves widely popular or not. Finally, Social Security has a trust fund that is predicted to remain solvent through 2037, meaning that revenue replenishment might not have to take place immediately. This latter fact is relevant in judging the ad's atmospherics, because if the replenishment is delayed long enough, no one who's a senior today -- or who's going to be one any time soon -- would face the possibility of a cut in retirement benefits. And that would undercut the ad's focus on seniors. Paul Van de Water of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities does note that seniors may oppose even a partial privatization because they want their grandchildren to have a solid Social Security benefit when they reach retirement. "Since we don’t have pictures of what (their grandchildren) will look like 30 or 40 years from now, I don’t think that it’s misleading to use pictures of today’s elderly to illustrate the point," he said. We see his argument, but we still think the ad overplays its hand. The ad is correct that Toomey supports a type of privatization -- in fact, he's been quite open about it -- but that privatization proposal is limited and optional. The Toomey plan also wouldn't directly affect today's seniors, and it may or may not affect any of today's seniors who are still alive years down the road. This clashes with the ad's visuals, which seem directly targeted at older voters, not younger ones. On balance, we rate the ad Half True.

pomt-01748	Says U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst does not support "a national minimum wage."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/01/bruce-braley/iowa-senate-candidate-rep-bruce-braley-says-joni-e/	A new ad from Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Bruce Braley focuses on the minimum wage as part of his campaign’s effort to paint Ernst as "too extreme" for Iowa. It uses video and audio clips of Ernst speaking at primary debates and in interviews as evidence for the claim that she does not "think there should be a national minimum wage." According to the most recent polls, Ernst and Braley are nearly tied. We wanted to know if this latest attack ad was accurate: Does Ernst oppose a national minimum wage? This isn’t the first attack on Ernst for her position on the minimum wage. In a June ad, the Iowa Democratic Party accused Ernst of flip-flopping on the issue. We decided to take a look back at Ernst’s public statements and positions on the minimum wage, but it can get confusing. So we compiled a timeline to see if her views changed. January 2014 On Jan. 9, 2014 Braley released a report on minimum wage that suggested raising the national figure to $10.10 an hour. Ernst disagreed. "I believe that businesses will do what is best for their business," she said in an interview the same day. "I don’t know that the government needs to be stepping in and telling them this is what you will do." February 2014 Ernst’s opposition to the federal government’s role in raising a minimum wage continued. "Government and government-mandated wage increases are not the solution," she said, as reported in a Quad-City Times story. March 2014 At a candidate forum held by the National Federation of Independent Business on March 18, 2014, Ernst said this: "I do believe it is best left up to the states. Our state economies are much different from state to state, so I don’t believe the federal government should be involved in setting the minimum wage." Ernst also talked about the great opportunity she had working a minimum wage job as a biscuit maker at Hardee’s. "I think $7.25 is appropriate for Iowa," she concluded. April 2014 In an April debate Ernst said she would not raise Iowa’s minimum wage. She argued that minimum wage jobs were "introductory level" positions and eventually workers could progress into better paying jobs as they acquired more skills. June 2014 Ernst appeared on Iowa Public Radio for a candidate profile on June 1, 2014. When asked about increasing the minimum wage, Ernst responded with a familiar line. "I do not support a federal minimum wage. Every state has a different economy, different cost of living. I don’t believe that’s the role of the federal government," she said. But she seemed to soften that position in late June. After Ernst won the Republican primary she suggested the minimum wage should be left as it is but not raised. "I never called for the abolishment of it. Never," Ernst said to U.S. News and World Report on June 23, 2014. "I’m saying I don’t support a $10.10 minimum wage. This is somewhat contradictory as her earlier comments suggested she saw no role for the federal government in setting the minimum wage. When we asked about it, Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel said Ernst believes that decisions about the minimum wage should be made "locally, not in Washington." Ernst believes that "Iowans know what’s best for Iowa and that’s where these decisions belong -- on the state level." July 2014 PolitiFact asked the Ernst campaign on July 31, 2014, about Ernst's position on the minimum wage. PolitiFact: "Does she believe that the federal government should play any role at all in deciding the minimum wage? Or should it be left up to the states entirely?" Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel: "While in college Joni worked for minimum wage at Hardee’s and believes the minimum wage is a safety net. Joni does not believe in Washington’s one size fits all approach; that’s why any decision pertaining to the minimum wage rate going forward needs to be decided locally, not in Washington. What’s right for New York or California, is not necessarily right for Iowa." PolitiFact: "In a couple of debates and interviews she refers to the minimum wage as a 'safety net.' What exactly does she mean by that?" Hamel: "The baseline minimum wage that has been set." Our ruling Braley said that Ernst does not support a "national minimum wage." Ernst's public statements have been confusing at times, but overall, she has said repeatedly that states should decide the minimum wage, not the federal government. She's also called the minimum wage a "safety net," and her campaign told us that by that she means the current baseline minimum wage. Overall, we rate Braley's statement Mostly True.

pomt-00015	Mexico is providing professional charter buses for the migrant caravan.	half-true	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/08/blog-posting/bus-caravan-needs-additional-context/	A story shared on Facebook claims that the Mexican government is helping the migrant caravan by paying for professional charter buses to help leapfrog the group closer to the United States border. The story was posted by the Red State, a conservative political blog, on Oct. 30 and cites a Fox News journalist, who reported from Mexico. The broadcast showed footage of buses lined up as hundreds of Central American migrants waited to board. The caravan is one of three trekking through Mexico and includes thousands of people. The Red State story said that the growing migrant caravan headed toward the U.S. border was followed by "disturbing reports of the migrants getting state-funded help from Mexico." This report was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found the story was partially accurate, but lacked some essential details. The broadcast In the Oct. 30 broadcast, Fox News reporter Griff Jenkins said it was the first time he had seen "an organized bus operation from the state of Oaxaca actually getting volunteer buses to put people on them and take them to their next location." He said the buses were intended for women and children, but many fathers and husbands didn’t want to be separated from their families. Jenkins also said that while the Mexican police had tried to dissuade the caravan from crossing the Guatemala-Mexican border in mid October, it seems "at least Mexican towns are really assisting them to make their way now." An AZ Central story from the same day reported that migrants began arriving in Oaxaca that morning from Santiago Niltepec, a town about 30 miles to the south. For the first time, the outlet reported, buses were "used to transport women and children." Several images captured by the Associated Press also show families and children on buses, with reporting that the rides were donated to help some families get to the next destination. The images were taken the morning of Oct. 30 in the Niltepec, Oaxaca state. It is not known who paid for the donated rides. It isn’t clear if those were the same buses that Jenkins saw, but the time, date and region matches multiple reports that said families took donated buses to get to their next destination. An offer, and then a reversal A few days later, on Nov. 2, a Mexican governor offered to help assist the caravan with buses, The Associated Press reported. Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes announced in a video that authorities in the state would provide humanitarian assistance as well as buses to leapfrog them to the country’s capital. But almost immediately after, Yunes withdrew the offer in a second video, saying that because Mexico City’s water system was undergoing maintenance, it would not be correct to send the migrants there. However, reports say that the scheduled maintenance had been known for some time. Most of the migrants were reported to have continued on foot instead, and reached the Mexican capital over the weekend. Our ruling It is unclear whether the buses Fox News saw and reported on were the work of the Mexican federal government, but other reports from the same day and region said buses were donated for some migrant families to use to get to their next destination. At one point, a Mexican governor did make an offer to transport migrants by bus to Mexico City, the group’s next stop at the time. However, he withdrew that plan almost immediately thereafter. The story has some basis, but it doesn’t provide readers with all the details or mention that multiple buses were donated. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07471	Multnomah County has faced "11 straight years" of cuts	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/16/jeff-cogen/has-multnomah-county-had-cut-11-straight-years/	Multnomah County Chairman Jeff Cogen is in the midst of proposing his first real budget, after succeeding Ted Wheeler last year. For the chairman’s first state of the county speech in February, he described the current budget picture as challenging. "This year we face yet another multimillion-dollar budget deficit … it’s the 11th straight year of cuts at Multnomah County. That’s right: 11 straight years of cuts. Our broken tax system means that in good years we cut services and in bad years we slash them." (from prepared remarks) We believe the chairman when he says the county has faced some pretty lean years, especially with two recessions within the last decade. But did the county really face 11 straight years of cuts? The statement needed checking out. First, a little background. The county is responsible for some public safety, library, public health and human services. One third of the county’s total budget is the general fund, the bulk of which comes from property taxes, and then business taxes, car rental taxes, and so on. Because property tax rates are capped annually at 3 percent, while inflation, personnel and other costs are more like 4 percent or 5 percent (according to the county), budgeting can be rough going. Now for the budget numbers, which go back about a decade. The first column lists general fund dollars; it includes the temporary county income tax for fiscal years 2004-06, about $32 million a year, but not the portion that went toward public schools. The figures are unadjusted for inflation. The second column shows ongoing and one-time money, adjusted for inflation, and excluding the temporary income tax. The third column shows general fund dollars adjusted for inflation but excluding one-time money. (The analyst didn’t go all the way back.) All three sets come from the county. General fund, unadjusted for inflation Adjusted for inflation, includes ongoing and some one-time dollars Adjusted for inflation, excludes one-time dollars FY 2003 $304 $342.2 -- FY 2004 $306.2 $310.5 -- FY 2005 $310.1 $304.2 -- FY 2006 $333.4 $306.4 -- FY 2007 $351.7 $354.5 $324.8 FY 2008 $363.6 $358.7 $341.3 FY 2009 $407.6 $381.4 $350.1 FY 2010 $380 $340.1 $335.5 FY 2011 $392 $349.8 $337.2 FY 2012* based on March forecast $407.9 $366.2 (unadjusted for inflation) $352.8 (unadjusted for inflation) You can see that the numbers have climbed steadily since 2006, no matter which column you pick, with the exception of fiscal year 2010, which saw a significant dip. How then does the county justify the claim that it’s had 11 straight years of cuts? Well, it depends on how you think of "cuts." People understand the concept of a pay cut: You have less money to spend or save. The county, though, has more money to spend so it hasn’t faced 11 straight years of that sort of cut. But the county considers reducing services a cut. It rolls back services if there is a gap between projected ongoing revenue and projected ongoing expenses. Projected expenses means the money needed to maintain current service levels. So even though the actual dollar amount available for FY 2012 is more than for FY 2011, the county budget people say they are facing cuts, either to direct services or to staff. The March revenue forecast shows a projected $4.4 million gap between revenues and expenditures -- or a difference of a little more than 1 percent -- in the operating budget for fiscal year 2012, which starts July 1. No doubt the county has had to make cuts over the years, maybe in some department every single year, but Multnomah County also has added programs, has expanded programs and has paid more for raises, health insurance and cost-of-living increases for much of the past decade. Cogen strenuously disagrees with our definition. He said most people see cuts not in terms of fewer dollars, but fewer services. Having more money does not mean the county avoids service cuts, he argues, mainly because the general cost of doing business goes up. He even pointed to language in stories in The Oregonian that say K-12 schools will get $80 million more over the next two years, but that won’t be enough to avert teacher layoffs or shorter school years. (That’s because educators say they need $1 billion more to cover inflation and student enrollment increases.) The bottom line for PolitiFact Oregon? Multnomah County has consistently received more money in the general fund with few exceptions. We don’t think of that as more than a decade of cuts. We believe Cogen when he says he takes his integrity seriously. And we recognize that the county is restricted by the cap on property taxes. But we can’t agree with the chairman’s statement that the county has had 11 years of cuts. The statement may be accurate, in that there were service cuts, but it leaves out important details, such as the rising dollars in its budget. We rate this Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-02519	"The median net worth of American households hasn't changed much over the past decades, it's about $20,000 ... but Congress' average median net worth has ballooned, more than doubled."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/11/ari-melber/msnbcs-melber-congressional-wealth-climbed-while-m/	If Democrats have their way, the growing gap between the wealthy and everyone else will play a major role in the 2014 elections. The trend certainly raises questions about government policies, but it also has implications for the make-up of our government itself. In an interview with retiring U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., MSNBC host Ari Melber noted the increasing affluence within the halls of Congress. "The median net worth of American households hasn't changed much over the past decades, it's about $20,000," Melber said. "But Congress' average median net worth has ballooned, more than doubled." As Melber spoke, a chart comparing 1984 and 2009 appeared on the screen. The column showing the median household net worth was about the same in both years. But the column for members of Congress started out tall and became much taller. Melber cited a Washington Post article that brought together two sets of information. One was a detailed survey of the financial status of Americans collected by University of Michigan researchers. The other was the disclosure forms from members of Congress. In constant dollars, the net worth in Congress went from $280,000 to $725,000. Meanwhile, the corresponding figures for the median American household went from $20,600 to $20,500. It’s important to note that these numbers don’t look at net worth the way most analysts use that term. The Washington Post analysis excluded the value of peoples’ homes. And home values significantly boost people’s net worths, said Richard Fry, a senior economist with the Pew Research Center. "The total median wealth of American households, if you include the home, was not flat since 1984," Fry said. "There was a big run up house prices over the 25 years." But the Post had a reason for excluding this real estate in their analysis: Members of Congress don’t have to disclose the value of their homes. Cutting it out of the tally for regular Americans allowed the newspaper to compare apples to apples. MSNBC host Melber said if the network decides to quote somebody else’s work, they stick to what was originally reported. "We avoid adding data to the results or findings," Melber said. The downside of this approach is it left MSNBC viewers with the misleading impression that Americans have far fewer assets than they actually do. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a more accurate figure today for all Americans, including home value, is a bit under $69,000. (Members of Congress would have higher net worths, too, using this calculation.) So while both numbers are higher, Melber’s point about the widening gap between the wealth of typical Americans and their elected representatives in Washington is spot on. The gap has grown because as investments, real estate and Wall Street have followed very different trajectories. To put it simply, stocks and other financial investments have shot up, while real estate has not done nearly as well. By one analysis, home prices fell 31 percent from 2005 to 2011. In the same period, the S&P 500 delivered a 13 percent return. Who tends to have more money in stocks and such? Wealthy people. And what’s the profile of our elected officials in Washington? Affluent. More than 300 members are in the millionaires club, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. For John Samples, director of the Center for Representative Government at the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington, the impact on net worth over time is predictable. "Higher net worth individuals tend to be more invested in capital markets, which have done well since 2008 and indeed, over the long term," Samples said. According to the Census Bureau, nearly two-thirds of households with a net worth over $500,000 owned stocks or mutual funds, compared to about 10 percent of all other households. In 2012, the median net worth in Congress was over a million dollars, putting members squarely in the high-end group. As for why Congress might have so many members with a high net worth, Sarah Bryner, an analyst with the Center for Responsive Politics, said there is no one answer. A hypothesis? It’s not easy to run for office unless you’re wealthy. "If I work for somebody else, I can't tell that person I will need a year and a half off to run for office," Bryner said. "They would laugh at you. But if I own a law firm, then I do have the flexibility to take off large chunks of time to go fundraising." Our ruling MSNBC’s Melber said that the median net worth of Americans has barely changed since 1984 while it has skyrocketed for members of Congress. Experts confirmed that the real and growing gap between the typical American and a member of Congress is on the order described by Melber. However, when Melber said that the median net worth of American households is about $20,500, he failed to note that the figure relied on a peculiar definition of net worth that omitted the value of people's homes. That omission left viewers with a signficant misunderstanding of the real number. Because of that, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-09298	"The vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country.''	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/22/barack-obama/obama-campaign-financed-large-donors-too/	New financial regulations are pending in Congress, but both political parties get a lot of campaign contributions from the people they intend to regulate -- Wall Street. The financial sector donates millions to both Republican and Democratic candidates. And during the last couple of election cycles, Democrats have outstripped Republicans, who have traditionally been thought of as more business-friendly. Those political realities have made for interesting dynamics as the negotiations on financial regulation continue. President Barack Obama answered questions on this topic in an interview with CNBC's John Harwood on April 21, 2010. "In the 2008 campaign, you got a lot of money, about $1 million from employees of Goldman Sachs," Harwood said. "Your former White House counsel Greg Craig is apparently going to represent Goldman Sachs. In light of this case, do either of those things embarrass you?" "No," Obama said. "First of all, I got a lot of money from a lot of people. And the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country. And moreover, anybody who gave me money during the course of my campaign knew that I was on record again in 2007, and 2008, pushing very strongly that we needed to reform how Wall Street did business. And so, nobody should be surprised in the position that I'm taking now because it is one that I was very clear about in the course of the campaign." What jumped out at us in this exchange was Obama's statement, "the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country." We've seen that statement repeated elsewhere, but the evidence doesn't back it up. Campaign contributions are public record, so there's verifiable data on how much political candidates receive and who gives it to them. Obama did raise a lot of money from small donations collected over the Internet, and several groups have analyzed the information to determine how much that was. While Obama got more money from small donors than his opponents, they did not account for the majority of his funds. We're setting the bar for a small donor as someone who gives $200 or less. The Federal Election Commission rules say that someone who gives this amount does not need to publicly disclose their name, address, occupation and employer. In the general election, Obama got about 34 percent of his individual donations from small donors, people who gave $200 or less, according to a report from the Campaign Finance Institute. Another 23 percent of donations came from people who gave between $201 and $999, and another 42 percent from people who gave $1,000 or more. His numbers for the primary were similar. He got about 30 percent of his money from donors who gave $200 or less. Another 28 percent of donations came from people who gave between $201 and $999, and 43 percent from people who gave $1,000 or more. These numbers were compiled by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, and included in a report Reform in an Age of Networked Campaigns, which was published jointly with the Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Institute. During the campaign, Obama ended up opting out of the public financing system for presidential candidates, because the system limits how much money candidates can raise, and Obama realized he could raise much more money outside of the system. (Read more details from our previous report, 'Parallel public financing'? Only partly.) Obama was bothered about opting out of the public financing system, because he believed it would undercut his moral authority in arguing for campaign finance reform, according to Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, who wrote about the decision in his campaign memoir, The Audacity to Win. So the campaign considered opting out of the federal system but limiting contributions to $250. "The idea sounded appealing," Plouffe writes. "But when our finance staff ran the numbers, it became clear this option would produce the worst of both worlds: we would not raise enough money to justify the pummeling we would take." Obama supporters like to counter that Obama raised more money from small donors than any previous candidate for president, which is true. But Obama still needed large donors to fund his campaign. Obama implies that he won the presidency without much money from large donors, and the evidence does not support that. In fact, even if we set the bar for small donors higher -- if we stipulated that everyone who gave less than $1,000 was a small donor -- that still means 43 percent gave more. And the interviewer, John Harwood, was correct when he said Obama got about $1 million from employees of Goldman Sachs; the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics puts the number at $994,795. Obama's skill at raising money from small donors for the 2008 campaign was significant. But Obama was also skilled at raising money from large donors. His statement was, "the vast majority of the money I got was from small donors all across the country." That's not the case.

Among the shower of flyers, the New Hampshire Democratic Party recently labelled Republican gubernatorial candidate Ovide Lamontagne as "radically backward," with an ad that features a photo of a frowning first grader "already one year behind" his classmates because he didn’t go to kindergarten. "Ovide Lamontagne wants to eliminate kindergarten, which will leave our kids one year behind," the mailer states, scrawled in crooked font that looks like a struggling elementary school student could have written it. Democrats have used lines like this throughout the campaign season to attack Republicans who oppose state-mandated kindergarten. The New Hampshire Democratic Party mailer also cites examples from debates and media coverage that show Lamontagne’s "radical agenda that will hurt our public schools." But since the flyer clearly aims at Lamontagne’s views on kindergarten, we’ll stick to that. New Hampshire democrats backed up the flyer by pointing to a debate between Lamontagne and Kevin Smith in August, prior to the Republican primary, to prove Lamontagne wants to "repeal the law ensuring all children can go to kindergarten." At the time, Lamontagne, who served as chairman of the state’s Board of Education, said kindergarten should not be state-mandated. "I’ve always been for local control," Lamontagne said. ""The decision about whether or not to have kindergarten is a decision for the communities and school districts of our state, it is not something that should be compelled, it's really not something that should be compelled by the state. … If you turnover that decision to the state, what other decisions are you going to turn over to the state -- or worse to the federal government?" Press secretary for the state Democratic Party Collin Gately provided us additional back-up including endorsements from The Telegraph and the Concord Monitor for Lamontagne’s opponent, Maggie Hassan and a Telegraph story about a Lamontagne-Hassan debate at Rivier University, quoting Lamontagne: "I support public kindergarten but those decisions should be made by parents and citizens at the local level, not mandated from Concord. Maggie thinks it should be mandated from Concord." Lamontagne spokesman Tom Cronin told PolitiFact New Hampshire that Lamontagne, a former schoolteacher, has "no intention of trying to overturn the kindergarten mandate." "He opposed the original kindergarten mandate years ago because he believed it was the prerogative of local school districts to decided whether or not to offer and fund public kindergarten," Cronin said. If elected governor, Lamontagne could face whether to sign or veto a bill to repeal the state mandating kindergarten. During the 2011, session, state Rep. Jonathan Maltz, R-Hudson, proposed H.B. 631 to repeal the state mandate requiring districts to provide kindergarten programs. The bill specifically addressed repealing SB 530, which provides kindergarten construction grants for districts that do not currently operate kindergarten programs, until every district in the state has a kindergarten program, according to Stephanie Rose, an Associate Policy Analyst with the Education Commission of the States. But Maltz’s bill didn’t gain much traction from House Democrats or Republicans. (It’s worth noting, that some New Hampshire legislators oppose the mandate so vehemently they tried to correlate higher crime rates with towns that offer kindergarten). There’s still the question of whether repealing the state mandate would mean the elimination kindergarten for New Hampshire families. Not quite, history tells us. For decades, New Hampshire was the only state in the country that didn’t require schools to offer public kindergarten. Even so, 140 New Hampshire towns-- more than 90 percent of New Hampshire districts -- already offered free public kindergarten. Nashua, the second largest district in the state -- and where the Democrats’ flyer was mailed -- was one of the communities to offer kindergarten without being required to. "If the state were to repeal the kindergarten mandate I can tell you we would not be looking to eliminate that grade level," Nashua Superintendent Mark Conrad said. "I think it’s well-recognized as an essential part of the public school system throughout the United States." About a dozen districts, representing about 1,500 children, did not offer public kindergarten, until fall 2009, which is when the state officially required kindergarten to be part of an "adequate education." Those children either went to private kindergarten, to out-of-district schools or stayed home. If the mandate was lifted, so could the number of public kindergarten programs in the state. "I also think it would be fair to say, without the mandate, over time, you might find some communities dropping (kindergarten) as they’re pressed for costs that we're all facing in these tough economic times," Conrad added. Our ruling A dramatized New Hampshire Democratic Party flyer tries to make Lamontagne out as a kindergarten abolisher. Lamontagne acknowledges he opposed state-mandated public kindergarten -- and still doesn’t agree with it. But he has no plans to repeal it, which is a far cry from eliminating an entire school grade from public schools. To say repealing the law would "eliminate kindergarten" and put a generation of New Hampshire students "one year behind" is over the top. But doing so would likely impact the families who can’t afford to send their children to private or out-of-district schools for kindergarten. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13420	Says comprehensive immigration reform "will add $700 billion to our economy."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-say-immigration-reform-will-add-70/	Hillary Clinton supports plans by President Barack Obama to defer deportation for millions of people in the country illegally, she said at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute’s annual gala Sept. 15. But there is more to do beyond defending the programs, the Democratic presidential nominee said, such as closing private detention facilities and stopping immigration raids and roundups. "No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning, not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home," Clinton said. "So here's the bottom line: Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy, and enable America to be what it's always been, a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation." We wondered, will an overhaul of the immigration system add $700 billion to the U.S. economy? What we found is that Clinton is citing a reputable estimate, but experts say she ignores the time frame of the economic impact and just what is producing the influx of new money. Clinton’s source Clinton’s campaign said the figure came from a November 2014 fact sheet from the White House on the economic benefits of immigration reform. "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that enacting the Senate immigration reform bill would increase real GDP relative to current law projections by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033 – an increase of roughly $700 billion and $1.4 trillion, respectively, in today’s dollars," the White House said. The CBO in 2013 estimated the economic impact of a version of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) -- commonly known as the "Gang of Eight" bill. The measure, written by four Democratic and four Republican senators, passed the Senate but died in the House. The CBO said calculating the economic impact of the legislation was tricky and questionable. Yet the report says S.744 "would boost economic output" and increase real (inflation-adjusted) GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033. It also projects a U.S. population increase of 10 million by 2023 and 16 million by 2033. Changes in direct spending and revenues would also decrease federal budget deficits by $197 billion from 2014 to 2023 and by nearly $700 billion from 2024 to 2033, the report said. Overall, CBO found that enacting the 2013 bill would: • Increase the size of the labor force (about 6 million in 2023 and 9 million in 2033) and employment • Decrease wages through 2024, but increase them in 2025 and later years • Slightly increase unemployment rate through 2020, but no effect on unemployment rate after 2020 • Raise labor productivity and capital (increase in high-skilled immigrants would lead to technological advancements, including new inventions and improvements in production processes) • Increase amount of capital investment (return on investment would be higher under the proposed legislation) • Result in higher interest rates (with a greater rate of earnings on investments, federal government "would face higher interest rates than under current law because it would be competing with the private sector for investors’ money) Caveats The biggest caveat with Clinton’s claim, experts say, is just where that new money would come from. George J. Borjas, a labor economist specializing in immigration issues and professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the $700 billion increase in GDP would be almost entirely captured by new immigrants migrating to America. "Practically all of that increase in GDP would need to be paid to the immigrants as wages and salaries. They are not going to work for free," Borjas said. What really matters, Borjas said, is the "immigration surplus" — which is the benefit accruing to the native-born population. About 98 percent of the increase in GDP due to immigration goes to immigrant salaries, and about 2 percent goes to natives already living in the United States, Borjas estimates. "Then the question becomes: who did Hillary refer to when she said ‘our economy’? I take it, in the context of a political speech, that means us — the current population of the United States that is voting in November," Borjas said. "I don’t think she meant the future immigrants who have yet to arrive. And, as a result, I would say the statement is false." On the flip side, immigration reform would allow people currently living in the United States illegally additional opportunities for advancement, said David Dyssegaard Kallick, a senior fellow and director of the Immigration Research Initiative at Fiscal Policy Institute. A pathway to citizenship would mean currently undocumented immigrants would have greater potential for advancement and result in more productive employees, Kallick said. "Making sure workers can’t be taken advantage of by employers wouldn’t hurt, either, pushing businesses to compete based on higher productivity rather than evasion of the law," he said. Lastly, any GDP increase would not be automatic. The CBO projected it would take 10 years to increase the GDP by $700 billion. And while $700 billion sounds like a lot, it would remain a tiny fraction of the country’s GDP, which today is nearing $18 trillion. Our ruling Clinton said immigration legislation "will add $700 billion to our economy." Clinton’s statement stems from 2013 estimates of the stalled "Gang of Eight" bill. But that bill couldn't pass, and there's no telling what a future version might look like or mean for the U.S. economy. A Congressional Budget Office report found that if the 2013 bill was enacted, gross domestic product would increase by 3.3 percent in 2023, or roughly $700 billion. Clinton omitted that timeframe in her statement. The report acknowledges that determining economic impact of immigration policies is complex and can be "uncertain." While immigration scholars say the $700 billion estimate is a reasonable estimate, some say increases in GDP would mostly go toward future immigrants, not the current population. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-10354	"McCain will give more tax breaks to big oil."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/10/barack-obama/big-oil-like-all-companies-would-get-tax-break/	A new TV ad from the Obama campaign called "New Energy" takes three swipes at John MCain. We've addressed two of them previously at PolitiFact: that McCain voted with President Bush 95 percent of the time; and that McCain's plan to open up offshore drilling wouldn't result in oil production for at least seven years. Here we will focus on an attack in the ad that has become a common jab in Obama's stump speeches: "McCain will give more tax breaks to big oil." If you read the small print at the bottom of the ad, it cites a March 27, 2008 report from the Center for American Progress Action Fund. The report is titled "The McCain Plan to Cut Oil Company Taxes by Nearly $4 Billion." Here's how the think tank - which is headed by former Clinton chief of staff John D. Podesta - arrived at its headline. McCain has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent to make U.S. corporations more competitive. Says the McCain campaign Web site: "John McCain believes the taxes we impose on American companies should be no higher than the average rate our major trading partners impose on theirs. We currently have the second-highest combined corporate-tax rate in the industrialized world, and it is driving many businesses and the jobs they create overseas." The Center for American Progress Action Fund grabbed the five largest U.S. oil companies from Fortune Magazine's list of the Fortune 50. Then they obtained financial statements for those five companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission and listed the reported current and deferred taxes paid in 2007 to the federal government for income earned from U.S. operations. Based on those figures, they calculated how much less those companies would pay if the corporate tax rate were dropped from 35 percent to 25 percent. The total savings to the five oil companies, $3.8 billion; $1.2 billion Exxon Mobil alone. Obama cited these same numbers in a speech on June 24th, 2008, in Las Vegas. "He's willing to spend nearly $4 billion on more tax breaks for big oil companies," Obama said, "including $1.2 billion for Exxon alone." Obama is cherry-picking here. The corporate tax rate reduction would apply to ALL corporations. Yes, Exxon Mobil, but also to Wal-Mart, General Motors and Home Depot, to name a few of the other Fortune 50 biggies. Even everybody's favorite, Starbucks, would get the same tax break. Obama's statement is technically true, but singling out oil companies suggests McCain has targeted oil companies for tax breaks. He hasn't. We rate Obama's statement, and the claim in the ad, Barely True. As for the other two claims in the ad: * "McCain and Bush support a drilling plan that won't produce a drop of oil for seven years." We addressed this before in PolitiFact, finding that most oil experts say if the U.S. pursued oil drilling in prohibited offshore areas, as McCain has proposed, it would take at least 10 years to realize any significant oil production. McCain has even acknowledged that fact himself, saying in a June 23 town hall meeting in Fresno, Ca., "Even though it may take some years, the fact that we are exploiting those reserves would have psychological impact that I think is beneficial." * McCain has "voted with Bush 95 percent of the time." We've also dealt with this claim previously and concluded that it accurately reflects a 2007 "presidential support" score from Congressional Quarterly. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11153	"While Phil Bredesen was in the governor’s office, the number of Tennesseans on unemployment nearly doubled."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/29/tennessee-republican-party/tennessee-gop-slams-democrat-senate-race-jobs-over/	The U.S. Senate race in Tennessee is starting to heat up. Phil Bredesen, the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, lofted an ad touting his accomplishments as governor. The Tennessee Republican Party fired back that on jobs, Bredesen’s track record wasn’t so rosy. "While Phil Bredesen was in the governor’s office, the number of Tennesseans on unemployment nearly doubled," the GOP posted on its website May 23. "He is backtracking to change his weak record, but Tennesseans won’t be fooled by misleading ads." The post included numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to back up the claim. When Bredesen became governor in January 2003, the state had about 149,000 unemployed people. When he left in January 2011, it had about 296,000. As the Republicans said, that’s about double. Before we get into the caveats, we should note that there’s a flaw in the Republican language. The post talked about "the number of Tennesseans on unemployment." That’s different from the number of unemployed people, because some might not have been eligible for unemployment benefits in the first place, and some might have seen their benefits run out. The state labor market reports track the number of new claims for unemployment each month, but not the total number of people getting benefits at a given point in time. As for the point about unemployment growth, the Republican post leaves out the enormous impact of the Great Recession. That wasn’t something under Bredesen’s control; it was a global economic collapse that struck every state and pretty much every nation worldwide. In the time Bredesen was in office, the national unemployment rate went from 5.8 percent to 9.1 percent. The rate in Tennessee went from 5.1 percent to 9.5 percent; worse than the national average, but the overall trend was the same. This chart shows shifts in the unemployment rate under Bredesen. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The GOP post also overlooks that before the recession, Bredesen oversaw a net increase in jobs. The state had 2.76 million jobs when he took office, and four years later in 2007, it had 2.94 million, a gain of about 180,000 jobs. Even as the automobile sales were falling in 2008, on Bredesen’s watch, Volkswagen committed to building a new plant outside Chattanooga, Tenn., a move that ultimately created 2,000 new jobs. Our ruling The Tennessee Republican Party challenged Bredesen’s track record on jobs, saying that the number of people on unemployment doubled during his time as governor. Government statistics show that the number of unemployed did rise by that amount. But the statement suffers from two flaws: It ignores the impact of the Great Recession which was beyond the control of Bredesen or any state leader. And it assumes that every unemployed person is getting unemployment benefits, which is not accurate. The numbers leave out important context. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02613	"The largest enterprise in the world is the federal government of the United States of America"	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/jan/24/mark-warner/warner-says-us-government-largest-entity-world/	No man-made entity is larger than the U.S. government, says Sen. Mark Warner. The Virginia Democrat made the claim last month during an interview on a radio show hosted by one of his colleagues, Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. Warner was stressing his trademark theme: that Congress needs to take a more organized and long-range approach to budgeting instead of going from crisis to crisis. "I think if folks across America understood how crazy what we were doing in that the largest enterprise in the world is the federal government of the United States of America," he said. "The single largest subset of that is the Defense Department. When you run that large an enterprise on three- and six-month short-term funding resolutions, you actually cost the taxpayer more money that you save because you stop and start contracts, you’re not able to hire people for a long period of time...The amount kind of lost to the taxpayer as well as what it does to our military preparedness, for example, staying on defense, is a huge, huge issue." We wondered if the U.S. government really is the biggest show on earth. Warner spokesman Kevin Hall sent us links to the president’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2014, which ends in September, and to news articles listing the revenue and employee figures for large corporations. Let’s look at employees first. According to White House figures, Uncle Sam employed the equivalent of about 4.3 million full-time workers during the 2013 budget year, which ended Sept. 30. Of them, about 1.5 million are in the military and another 800,000 are civilian workers at the Department of Defense. For comparison, Warner’s office sent us a list of largest worldwide employers published in 2012 by the BBC. We searched on our own for a more current list, but couldn’t find one. Here are the largest employers, behind the U.S. government: China’s People’s Liberation Army, 2.3 million workers Walmart, 2.1 million McDonald’s, 1.9 million UK National Health Service, 1.7 million China National Petroleum Corporation, 1.6 million State Grid Corporation of China, 1.5 million Indian Railways, 1.4 million Indian Armed Forces, 1.3 million. There’s a problem with these figures, however. They don’t offer-to-apples comparison of central government employment in the United States to that in China, the world’s most populous country. Although the data give us an idea of the size of China’s military and its two largest state-owned companies, experts say there is no reliable data on how many people are employed in all sectors of the Chinese government. Two years ago, Liu Xirong, a member of the National People’s Congress in China, cited what he said were official figures showing his nation’s bureaucracy had grown from 6 million public servants in 2006 to 10 million in 2010, according to an article in News China. In response, the State Administration of Civil Service said China’s number of public servants stood at 6.89 million in 2010. These figures did not include state-owned enterprises and organizations, which would grow the number to more than 30 million, News China reported. Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies China’s economy, said it’s reasonable to include the employees of state-run corporations in the count. But even if you don’t, logic says China’s rolls of government workers would be longer than the United States’ roster of 4.3 million employees. "In the U.S., labor is expensive and we have substituted technology as shown by the large decline in clerical workers," he said. "In China, technology is expensive and workers are cheap. I do not know of any fully comparable data. I would be quite confident that on most comparisons, China's workforce would be larger, if for no other reason than the size of its army and security forces." In addition to number of employees, Warner’s office also told us it defines "largest enterprise" by the money an organization takes in and spends. We were pointed to the latest information in the CIA’s World Factbook. It shows the U.S. in 2012 -- with $2.5 trillion in revenues and $3.5 trillion in expenses -- topped all nations in both categories. China, by comparison, collected $1.9 trillion in and spent $2 trillion. Those figures don’t include revenues for China’s state-run corporations which, if added up, would easily exceed the U.S. government’s cash flow. The United States’ budget figures dwarf the finances of the largest corporations in the world. According to CNNMoney’s list, Royal Dutch Shell had the largest revenues last year -- $482 billion. It was followed by WalMart, $469 billion; Exxon Mobil, $450 billion; Sinopec Group, $428 billion; and China National Petroleum, $409 billion. Our ruling Warner said the U.S government is the largest enterprise in the world. His staff said the statement was based on the federal government’s employment and budget. The claim runs aground in China. Warner’s office cites statistics that compare the employment of the U.S. government to parts of the Chinese government, but not the whole. China has issued conflicting numbers on its total number of civil servants, but they all greatly exceed the number of workers paid by the U.S. government. Warner is on better footing on the budgeting side of his claim. A variety of widely used statistics shows no government or corporation raises and spends more money than the U.S. So Warner is wrong on one of measurements and right on the other. We’ll split the difference and rate his statement Half True.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2014-01-24T00:00:00	2013-12-16	['United_States']
pomt-05123	Says GOP U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin "voted twice to end Medicare."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/25/pat-kreitlow/dem-challenger-gop-us-rep-sean-duffy-wisconsin-say/	How preoccupied were Wisconsin political types with the state's gubernatorial recall election? On June 6, 2012, the day after the vote, Democrat Pat Kreitlow used Republican Gov. Scott Walker's victory to whack first-term U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis. Kreitlow, a former state senator and TV anchor, is seeking to oust the former district attorney and MTV reality show star in the November 2012 election. Here's the first paragraph of a two-paragraph news release that Kreitlow issued about Walker's defeat of Democratic Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett: "Governor Walker's margin of victory shows that there are still well over a million Wisconsin residents who believe our leaders should represent regular Wisconsinites and not corporate special interests. Unfortunately, Congressman Sean Duffy does not abide by this belief and voted twice to end Medicare and make seniors pay thousands more for their health care, all to give more tax breaks to multimillionaires and corporations who ship our jobs overseas." Hmmm. Duffy, who represents a northwestern Wisconsin district, voted twice to end Medicare, the federal program that pays the health care bills for Americans over age 65? Deja vu Where have we heard before that Republicans voted end Medicare? Oh, yeah. That was PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year for 2011. Wisconsin Democrats were well represented among those making end-Medicare-related claims, with former state representative Sandy Pasch and state legislative candidate Shelly Moore each earning a Pants on Fire. PolitiFact National pointed out that the target of the Democrats' attacks -- a budget plan advanced by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- would not affect people currently in Medicare, or even people 55 to 65 who would join the program in the next 10 years. Our colleagues also noted that in 2011, the University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org concluded that Medicare would remain an entitlement, though more costly to future beneficiaries. And The Washington Post’s Fact Checker said that while there’s "a worthwhile debate" about whether Ryan’s proposal should be adopted, "it is not true to claim Republicans are trying to ‘kill’ Medicare." That makes three fact checkers knocking down the claim that Republicans voted to end Medicare. Nevertheless, now comes Kreitlow. Kreitlow's case The evidence to back his claim are Duffy's votes in April 2011 and March 2012 for Ryan's budget proposals, said Kreitlow campaign manager Jocelyn Steinberg. The proposals would replace Medicare with a voucher, she claimed. Steinberg cited statements in eight news or opinion articles, including some that vehemently disagreed with PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year selection. Among them: Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman claimed Ryan's 2011 plan "ends Medicare and leaves seniors with a voucher and no guarantee they can afford health care costs that would double." The Economist magazine opined that the plan "ends the guarantee that all American seniors will have health insurance." And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said "most elderly people would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system." There's no question Ryan's 2011 and 2012 budgets, neither of which were adopted, would have dramatically changed Medicare; indeed PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a claim that his plan would privatize Medicare. As our colleagues noted in that item: "Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government, although they would receive "premium support" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money." The point is, Medicare would change -- significantly -- under the proposals Duffy supported. But it would still exist. Asked to respond to Kreitlow's claim, Duffy campaign manager Justin Richards simply noted PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year selection. Our rating Kreitlow said Duffy "voted twice to end Medicare." But under the proposals Duffy voted for, a revamped Medicare would remain. At this stage, Kreitlow’s statement is false and ridiculous -- Pants on Fire.	None	Pat Kreitlow	None	None	None	2012-06-25T09:00:00	2012-06-06	['United_States', 'Wisconsin', 'Sean_Duffy']
pomt-12687	"Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/14/rosemary-laird/do-half-million-people-florida-have-alzheimers-dis/	A Florida physician who specializes in geriatrics and memory care warned a Florida Senate committee that Alzheimer’s disease is both a present and a looming problem for the state. "Please make no mistake -- we are in the midst of an epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease," Rosemary Laird, a geriatrician at the Centre for Senior Health in Winter Park, told the Senate Health Policy Committee on March 14. "Currently, half a million Floridians have Alzheimer’s disease, and in less than 10 years, a 40 percent growth rate means that another 200,000 Floridians will develop this devastating illness." Laird was testifying in favor of SB 1050, a bill sponsored by Sen. David Simmons, R-Longwood, to establish a memory disorder clinic at Florida Hospital in Orange County. Laird’s office did not return a call, but we were able to find statistics that closely matched what she told the committee. They were cited in "2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures," a report by the Alzheimer’s Association, the leading advocacy group for patients with the severe memory-loss condition and their families and caregivers. The report, in Table 4, offers projections for state-by-state numbers of residents with Alzheimer’s in 2017 and 2025. For Florida, it lists 520,000 people with the disease in 2017 and 720,000 for 2025, a growth rate of 38.5 percent. Rounded off, those are essentially identical to the figures Laird cited. However, it’s worth noting that the table cites these figures as "estimates" (for 2017) and "projected" (for 2025). The numbers in the report are footnoted to a study published in the academic journal Neurology in May 2013. The authors used Alzheimer’s diagnosis statistics from 2010 to create estimates of how many cases would be expected in future years as far out as 2050. Given the margins of error in estimates and projections, and given the difficulty of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease in patients, it’s a slight overreach for Laird to frame these as hard numbers of Floridians who have the disease today. They are a useful yardstick and were published in a respected scientific journal, but her phrasing suggests too high a degree of certainty about the numbers who have the disease today. "It is accurate to say that the numbers are estimates, or as we put it in the report, ‘projections,’ " said Laura Cilmi, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer’s Association.

pomt-14529	Says she will "work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it’s ever been — $12 an hour in today’s dollars."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-wants-return-real-minimum/	Calls to raise the minimum wage -- something that hasn’t been done in seven years -- are a staple of many Democratic campaigns. Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid is no exception. In a Feb. 12 Medium post, Clinton wrote, "As president, I will work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it’s ever been  —  $12 an hour in today’s dollars  —  and support state and local efforts to go even further." Here we’re checking if Clinton’s proposal to raise the minimum wage to $12 an hour would bring the minimum wage "back to the highest level it’s ever been." We began by looking at the history of the inflation-adjusted minimum wage and found that the highest-ever inflation-adjusted value was $10.69 an hour in February 1968. The second-highest was $9.69 an hour in February 1967. You can see the data here and in the following graph. So Clinton’s $12 minimum wage actually would go beyond restoring, or bringing back, the minimum wage to its highest level ever. It would be $1.31 an hour higher in purchasing power than the previous record -- or 12 percent higher. What’s going on? When we asked the Clinton campaign for an explanation, they pointed to a paper by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This paper looked at how the minimum wage compared to the median wage at the time. According to the paper, in 1968, the minimum wage was about half as high as the median wage at the time -- 52.1 percent. By 2014, that had fallen to 37.1 percent, meaning that wages overall had risen while the minimum wage failed to keep up. Looking ahead to a proposed $12 minimum wage, the paper estimated that raising the minimum wage that high would bring the ratio back up to between 49.9 percent and 54.1 percent, or roughly what it was in 1968. And it found similar results when using a different benchmark -- the average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory production workers. Economists we checked with thought this was a credible standard for Clinton to use, and using this statistic supports her overall point. Indeed, Clinton would have been correct if she’d said she would work to raise the federal minimum wage back to where it was in comparison to the median wage at its historical record. But outside the economics department lounge, that’s a much bigger mouthful than saying she’d bring the minimum wage "back to the highest level it’s ever been — $12 an hour in today’s dollars." The problem for Clinton’s streamlined phrasing is that it oversimplifies in a way that could give readers a misleading impression. The term "today’s dollars" usually means "inflation-adjusted," and using the inflation-adjusted minimum wage, she’s wrong that a $12 minimum wage has historical precedent. Our ruling Clinton said she will "work to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest level it’s ever been — $12 an hour in today’s dollars." The minimum wage has never previously been "$12 an hour in today’s dollars" -- it’s gone as high as $10.69 an hour. However, Clinton has a point using other economic data. The data suggests that a $12 minimum wage would be similar to the 1968 wage when compared to median wages at the time. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-02-17T14:27:33	2016-02-12	['None']
pomt-06734	"We spend less on defense today as % of GDP than at any time since Pearl Harbor."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/29/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-defense-spending-historic-low/	In case you missed it, there’s been a lot of talk recently about spending cuts in Washington, D.C. Led largely by conservative Republicans, Congress curtailed future spending by more than $3 trillion earlier this month. But there’s one element of the federal budget that some conservatives are reluctant to curtail -- money for guns, fighters, tanks and missiles. A few Republican presidential candidates are even calling for increased military spending as they rally the base in anticipation of next year’s primaries. For example, Newt Gingrich, Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. House speaker, last month tweeted: "We spend less on defense today as % of GDP than at any time since Pearl Harbor." In 1941 the country was unprepared to fight the Axis powers, but today, with thousands of soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, cruise missiles raining down on Libya and predator drones circling terrorist enclaves across the globe, is our investment in defense really comparable to the days preceding the Japanese sneak attack? Gingrich and his staff did not return calls seeking clarification of his tweet. Benjamin Friedman, a defense research fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said this lack of response is predictable. Friedman said politicians and other policy wonks sometimes use the percentage of gross domestic product, which refers to the value of all goods and services produced in the country, spent on defense as a talking point to support spending billions more on military gear. But he said the statement is so "indefensibly false" they typically will not engage in a discussion about the concept. "They’re not lying, they’re just being deliberately obtuse and misleading," he said. The actual numbers don’t help Gingrich. The United States spent 4.8 percent of its GDP on defense in 2010, according to statistics from the Office of Management and Budget. Defense spending was smaller than 4.8 percent of the GDP from 2009 back through 1991, 1979, 1978 and 1948. "It’s wrong for every year since the end of the Cold War and other years besides," Friedman said. So Gingrich is flat out wrong on his statement, but maybe the facts were erroneous -- grossly erroneous, true -- but the general idea that we spend less is still spot on? Gingrich is wrong there, too, said Gordon Adams, a former senior White House national security budget official for President Bill Clinton. "Beyond the point of him being factually incorrect, it’s an irrelevant measure," Adams said. "The GDP is a completely red herring argument. It doesn’t tell you how much you’re spending in real dollars or what you’re getting." Adams and Friedman both point out the GDP is growing and therefore tying defense spending to the GDP would suggest military spending would have to increase every year. "It’s kind of crazy to say you should have a fixed percentage of your wealth to spend on defense because your enemies and circumstances in the world change," Friedman said. A better way to compare defense spending, or any kind of government spending over a long period of time, is to use dollars adjusted for inflation, Adams said. The United States spent $700 billion on defense in 2010, $300 billion more than the adjusted Cold War average, Adams said. Winslow Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project, said defense spending also does not include funding for other agencies that contribute to national defense such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State Department. "It’s a distorted way to think of it for the sole purpose to pimp for more money," Wheeler said. Gingrich tweeted that the country now spends less on defense as a percentage of the GDP than at any time since the start of World War II. That’s a firm statement, but since the Cold War ended, and in a few other years as well, the percent of GDP used for defense has been consistently lower than current spending levels. Further, experts say the concept is highly misleading. Gingrich gets our lowest rating on this one.

pomt-09703	The GOP health care plan "would allow health insurance companies to continue engaging in unfair and discriminatory practices like denying coverage to people because of a pre-existing medical condition."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/05/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-says-gop-alternative-health-care/	The GOP's alternative health care plan hadn't even hit the streets before the Democratic push-back began. The day before the plan was officially unveiled, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., took aim at the way the GOP plan was described by media outlets that had gotten early, leaked versions of it. In a press release from the Democratic National Committee, Vice Chair Wasserman Schultz said the GOP plan, "would allow health insurance companies to continue engaging in unfair and discriminatory practices like denying coverage to people because of a pre-existing medical condition." Requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions has been a popular element of the Democratic plan. Now that we've seen the full 219-page GOP alternative plan, it shows Wasserman Schultz is correct that it does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people due to pre-existing medical conditions. But to listen to her, one might get the impression the Republicans have completely ignored the issue of pre-existing conditions. And they haven't. They have a different idea that they think will get at the problem. More than 10 pages of the GOP bill spell out a plan to help people with pre-existing conditions by allowing universal access to expanded and improved state-run high-risk pools. They accept patients who have health conditions that might prompt private insurance companies to reject them. Already, 34 states have high-risk insurance pools. "We want to encourage all states to have these," said House Republican Leader John Boehner. "And we put more money into these high-risk pools so that we can bring down the cost of health insurance. And at the end of the day, what we're doing with our proposal is lowering health care insurance premiums — lowering cost and expanding access." The Republican plan calls for $25 billion in funding through 2019 to subsidize state high risk pool and reinsurance programs. In an MSNBC interview on Nov. 4, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said the cost of bolstering state funds and insurance programs to cover people with pre-existing conditions would be offset by savings from medical malpractice reforms that he said would "rein in some of these runaway massive lawsuits that drive defensive medicine and drive up the cost of premiums." Democrats counter that high-risk insurance pools have done little to solve the problems faced by people with pre-existing medical conditions. Premiums in those pools are usually far more expensive than in your average health insurance plan, and therefore remain out of reach for many moderate to low-income people with pre-existing conditions. The Republican plan tries to address that by requiring that the pool "must limit the pool premiums to no more than 150 percent of the average premium for applicable standard risk rates in that state." In other words, it might cost people with pre-existing conditions 50 percent more than average premiums paid by healthy people. But a study shows that might make the price too high. A February 2005 study by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund found that in states with high-risk pools, the rates were typically 25 percent to 50 percent higher than average rates. People with lower incomes just couldn't afford to buy into the state pools. As a result, they found, high-risk pool subsidies tended to go to a small number of relatively high-income people, those who could afford premiums well above market rates. The GOP plan for dealing with the issue of people with pre-existing conditions "is essentially the same as now, and now is not working," said Jonathan Beeton, a spokesman for Wasserman Schultz. Wasserman Schultz was correct when she said the GOP plan does not prohibit health insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. We found nothing in the 219-page Republican plan that would do that. Insurance companies have argued that they can only absorb the cost of taking people with pre-existing conditions if they could offset that expense by expanding their customer base through mandates that everyone buy insurance. And the Republican plan doesn't do that. Still, we think Wasserman Schultz's comments imply that Republicans have simply ignored the issue of pre-existing conditions altogether. They have not. They have taken a different tack from the Democrats. And Democrats may not agree that dealing with the issue through state-run high-risk pools is an adequate plan, but it is a plan. And so we rule Wasserman Schultz's comment Mostly True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2009-11-05T13:31:53	2009-11-03	['None']
pomt-06038	Says Rick Perry cut taxes.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/13/craig-james/craig-james-republican-senate-candidate-says-rick-/	CORRECTION, 4:45 p.m. Jan. 17, 2012: This fact check originally presented per-capita state and local sales tax collections for 2000 and 2010 attributed to information from the U.S. Census Bureau. But, as a reader helpfully pointed out, those figures solely reflected state taxes. This article has been revised accordingly. The changes do not affect the rating of the statement. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Craig James, a former ESPN football analyst, saluted Gov. Rick Perry in an online video posted Jan. 3, 2012, saying Perry "changed Texas--cut waste, reduced taxes, put people back to work. And that’s just what I’ll do in Washington." We’re not sure how to gauge how Perry cut waste or personally put people to work. But it’s possible to gauge if he reduced taxes. Caveat: Per-person tax collections go up and down partly due to changes in state tax policy, though they’re also affected by population growth and the economy. Another vantage point: Each resident’s taxes change depending on personal circumstances -- a job change, a move, the purchase or sale of a house. Until a few years ago, the U.S Census Bureau calculated per-capita state and local taxes collected. In 2000, the year that Perry became governor, state government collected $1,315 per person, a rate that was the 49th lowest among the states. That would have been $1,665 in 2010 dollars, according to our calculation using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator. In 2010, state government in Texas collected $1,567 per person; we reached this figure by dividing the bureau’s tabulation of Texas state taxes collected that year, nearly $39.4 billion, by the state’s April 2010 population of 25.1 million. So, those collections ran about $100 less per person than the inflation-adjusted amount collected in 2000. There are other calculations. Per-person state tax collections were slightly higher in 2007 than in 2001, according to information published by the advisory Legislative Budget Board. In 2001, Perry’s first full year as governor, the state reaped nearly $1,377 in tax revenue per resident. In 2007, according to the board’s latest Fiscal Size-Up publication, the state gathered nearly $1,691 per resident, which was equivalent to $1,444 in 2001 dollars, according to our check on the BLS calculator. So, that suggests a $67 per person increase in state taxes. However, experts cautioned us against reaching sweeping conclusions about Perry and taxes based on measures of total tax collections. The reality is he’s signed both tax hikes and cuts into law. Neither the state sales or gas tax -- two major revenue generators -- has been hiked during Perry’s governorship. But in 2006, he approved a package of changes including a $1-a-pack cigarette tax hike, modification in how the state taxes used-car purchases and an overhaul of the state’s business franchise tax, all toward covering a mandated one-third reduction in local school property tax rates. Separately over the years, as we noted in a November 2010 fact check, Perry signed into law higher taxes on smokeless tobacco, fireworks and the purchase or rental of diesel equipment. He also has agreed to fee increases, which some liken to tax bumps. Perry has said the 2006 increases shouldn't be counted against him because the cuts in property taxes set in motion by lawmakers were bigger. Told by the Texas Tribune in 2010 that some people consider the franchise tax change to be an increase, Perry replied: "That was a net tax decrease." An August 2008 analysis of the 2006 changes by the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association says that while some taxes clearly were raised, those increases were dwarfed by nearly $7 billion for 2007 in legislated property tax cuts. That’s not to say, though, that taxes went down -- only that they did not continue escalating as they would have under previous law, the association said. If lawmakers had not acted, its analysis says, taxpayers would have seen an estimated $4.7 billion tax increase to fund school maintenance and operations between 2005 and 2007. Instead, the average Texan’s total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been without the legislative action, the analysis says. The analysis says many Texans were still paying higher property taxes in 2007 than they did in 2005, before the tax changes, for several reasons: --Almost all school districts exercised their authority to increase tax rates above the state-mandated one-third reduction; --Local voters approved additional taxes to pay for debt service for facilities, which went up 37 percent from 2005 to 2007; --Residential property values accelerated; --And city, county and special district property taxes continued to increase. These factors combined produced a total property tax bill for Texans that was $1.7 billion higher than came due in 2005, the analysis says. It closes: "Even so, there is no doubt the actions taken in 2006 have saved Texans an estimated $7 billion a year in property taxes. The average Texan’s property tax bill may not be lower than it was two years ago, but it is unmistakably much, much lower than it would have been." By email, the group’s president, Dale Craymer, recently told us that Perry reduced taxes overall. "The 2006 package raised the franchise and cigarette taxes, but for each dollar raised the property tax was lowered by more than $3," Craymer said, "so the package clearly nets out as a sizable tax cut (overall, probably the biggest tax cut in history)." In 2011, he added, the state cost of school property tax relief as required by the 2006 law amounts to about $7 billion -- with the state tax changes from 2006 generating $2.2 billion of that, he said. That is, the local property tax load was lightened considerably more than state taxes were up. By email, Dick Lavine, a tax expert for the Austin-based, liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, agreed school taxes were cut, though, Lavine said, lawmakers also left a multibillion-dollar gap between available revenue and "necessary" state expenditures, or "structural deficit," that must be addressed each legislative session. Eva DeLuna Castro, the center’s senior budget analyst, separately pointed out that total collected state and local taxes, including property taxes, annually increased all but one year from 2006 through 2010. The year-to-year increase from 2008 to 2009 was only $300 million, while from 2009 to 2010, such collections dropped $1.7 billion to $81 billion, a decrease DeLuna attributed to the national recession. "Sorry, I’m going to give all of you a Pants on Fire," Castro said by email. "Taxes have not been reduced. At best, (Perry) ‘bent the curve?’" In an interview, Will Newton, executive director of the Texas chaper of the National Federation of Independent Business, pointed out that Perry also signed into law changes that increased the number of businesses exempted from the revised franchise tax. The 2006 law excused businesses with total revenues of $300,000 or less. A few years later, Perry agreed to exempt businesses with total revenue of $1 million or less. "That’s a really big thing for smaller businesses," Newton said. In another fact check, we looked at another way of gauging Texas taxes under Perry. The non-partisan Tax Foundation, based in Washington, annually estimates how much residents of each state cough up for state and local taxes. In 2000, Texans were taxed at an effective rate of 7.1 percent, meaning 7.1 cents of every dollar in income went to state and local taxes. That year, the foundation says, each resident paid about $2,214, on average. In 2009, the latest year checked, Texans paid an effective rate of 7.9 percent; the per-person amount of state and local taxes paid was $3,197-- up 44 percent from 2000, or 17 percent adjusted for inflation. As noted in a July 17, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article, the 7.9 percent compared with the national average of 9.8 percent and only five states (Alaska, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming) had lower state-local tax burdens than Texas. Our ruling Perry put in motion major tax hikes generating less revenue than state-ordered reductions in local school property taxes the governor also signed into law. However, it’s overly simplistic to say that Perry simply reduced taxes. He cut some, raised others. This statement rates Half True.

pomt-10149	"We're building a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline, which is North America's largest and most expensive infrastructure project ever."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/03/sarah-palin/palin-exaggerates-status-cost-of-pipeline/	In the vice presidential debate, Gov. Sarah Palin repeated claims she has made from time to time about a plan to build a natural gas pipeline in Alaska. After arguing the wisdom of the chant, "Drill, baby, drill" — heard frequently at McCain-Palin rallies — she followed up with this: "Even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas. And we're building a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline — which is North America's largest and most expensive infrastructure project ever — to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets." It certainly would be something to boast about if Alaska had started building a natural gas pipeline under Palin. The state has been trying to get a pipeline built from its natural gas-rich North Slope for some three decades. But her claim is premature. We've scrutinized her claims on the pipeline before (see our review of her claim about the cost here and a look at the status of the project here ) and found them less than accurate. Palin did spearhead a plan under which TransCanada Corp., a Canadian company, will get $500-million in state funds to design and seek approvals for the pipeline. But they are not obligated to build it. Financing and approvals are far from certain, and the company can back out even if those contingencies come through. TransCanada does not anticipate construction beginning until at least 2015, and several experts we spoke to were skeptical that the company's plan would come to fruition. "I'll believe it when I see it," said Sarah Ladislaw, a fellow specializing in Western Hemispheric energy issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Palin has repeatedly mischaracterized the agreement with TransCanada. In a news conference in Alaska on Aug. 1, 2008, she said the state never before had "commitments to build this line. Now we do." In its news story the next day, the Anchorage Daily News wrote: "That's incorrect. TransCanada has not promised to actually build the gas line, one of the state's grandest and most frustrated economic development dreams." Now what about Palin's claim that the pipeline would cost "nearly $40-billion"? We're not sure where she got that figure — neither her office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign has ever returned our calls to tell us. TransCanada estimates the cost at $26-billion. Yes, there could be cost overruns. But experts were skeptical the price could reach Palin's estimate. Palin was certainly wrong that the pipeline would be the "most expensive infrastructure project ever." What we suspect she meant to say — and has said repeatedly in the past — is that it would be the most expensive privately funded infrastructure project ever. But she's probably wrong on that count, too. We talked to several experts in pipelines and large-scale engineering projects, who said the only private infrastructure project on the scale of Palin's proposed pipeline was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, an oil pipeline also from the North Slope that is often referred to as the Alaska Pipeline. The Alaska Pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of $8-billion. In 2007 dollars that would be just over $27-billion, edging out Palin's proposed natural gas pipeline. While there are plans on the drawing board to build a pipeline, and Palin moved them forward in certain respects as governor, her claim in the debate suggests construction is underway, when that's not true. And she overstated the estimated cost of the project. We find her claim to be False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-10-03T00:00:00	2008-10-02	['None']

Once such attempt, with headlines such as "Soros Provides Migrants With Prepaid Debit Cards To Fund Illegal Journeys," was posted on News Punch Nov. 5. But the story doesn't talk about the Honduran migrants. Instead, it says that Soros has been helping out migrants coming to Europe from Syria and other countries. "The European migrant crisis is being fueled by free cash handouts from the United Nations, European Union and George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, according to bombshell information from Europe which suggests the UN, EU and Soros are luring illegal migrants to the continent with money," News Punch says. The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The "bombshell information" link sends readers to a Slovenian website called nova24tv.si and an Oct. 30 story expresses alarm over Muslim migrants coming into Europe. It questions where the migrants are getting their money and focuses on prepaid debit cards that carry the MasterCard logo and have been given to migrants. The Nova24TV story says they are paid for by the U.N.'s World Food Program. But there's no mention of Soros as a source of the cards. Instead, the Nova24TV story asks, "Does the EU, directly with taxpayers' money, finance the violence that the Islamic invasion brings with it to European countries?" The blue cards carry the logo of The UN Refugee Agency and a case study evaluating how well the card was helping refugees, found on the ReliefWeb.int website, doesn't mention Soros or a Soros organization. So why is Soros being pegged with providing these cards? Nearly two years ago, Soros and Mastercard announced "plans to explore creating a social enterprise to apply commercial strategies to deliver a positive impact on society. Called Humanity Ventures, the enterprise could catalyze and accelerate economic and social development for vulnerable communities around the world, especially refugees and migrants." The Jan. 19, 2017 news release isn't specific about what programs Soros' Humanity Ventures would try, but the bloggers are making the connection without offering any evidence. In fact, it's clear from the "bombshell" source News Punch is citing that by time the Soros-Mastercard agreement was announced, the UN Refugee Agency prepaid debit cards had been around for at least four years. The Nova24TV story says that a Mastercard website was reporting that 300,000 people in places like Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt had received the cards by the end of 2013 and Mastercard "wanted to distribute 2.5 million such cards to be used in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey" by the end of 2014. The website Inside Philanthropy reported shortly after the announcement that Humanity Ventures, a for-profit organization, "plans to combine existing global health and development solutions to expand access to healthcare and education, as well as to improve local economic development and entrepreneurship. An additional goal of the organization is to improve the delivery of humanitarian aid." So has the Soros initiative included adding money to some of those prepaid Mastercards to migrants in Europe? Soros spokesman Michael Vachon said in an email the claim is false. MasterCard and the philanthropist "have been in discussions about joint investment opportunities," he said. "None has reached fruition so far." Without that connection, this debit card claim is overdrawn. We rate it False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-11-13T13:56:29	2018-11-05	['None']
pomt-04059	We have the fourth highest in-state tuition for public universities in the country.	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/jan/25/maggie-hassan/new-governor-claims-new-hampshire-college-costs-ar/	New Hampshire officials usually like to see the state’s colleges and universities climb the national rankings. But there’s at least one ranking New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan would like to avoid. Minutes after Hassan was sworn in as New Hampshire’s 81st governor, she took state legislators and university administrators to task for high tuition costs, which do little but chase students out of state, she said. "Our population is aging, yet we pursue policies that are driving our young people out of the state," Hassan said during her Jan 3. inauguration speech. "We have the fourth highest in-state tuition for public universities in the country, and too many of our talented students pursue a college education elsewhere." In New Hampshire, as in the rest of the country, tuition costs have risen dramatically in recent years. But are they really among the nation’s highest? We decided to do the homework. To start, here’s a quick overview of the New Hampshire university system. In total, the state houses four public, four-year schools -- the University of New Hampshire, Keene State College, Plymouth State University and Granite State College. Together, the schools served 35,200 students in 2012 at 14 campuses across the state, according to the University System of New Hampshire’s 2012 Annual Report. Tuition varies at each school, and often at each campus. So, we approached Hassan’s office to determine which she referred to. As expected, Hassan’s representatives pointed us to the system’s flagship school,UNH, which is by far the state’s largest school. For the 2012-13 school year, UNH administrators are charging $16,422 per year for state residents on the Durham campus, according to the University website. Officials at the U.S. Department of Education, which tracks tuition costs through its College Affordability and Transparency Center, have not yet analyzed the 2012 data to determine the most costly schools. But this summer they did release rankings based on 2010-11 data, and, according to their findings, UNH did charge one of the nation’s highest in-state tuition. That year, the school charged $13,672 for in-state students. That rate, which includes some required fees, trailed only Pennsylvania State University’s University Park campus ($15,250), the University of Pittsburgh ($14,936) and the University of Vermont ($14,066). Considering room and board, among other costs, UNH’s average net price jumped to $17,234 for in-state students. That figure, which considers the average amount of state and federal grants and scholarships, was good for 18th highest among public universities in 2010-11, according to the federal data. But, for this piece, we’re concerned with tuition rates, not total costs. New Hampshire’s other schools rated as more affordable. Neither Keene State College ($10,140 tuition for in-state students), Plymouth State University ($9,906) or Granite State College ($6,435) ranked among the 30 most expensive traditional, four-year schools. In her claim, however, Hassan didn’t specify four-year schools. So, we expanded our research to include community colleges and other public, two-year schools. Even then, UNH still ranked fifth nationally for highest tuition. Only the Michigan Career and Technical Institute ($16,200) placed above it. (As a side note, all seven of New Hampshire’s community colleges ranked among the top 12 most expensive two-year schools in 2010-11, ranging from $6,432 to $7,123 for in-state tuition.) Costs at most of the schools have moved since the 2010-11 ratings. Last year, as New Hampshire legislators cut state funding by a record 49 percent, UNH officials raised in-state tuition more than 11 percent to $15,250, which pushed it past the University of Vermont on the list of most expensive schools. And this year, tuition rose again, this time reaching $16,422, according to university records. Looking forward, administrators have pledged to freeze tuition costs if state lawmakers agree to restore the funding cuts from previous years. "We work continuously to reduce costs and increase non-tuition revenue streams," Erika Mantz, a university spokeswoman, said this week. "These accomplishments aside, we know there is still a lot of work to be done. Access and affordability remain central priorities." Our ruling Data for the 2011-12 or 2012-13 school years isn’t available yet. But, according to the U.S. Department of Education, which compares tuition rates across the country, the University of New Hampshire was one of the nation’s most expensive schools in 2010-11 for in-state students. The state’s other public schools -- Granite State College, Keene State College and Plymouth State University -- didn’t make the national list. But UNH’s $13,672 tuition placed fourth at the time, trailing only Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Vermont. We rate the claim True.

pomt-00240	Says Andrew Gillum has presided over "the highest crime in Florida four years running."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/oct/08/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-says-tallahassee-mayor-andrew-gillum-/	Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum wants a promotion to the governor’s office. But Republican rival Ron DeSantis says the state would be in trouble if that happened based on Gillum’s track record with crime in the capital city. "This is a guy that is presiding over the highest crime in Florida four years running," DeSantis said on CBS4 Jim DeFede’s show Sept. 23. One week later on DeFede’s show, Gillum boasted about a drop in crime. "I'm the mayor of a city that right now is experiencing a five-year low in our crime rate and we accomplished that by having fewer arrests at the same time," Gillum said. We decided to fact-check both candidates who are running for governor. We found that both DeSantis and Gillum point to valid statistics, but they are cherry-picked. Here, we will fact-check the statement by DeSantis that Gillum has presided over the highest crime in Florida four years running. FBI data on Leon County crime rate Leon County and the city of Tallahassee have been in the limelight for crime in recent years. Experts generally focus on crime rates per 100,000 residents rather than sheer numbers of crimes. Crime rate data submitted by law enforcement to the FBI shows that there were 4,802 crimes per 100,000 residents in Leon County in 2017. The data includes violent offenses such as murder and rape and property offenses such as theft. In 2017, Leon County had the highest crime rate of all Florida counties. Leon County’s crime rate was the highest in Florida in 2014, 2015 and 2016, too. While Leon County is a broader area than just the city of Tallahassee, the Tallahassee Police Department handles the bulk of the county’s crime. Gillum’s former chief of staff, who is now running for mayor, has also made statements about the high crime rate and "the highest number of murders in history last year." There were 17 murders in 2017 compared to 11 the year before. The Gillum campaign, however, has said the crime stats actually have good news, too: The county crime rate overall dropped between 2016 and 2017 by 15 percent. The statistics based on crimes reported only by the Tallahassee Police Department showed a similar decrease. And the downward trend has continued for the first half of 2018. The Tallahassee Police Department ranks 28th in the crime rate when examining all cities and counties in 2017. However, a comparison of all departments isn’t particularly useful because that combines tiny towns and large counties. Tallahassee’s population is about 190,000. When looking at cities with a population of at least 90,000, Tallahassee’s rate in 2017 was lower than Miami Beach, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale — all cities with a high number of visitors or workers who may not live in the city. While DeSantis didn’t single out any type of crime, the data shows that the majority of the crimes reported by the Tallahassee police department were larcencies. That includes anything from shoplifting to breaking into a car and stealing a briefcase, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said. Limitations of crime rate data The American Society of Criminology and FBI caution about the pitfalls of using crime statistics to rank communities. Such rankings ignore local characteristics that influence crime, such as poverty rates and the concentration of the youth population. Tallahassee is a college town -- home to Florida State University and Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University -- as well as the state government. A city mayor has relatively little control over the characteristics most often identified as the strongest predictors of local crime rates such as poverty and the age of residents, said Brian Stults, an associate criminology professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee. The mayor may have some control over the size of the police department, but studies are inconsistent about whether increases in police size and funding lead to decreases in crime, Stults said. The more important factor is not how many police you have, but how they police. A city spokeswoman said Tallahassee has hired a few dozen more police officers during Gillum’s tenure as mayor, growing the force by about 11 percent. Understanding the crime rate requires a look at the specific characteristics of Tallahassee. The city has a large number of visitors who do not live year-round in the city, including students, lobbyists, politicians and other people who work in the capital city but may live in other cities. That means that crimes committed against — or by — students or commuters who work in the capital city are included in the count of Tallahassee’s crimes, but many of them are not counted in the residential population of the city. Mayors, and police chiefs, can influence the strategies the police department uses, but the results that flow from these strategies take time, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a police officer in Bartow, Fla., in the 1970s. Experts caution against giving politicians credit or blame for declines or increases in crime, which are more likely a function of social changes in the community or economy than political actions. Our ruling DeSantis said Gillum has presided over "the highest crime in Florida four years running." DeSantis was referring to the crime rate in Leon County, in which Tallahassee represents most cases. Data shows that Leon County had the highest crime rate in Florida in recent years. DeSantis omits that the county’s crime rate in 2017 declined from 2016. A few cities had higher crime rates, but like Tallahassee, they draw a lot of visitors who aren’t included in the residential population. Experts and the FBI caution against using the statistics to compare jurisdictions because it fails to take into account unique characteristics, such as a high college student population or visitors.

pomt-12767	"Local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015. Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/feb/23/steve-adler/steve-adler-says-authorities-43-states-turned-down/	Austin Mayor Steve Adler says Travis County’s sheriff isn’t out of line by not automatically honoring federal requests that specific suspects be held 48 hours so immigration authorities can step in. Adler’s February 2017 open letter to residents objects to U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement officers arresting Austin-area residents suspected of living in the country without legal authorization.The letter further says that "participating in a voluntary, warrantless ‘detainer’ program, which is not required by law, will make our community less safe because it jeopardizes community trust." "In fact, and you wouldn’t know it from the debate here locally, local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015," Adler's letter says. "Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states," Adler wrote. We wondered about those figures. Have detainer requests been turned down almost everywhere? Mayor’s backup Adler was piping up in defense of the county’s new sheriff, Sally Hernandez, a Democrat who announced in January 2017 that as of the next month, her department would agree to hold an inmate in response to an ICE detainer request only if she or he were charged with murder, aggravated sexual assault or human trafficking — or if agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant. Otherwise, inmates would be allowed to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Through the first eight days of implementation, we later determined, 45 individuals for whom detainer requests were denied were released by the county--with about 150 inmates whose detainer requests were refused remaining behind bars, in some cases unable to make bond. Adler’s letter includes, right next to the figures, a web link to a Feb. 10, 2017, story posted by Stateline, a nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts journalism project that focuses on state policies. The story, "Sheriffs Still Looking for Clarity on Deportation," introduces the Adler-cited figures after referring to President Donald Trump’s January 2017 executive order directing federal agencies to act against "removable" immigrants and to enlist state and local law enforcement agencies to apprehend such individuals: "When considering whether to deport prisoners under Obama administration policies, ICE focused on those deemed to ‘pose a threat to public safety’ because of gang activity or felony convictions unrelated to immigration status. Trump’s executive order expands that focus to include any criminal activity, fraud or abuse of public benefits, or failure to obey a court order to leave the country. "Local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015. Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states." A 26-month study The story lacks a source for those numbers. But to our query, Stateline reporter Tim Henderson pointed us to a chart posted in August 2016 by the Syracuse University-based Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which describes itself as a data gathering, research and distribution organization focused on federal staffing, spending and enforcement activities. TRAC’s chart (Table 1 here), drawing on ICE data, indicates that from October 2013 to December 2015, local police agencies in 43 states refused to honor 16,296 detainer requests--as Adler basically said. Nationally, the chart says, 6.1 percent of detainer requests were denied over the 26 months. Also as Adler said, the chart identifies Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming as the only states where no requests were denied, together accounting for a scant 1,056 of 267,548 of the total detainer requests tallied nationally. For our part, we noticed that adding up the tallies shown for each of the states yielded smaller totals than the national totals topping the chart. That is, it looked like among the 50 states over the 26 months, 13,372 of 242,525 detainer requests were denied, which breaks out to a 5.5 percent denial rate or 94.5 percent detainer approval rate. So, would it be more accurate to say that more than 13,000 (not more than 16,000) detainer requests were denied in 43 states? It's not that simple. First, a note below the chart clarifies that the presented national totals fold in detainer requests submitted to and denied by jurisdictions in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories as well as requests made or denied for which a state wasn’t listed on federal paperwork. Second, Sue Long, the clearinghouse’s director, told us by phone that most detainer requests and denials tallied in the national totals but not showing in the state-by-state entries reflect gaps or blanks in ICE forms related to actions in states, not in Puerto Rico or beyond. Long otherwise cautioned that denials of detainer requests shouldn’t instantly be characterized as local law agencies failing to cooperate with federal colleagues. For instance, she said, local jurisdictions might wish to maintain control over the prosecution of a local crime rather than risk losing a suspect to deportation. Also, Long advised, the clearinghouse has yet to reach a more up-to-date analysis of detainer requests and requests denied. ICE-provided data, she said, has proved increasingly incomplete. Most detainer refusals in a few states We noticed that TRAC’s chart gives helpful context to the mayor’s claim. For instance, the chart shows the bulk of detainer denials in the study period occurred in a handful of states with only a few occurring in each of more than 20 states including Texas, which led the nation with 58,452 federal requests to hold suspects--and agencies in the state refused only 18 requests. From the chart, we broke out the 10 states that fielded the greatest number of detention requests--finding refusal rates ranging from nearly zero in several states up to 15 percent or 16 percent in three states: STATE Total Requests to Detain Requests Refused* % Requests Refused TEXAS 58,452 18 0.03% CALIFORNIA 46,444 7,292 15.70% ARIZONA 16,724 13 0.10% FLORIDA 11,462 1,022 8.90% GEORGIA 11,089 37 0.30% NEW YORK 10,768 1,696 15.80% NORTH CAROLINA 6,275 20 0.30% VIRGINIA 5,860 16 0.30% PENNSYLVANIA 5,382 171 3.20% COLORADO 5,268 804 15.30% * ICE did not assume custody and it recorded refusal by law enforcement agency (LEA) that was sent notice or detainer request. SOURCE: Report including Table 1, "Outcome of ICE I-247 Detainer Requests by State, FY 2014 - FY 2016," "Has Cooperation by State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies Improved ICE's Apprehension Numbers?," Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, August 12, 2016 In raw numbers, local agencies in California led the nation by a wide margin in refusals with 7,292 requests rebuffed. That total was followed by detainers refused by departments in New York (1,696 refusals); Florida (1,022); and Colorado (804), TRAC’s chart shows. Put another way, agencies in the four states accounted for 81 percent of detainers refused in the 50 states. Eight other states had 129 or more refused requests each, the chart shows. Put another way, a dozen states accounted for 96 percent of the detainer requests denied in the 50 states. At the low end, the chart shows a dozen states had 10 or fewer denied requests. We also looked at refusal rates by state. According to the chart, eight states led the nation with detainer refusal rates of 10 percent to nearly 16 percent (topped by agencies in New York and California). In contrast, local departments in 27 states including Texas had refusal rates of 2 percent or less, leaving eight states with refusal rates of 2.5 percent to nearly 9 percent. Another sheriff comments and mayor stands by claim For perspective outside Travis County, we reached Patrick Royal of the National Sheriffs’ Association who guided us to A.J. "Andy" Louderback, the sheriff for Jackson County, Texas, and legislative director of the Sheriffs’ Association of Texas. By phone, Louderback called Adler’s claim a misrepresentation because the vast majority of jurisdictions nationally didn’t deny detainer requests, especially those in Texas. We similarly shared the TRAC chart and our 50-state figures with Adler spokesman Jason Stanford who said by email: "For us, what the" mayor’s "statement means is that detainers without warrants are not accepted in many places around the country and that our sheriff is not alone (we continue to believe that is true)." Our ruling Adler said: "Local authorities in 43 states refused to honor more than 16,000 detainer requests from ICE from October 2013 to December 2015. Only in Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Vermont and Wyoming did local officials honor all requests, and detainers are relatively rare in those states." Adler’s figures trace to research based on ICE data, though our review of the figures suggests that fewer detainer requests might have been refused by local law enforcement agencies. Missing here too is that nearly all detainer requests were honored nationally and most of the tallied detainer refusals occurred in a handful of states. We rate this claim Mostly True.

This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article is rife with grammatical errors that almost bring it to the point of incomprehensibility. To start with, the headline references "50,000 African Student," singular, not 50,000 African students, plural. At one point, it declares, "The US Embassy will work emphatically through their specialists with understudies occasionally masterminded social events and courses to help them all through the application strategy to hook declaration and honors to go to schools and colleges in the United States." We searched on Nexis to see if any major news outlets reported on the news of Trump approving scholarships for African students, and could not find any evidence to support the headline’s claim.

pomt-05914	"A cashier earning $20,000 per year pays the same (Virginia) income tax rate as a hedge fund manager earning $20 million per year."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/01/david-englin/del-englin-says-cashier-and-rich-hedge-fund-manage/	Del. David Englin says Virginia’s tax code is "nonsensical" and in need of reform. In a Jan. 20 news release, the Alexandria Democrat said the code is fraught with exemptions and inefficient formulas for taxing gas, machinery and business receipts. And Englin said the state income tax is inequitable. "A cashier earning $20,000 per year pays the same (Virginia) income tax rate as a hedge fund manager earning $20 million a year," he said. Would that cashier and that multi-millionaire really shell out an equal percentage of their earnings in state income taxes? We checked. Englin backed his statement by pointing to a state law that applies a 5.75 percent levy on all taxable income over $17,000. But does that mean the hedge fund manager earning $20 million annually and the cashier earning one-thousandth of that amount would pay the same tax rate? The answer is no. That’s because everyone who pays Virginia income tax gets to claim certain deductions and exemptions. Joel Davison, a spokesman for the Virginia Department of Taxation, said those reductions would shrink our cashier’s income below the top threshold. Let’s take the example that would offer the fewest state tax advantages to our cashier: He or she is single, has $20,000 in wages with no other income or federal deductions. The worker could claim a $930 state personal exemption and a $3,000 standard deduction for a single tax filer, leaving him or her with $16,070 in Virginia taxable income. That means the cashier falls short of the $17,000 threshold for entry into Virginia’s top income tax rate of 5.75 percent, Davison said. The highest rate the worker would pay on any portion of his or her income would be 5 percent. Any other scenario would further reduce the cashier’s Virginia taxable income. Our worker, for example, could receive a $930 exemption for each dependent child. If the cashier is over 65, her or she would be entitled to a $12,000 deduction. To be fair, there is a scenario under which the hedge fund manager would owe no taxes in Virginia. For example, he or she could have cataclysmic business losses or multiple tax credits could lower the tax liability to zero. But Davison pointed out that such occurrences would be "unlikely." Englin made a mistake in the wording of his statement by focusing on the cashier’s gross pay. He told us in an email that he was referring to the rate on "Virginia taxable income" and that he was assuming, for the sake of argument, the cashier and the hedge fund manager had no deductions or credits. But this creates a new wrinkle. Even a cashier with taxable income of $20,000 would pay a lower overall rate than a multi-millionaire hedge fund manager. That’s because the first $17,000 of all Virginians’ taxable income is assessed below the top rate. Virginia imposes a levy of 2 percent on the first $3,000 of taxable income, then 3 percent on the next $2,000, and 5 percent on taxable earnings from $5,000 to $17,000. So the cashier with $20,000 in taxable earnings would pay the top 5.75 percent levy on the last $3,000 of that money, but lower rates on the rest. Overall, a person with $20,000 in Virginia taxable income would pay a "blended" tax rate of 4.5 percent, according to Ryan Losi, executive vice president at the Piascik and Associates accounting firm in Richmond. We also ran the numbers on the overall rate someone would pay if he or she had $30,000 in taxable income. It would be 4.9 percent. That would still be below the roughly 5.75 percent levy the hedge fund manager would pay on his or her $20 million income, since all but a minute portion of the earnings would be taxed at the top rate. Our ruling: Englin said a cashier earning $20,000 a year would pay the same Virginia tax rate as a hedge fund manager who makes $20 million annually. He’s wrong. Basic deductions and exemptions would lower the cashier’s taxable income to a level below the state’s top rate of 5.75 percent that the hedge fund manager would likely pay. Englin tells us he intended to say that a cashier with a Virginia taxable income of $20,000 would pay the same rate as the rich hedge fund manager. But in such a case, the worker’s overall state income tax rate would still be lower than the millionaire’s. We rate Englin’s statement False.

pomt-04027	"As a result of National Rifle Association and other private-sector (safety-education) programs, fatal firearms accidents are at the lowest level in 100 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/01/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-nra-says-fatal-firearms-accidents-a/	During a closely watched Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun policy on Jan. 31, 2013, National Rifle Association executive director Wayne LaPierre offered several statistics designed to bolster his group’s position against gun control. Here’s one claim that caught our eye: "Teaching safe and responsible gun ownership works, and the NRA has a long and proud history of doing exactly that," LaPierre said. "Our Eddie Eagle Child Safety Program has taught 25 million young people that if they see a gun, they should do four things: stop, don't touch it, leave the area, and call an adult. As a result of this and other private-sector programs, fatal firearms accidents are at the lowest level in 100 years." Let’s take a look at two parts of LaPierre’s comment -- the numerical claim that accidental shooting deaths have declined, and the question of whether NRA safety programs made a difference. Are "fatal firearms accidents … at the lowest level in 100 years"? To check this part of the claim, we turned to a massive compendium of data produced annually by the National Safety Council, a nonprofit, congressionally chartered organization. The group issues an annual report that includes a category called "unintentional injury deaths" -- with data going all the way back to 1903. The most recent version of the "Injury Facts" report available on the Internet is the 2011 edition, with data up to 2009. But we were able to obtain draft data from the council that offers preliminary data for as recently as 2011 (numbers that the group says are subject to refinement). According to council data, the total number of unintentional deaths from firearms sank to 554 in 2009 -- easily the lowest of any year back to 1903. In fact, it took from 1903 all the way until 1997 for the number of unintentional gunfire deaths to drop below 1,000. The all-time highs came in 1929 and 1930, when the number of such deaths reached 3,200 for two consecutive years. This decline is all the more striking considering the increase in population over this period. In 1904, there were 3.4 unintentional firearm deaths per 100,000 people. By 2009, that rate had fallen to 0.2 deaths per 100,000 in people. However, the data for unintentional gun deaths ticked up modestly in 2010, to 606, and then fell slightly to 600 in 2011. So LaPierre was very close to correct -- 2009 represented a record low, but the number was slightly higher in both 2010 and 2011, at least according to preliminary data. Did safety education programs by the National Rifle Association and other groups help reduce accidental gun deaths? In a 2004 paper in the journal Pediatrics, researchers studied two child-safety programs, including the NRA’s Eddie Eagle. They concluded that Eddie Eagle was "effective for teaching children to reproduce verbally the gun-safety message … but the skills were not used when the children were assessed via real-life" situations. (Separately, gun-control advocates have complained that the Eddie Eagle program, whatever its safety benefits, helps recruit new generations of children into the NRA’s approach to guns.) However, the study should be taken with a grain of salt: Pediatrics is published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, a group that, at the time the paper was published, was on record supporting "regulation of the manufacture, sale, purchase, ownership, and use of firearms; a ban on handguns and semiautomatic assault weapons; and expanded regulations of handguns for civilian use." (The group reaffirmed that position in 2012.) We did not hear back from the NRA for this story, but several independent experts said they feel the NRA programs and others like it probably did help contribute to the decline in accidental gun deaths. "I taught my children these same principles when they were very young so they had a way to evaluate the situation," said Mark E. Safarik, executive director of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. "If the gun safety course teaches those principles, then it has to have had an effect." Jay Corzine, a sociologist at the University of Central Florida, agreed that such programs probably made a difference. "Overall, I believe the NRA should be commended for its firearm safety programs," Corzine said. "It is a certain that they have prevented some accidental shootings and deaths." That said, Corzine cautioned against giving Eddie Eagle too much credit for the drop. Corzine pointed to a 2002 study in the journal Homicide Studies that suggested an entirely different rationale for the drop: improved medical care, particularly for trauma victims. The authors of that study wrote that "we have garnered considerable support for the hypothesis that advances in emergency medical care have greatly and increasingly reduced the lethality of violent assaults." In an interview, Billie Weiss, an epidemiologist at the UCLA School of Public Health, pointed to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., as an example of the advances in medical treatment. Giffords was shot in the head at a public gathering in January 2011. While she still faces a difficult road to recovery, Giffords survived the shooting. "Ten years ago, she most certainly would not have lived after her injury," Weiss said. To factor out improvements in trauma care, Corzine said it’s better to use a different data set than the one LaPierre used. Rather than focusing on accidental deaths from gunfire, Corzine said, look at accidental injuries from gunfire instead. The National Safety Council’s annual report doesn’t include such data, but the CDC makes it available. We found that unintentional gunfire injuries have also been declining -- by about 20 percent between 2001 and 2010. That’s somewhat slower than the decline in unintentional gunfire deaths over the same period, which was 24 percent. But it’s not dramatically different. (As with the figures for unintentional gunfire deaths, the number for unintentional gunfire injuries ticked up slightly in 2011.) What may be more relevant is that the incidents LaPierre cited -- unintentional deaths from gunfire -- only amounted to about 600 cases in 2010, compared to 14,161 cases of unintentional gunshot injuries that didn’t lead to death. In addition, there were 53,738 gunshot injuries caused by intentional assault in that year and another 4,643 non-fatal gunshot injuries caused by suicide attempts. In other words, the roughly 600 unintentional gunshot deaths LaPierre cited in his testimony accounts for only a tiny proportion of all gun-related deaths and injuries -- less than half of one percent, to be precise. Indeed, just looking at gunfire deaths, the trend lines for unintentional and intentional fatalities have been moving in opposite directions. Back in 1968, intentional gunfire deaths outpaced unintentional deaths by a ratio of 10 to 1. By 2009, that gap had expanded significantly, with intentional deaths exceeding unintentional deaths by a factor of more than 50 to 1. So while LaPierre worded his statistic carefully and in a way that was very close to accurate, he chose to focus on a tiny subset of gun-related harm while ignoring the vast majority of gun-related deaths. Our ruling LaPierre was very close to being right about his carefully framed statistic: Despite significant population growth, unintentional firearms deaths fell to a 106-year low in 2009 before tracking up slightly in 2010. But while LaPierre is probably right that NRA-sponsored safety programs played a role in this decline, improvements in trauma care -- something LaPierre didn’t cite -- likely played as big a role as well, if not a bigger role. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Wayne LaPierre	None	None	None	2013-02-01T12:53:46	2013-01-30	['None']
pomt-13740	Speakers at the Democratic National Convention made "zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-right-no-democratic-speaker-mentioned-isis-con/	Night one of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia had barely ended when the Republican National Committee sent a blast email to reporters attacking the Democrats for ignoring the threat of terrorism when speaking at the podium. "61: Number Of Speeches At The DNC Tonight," the Republican National Committee wrote. "0: Mentions Of The Global Terrorist Threat Posed By ISIS." Was the Democratic discussion of ISIS and Islamic terrorism that thin? Basically, yes. It’s worth noting that the first night was not intended to have a specific focus on foreign policy, leaving the Democrats with three days left to discuss the issue. And Hillary Clinton -- away from the podium in Philadelphia -- issued a fairly muscular call for action against ISIS at the annual Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Charlotte, N.C. "We have to protect ourselves against terrorists," Clinton told the group. "To do that, we need to lead other countries in stopping ISIS, al-Qaida, and other radical jihadist groups. We shouldn’t leave that to the rest of the world to figure out on their own. That won’t keep us safe." That said, as it concerns the convention in Philadelphia, the RNC’s statement is literally correct. Based on our searches of C-SPAN closed-captioning text, Congressional Quarterly transcripts and other video archiving services, we couldn’t find any speaker who mentioned "ISIS," "Islamic" "terror," "terrorist," or "terrorism" during the first day of the convention. The closest example came in a video that quoted Hillary Clinton’s speech after the mass shooting in Orlando in which a gunman who professed allegiance to ISIS attacked a gay nightclub. "From Stonewall to Laramie, and now Orlando, we've seen too many examples of how the struggle to live freely, openly and without fear has been met by violence. We have to stand together, be proud together. There is no better rebuke to the terrorists and all those who hate," she said. But that doesn’t really fit the description in the RNC’s email, since the email referred to speeches at the Democratic convention, not to video footage shown of Clinton’s past speeches. Our ruling The Republican National Committee said speakers at the Democratic National Convention made "zero mentions of the global terrorist threat posed by ISIS." While Clinton took the opportunity to bring up the topic at an appearance in Charlotte on the same day, the email accurately reflects what was said -- or more precisely, not said -- from the podium in Philadelphia. We rate the statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/77db633e-f189-4102-84a4-7274c28a931c	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2016-07-26T00:36:12	2016-07-25	['None']
pomt-04219	Says veterans’ disability claims backlog doubled in Obama’s first term.	true	/texas/statements/2012/nov/28/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-veterans-disability-claims-backlo/	In legislation filed this week, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn touts a Texas-tested method to address backlogged veterans’ disability claims, a problem he recently highlighted on Twitter. On Nov. 19, 2012, the Texas Republican tweeted, "Veterans' disability claims backlog had doubled during POTUS's first term. He needs to announce a plan to reduce it. ASAP." Reducing the Department of Veterans Affairs backlog was one of the campaign promises Barack Obama made in 2008 as he ran for POTUS (president of the United States). PolitiFact rated it a Promise Broken in a Nov. 2, 2012, article that delved into some of the reasons the problem had grown worse. The term "backlog" is used in this context as shorthand for claims that have gone unaddressed by the government for 125 days involving military veterans’ disability compensation and pensions and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die because of their military service. PolitiFact said the nationwide backlog "nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012," due in part to the influx of veterans returning from war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Texas’ backlog doubled from July 2010 to July 2012, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a July 16, 2012, news story. And the VA claims office in Waco has both the nation’s longest wait and the nation’s largest backlog, according to an Aug. 14, 2012, Statesman article and Cornyn’s Nov. 12, 2012, opinion column in the Waco Tribune-Herald. Cornyn’s legislation, according to his Nov. 28, 2012, press release, would require the VA to come up with a national plan similar to its recent partnership with the Texas Veterans’ Commission, which assists veterans with their claims individually. We asked Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie for details on the senator’s tweet about Obama’s first term, which began Jan. 20, 2009. His second term begins Jan. 21, 2013. Brandewie emailed us data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Looking at numbers from the department’s weekly reports, Brandewie said, there were 86,687 backlogged claims on Jan. 24, 2009, and 597,636 on Nov. 17, 2012. That, we calculated, is a 589 percent increase. But, Brandewie noted, there’s a hitch in those numbers. Before October 2009, he said, the VA considered a claim backlogged if it had gone unaddressed for more than 180 days. Then the department raised the bar. Beginning that month, a claim was backlogged if it had been pending for more than 125 days. That meant a lot of claims were immediately reclassified as backlogged. The agency’s Sept. 26, 2009, report has 88,195 claims older than 180 days; the next report, issued Oct. 3, 2009, has 158,290 claims pending for more than 125 days. We wondered if 180-day-late claims had doubled on Obama’s watch, but the VA reports stopped including that statistic after the 2009 change. As an alternative, we checked the longest span of days we could get with the 125-day measure -- Oct. 3, 2009 to Nov. 17, 2012. The result: a 278 percent increase. Veterans’ Affairs spokesman Randy Noller, whom we interviewed by phone, sent us data that matches the numbers Brandewie sent us. Brandewie also pointed out that the backlog had doubled in another way: as a percentage of the whole. Two years ago, less than a third of all such veterans’ claims were pending. Now, more than two-thirds of all claims are pending. Why did the backlog increase so much? Noller told us, "We’ve got more claims being filed now than ever before." PolitiFact said the VA added staff, but it wasn’t enough to keep up with a sharp increase in claims volume, much less reduce the past backlog. The undersecretary for the Veterans Benefits Administration, Allison Hickey, said the volume of claims rose 48 percent from 2008 through 2011 -- from 888,000 to 1.3 million -- in testimony to a U.S. House subcommittee July 18, 2012. That’s despite a decline in the number of veterans, which dropped about 6 percent in the same period -- from 23.4 million in 2008 to 22.2 million in 2011 by the department’s VetPop estimates and from 23.2 million in 2008 to 21.5 million in 2011 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Noller told us "ten years’ worth of war" in Iraq and Afghanistan is a large factor. Because of advances in technology and tactics, "more of our people are coming back alive," he said, and they report more medical conditions per person than their Vietnam and World War II predecessors. Those older veterans face additional problems of their own as they age, according to a Sept. 27, 2012, New York Times news story. "The department is administering pensions for World War II veterans while handling new claims from Vietnam veterans struggling with the multiplying ailments of age," the story said. In her testimony, Hickey said another major contributor to the backlog pile-up has been claims involving Agent Orange, a herbicide the U.S. sprayed to reduce vegetation providing enemy cover in Vietnam. The Aug. 4, 2012, Statesman news story said rules adopted in 2010 made it easier for Vietnam veterans to file claims based on post-traumatic stress disorder and exposure to Agent Orange. The Times story said that even though Veterans Affairs "added nearly 4,000 new workers since 2008, the agency did not keep pace." Our ruling Cornyn said the backlog of veterans’ claims doubled in Obama’s first term. Counting from Jan. 24, 2009, forward yields an increase of 589 percent. This is an overstatement, though, since the government lowered its threshold for declaring a claim as backlogged after Obama became president. Still, the backlog has tripled since the lower threshold was imposed in October 2009. We often find fault in claims that assign the responsibility for broad results to a particular officeholder. That’s because many factors are usually at play. In this instance, however, Obama promised to reduce the backlog of claims and PolitiFact recently rated this a promise Broken. In turn, we rate Cornyn’s statement as True.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2012-11-28T16:57:04	2012-11-19	['None']
pomt-12033	"Calling for the assassination of the president is a federal crime."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/15/william-lacy-clay/chappelle-nadals-statement-isnt-necessarily-federa/	Missouri State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, faced calls that she should resign after writing on Facebook "I hope Trump is assassinated!" in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Criticism of Chappelle-Nadal’s statement came from Republicans and Democrats, including U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis. "Calling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime. … (She is) an embarrassment to our state. She should resign immediately," Clay told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in an article published Aug. 18. On Wednesday, the Missouri Senate censured Chappelle-Nadal. The resolution reads, "Members of the Missouri Senate urge Senator Chappelle-Nadal to resign or, upon failure to do so, she may be subject to potential expulsion at a future session of the Missouri Senate." That’s a political decision. We wanted to know whether calling for the assassination of a president really is a federal crime. We reached out to Clay’s spokesman, Steven Engelhardt, who pointed us to a Wikipedia article on U.S. Code Title 18, Section 871, which states that "knowingly and willfully" threatening the president is a felony. While that is the law, after consulting with experts, we found it’s not quite as straightforward as Clay made it out to be. The context, wording and intent of the statement are all important factors to consider to determine whether the speaker committed a federal crime. History of the law Early versions of the law date back as far as 1351, with the British Treason Act. The act made it a crime to plan or imagine the death of the king of England. The United States is no stranger to presidential assassinations and attempts, which justifies the existence of the current law, said Ronald Feinman, author of the book, "Assassinations, Threats, and the American Presidency: From Andrew Jackson to Barack Obama." "One out of every 10 presidents has been killed, and one out of every seven has been wounded and about half of them have faced threats we know of," Feinman said. "So it is a endemic problem in America." Lyrissa Lidsky, dean of the MU School of Law, said threats have a "tremendously disruptive effect" and are considered outside the boundary of normal conflict in the political arena. "Threat laws are designed to, one, prevent the person who's making the threat from carrying out the threat," Lidsky said. "But another purpose is to prevent intimidation of the person who's threatened. So if a speaker says, 'I'm going to kill you,' chances are, your life will be seriously affected if you think someone has made a serious threat to kill you." The law has evolved, MU School of Law professor Frank Bowman said. "In 15th century England, this statement would surely be taken as a threat," Bowman said of Chappelle-Nadal’s comment. "Now the Secret Service has to do some triage to discover if a threat was made." Context matters While it is a crime to threaten to assassinate the president, Clay’s statement fails to consider the nuance needed to determine whether a statement is a true threat that would be deemed a crime. "It's an overstatement," Lidsky said of Clay’s claim. "You really have to look at the statement and discern what the speaker intended. Whether it was a joke, a jest, hyperbole or whether it was a serious intent to threaten the president." Other experts emphasized the importance of the statement’s language, context and tone when analyzing it. "The key word really is threat. Threat doesn’t just mean, 'I wish this would happen,'" Bowman said. The United States Supreme Court explicitly dealt with the issue in 1969 in Watts v. United States, when an 18-year-old man who disagreed with being drafted said, "If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L.B.J." The Supreme Court ruled that the man’s statement was "crude political hyperbole" that "did not constitute a knowing and willful threat against the President." Experts have stressed that social media complicates the problem. "A statement made on social media doesn't automatically have the same contextual clues as to the speaker's meaning as a statement made in person," Lidsky said. When it comes to free speech and what you can say or post on social media, there are limits, Feinman said. "You can condemn (the president), you can denounce him, but you don't have a right to call for his death, because that could incite others to commit violence," Feinman said. "I hope" vs. "I will" It’s unclear if Chappelle-Nadal’s statement was "calling for the assassination of the president," as Clay claimed. "Saying, 'I hope' is not the same thing as saying, 'Please someone go out and assassinate the president,’ " Lidksy said. "The very language of it itself means it's unlikely to be a threat, because she's not saying she's going to assassinate him, and she's not even calling for somebody to go out and assassinate him. It's a hope. And so therefore, that's unlikely to be a federal crime standing on its face." Experts said they thought it would be unlikely that Chappelle-Nadal would be prosecuted. At most, she could be investigated. Our ruling Clay said, "Calling for the assassination of the President is a federal crime." While calling for the assassination of a president can be a crime, context matters. Decisions need to be made on a case-by-case basis to determine if someone’s statement is a true threat with intent that could lead to prosecution. In Chappelle-Nadal’s case, experts agreed that her statement was more wishful thinking than incitement to assassinate the president. Therefore, Clay’s statement was missing important details and was an overgeneralization of the law. We rate it Half True.	None	William Lacy Clay	None	None	None	2017-09-15T11:44:41	2017-08-18	['None']
pomt-03970	"We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/14/barack-obama/obama-says-fuel-efficiency-has-doubled/	President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address that the country’s progress toward energy independence can be measured in miles per gallon. "Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. After years of talking about it, we're finally poised to control our own energy future," he said. "We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar, with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it." A lot of energy claims are packed in that statement. Here, we’ll examine whether we’ve "doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas." We reached out to the White House asking for backup to this claim but did not receive any. But back in 2011, the EPA announced a plan, in partnership with a dozen automakers, to increase average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks. (That figure represents a combined city/highway rating as tested in a lab. In real-world driving, the EPA estimates drivers would average closer to 43 mpg.) Is that for cars coming off the assembly line now? Not hardly. The 54.5 mpg benchmark is the goal for model year 2025 vehicles. Fuel efficiency is gradually increasing on the way to the 2025 goal. When he took office in 2009, federal standards called for an average rating of 27.5 mpg. For 2013 vehicles, the standard is 30.5 mpg. In 2016, it rises to 34.1. So comparing fuel efficiency in 2009 and now, there’s an increase of 11 percent -- not nearly double. Our ruling Obama said the U.S. has "doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas," which clearly sounds as though cars on the road today are running at twice their earlier fuel efficiency. But he was comparing a real number with a projected one, a standard for vehicles manufactured more than a decade from now. The statement was misleading and more importantly untrue. We rate it False.

pomt-08165	"The tuitions in Virginia colleges...have doubled -- 100 percent -- in the last 10 years."	true	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/02/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-college-tuitions-have-/	In a recent "Ask the Governor" session on WTOP radio, host Mark Segraves told Gov. Bob McDonnell that a Virginia Tech student had called to complain about the rising cost of tuition. "And he should," McDonnell responded. "I have a daughter at Virginia Tech and two (sons) at U.Va. right now and I’m saying I understand his pain. The tuitions in Virginia colleges, Mark, have doubled -- 100 percent -- in the last 10 years. It’s unacceptable." We won’t challenge the governor on where his children are enrolled, but we did wonder whether tuition at all state schools had doubled. McDonnell Press Secretary Stacey Johnson supported the claim with a July State Council of Higher Education for Virginia report. She pointed to a chart showing the average full-time in-state undergraduate tuition with mandatory teaching-related fees has risen from $2,192 in 2000-01 to $5,670 for 2010-11 -- significantly more than double. But we wondered if each public college and university had doubled its tuition over the decade. So, we turn back to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia’s report, which clearly shows that tuition and fees are on the rise. For 2010-11, all of the state’s 16 public schools show undergraduate tuition and mandatory teaching-related fees increasing by at least 5 percent from the previous year. Half of those increases are in the double digits, with Virginia Commonwealth University at the top of the list with a 23.9 percent hike from 2009-10. Old Dominion University had the smallest increase at 5.3 percent. Now, we need to see how things looked a decade ago. According to a 2000-01 State Council of Higher Education report, McDonnell’s claim still holds up if we look at all the state’s public four-year institutions. Only Richard Bland College -- a two-year junior college -- has not doubled its tuition, and even that school is only $256 shy of the mark. The only way McDonnell’s claim runs into trouble is if we look at tuition and all mandatory fees -- for non-instructional uses such as athletics and capital debt service. Even then, only two schools -- James Madison University and Old Dominion University -- have yet to double the 2000-01 figures, and both are short by less than $200. In case you’re curious, the average tuition including all mandatory fees and room and board for four-year state schools has risen from $8,813 in 2000-01 to $16,833 this year -- nearly double. Also of note: Tuition spiked sharply in fiscal 2002 after a tuition freeze instituted in fiscal 1997 was lifted. A mandatory tuition reduction was also implemented in fiscal 2000. "The freeze was lifted in Fiscal Year ‘02 because of budget cuts to higher education. That's when tuition and E&G (instructional) fees shot up by an average of 21.5 percent across the public institutions," said Kirsten Nelson with the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. More recent spikes were also caused by budget cuts. "The reasons they have gone up fairly substantially in the past couple years is because they’ve suffered budget cuts from the General Assembly," Nelson said. "One of the reasons that higher education gets cut is because the institutions have an alternate source of income, which is tuition." Nelson said things could have been worse were it not for the almost $275 million state colleges and universities received from the 2009 Stimulus Act. Now, let’s review: McDonnell’s claim that Virginia tuition has doubled in the last 10 years is 100 percent true using the average. If we look individually at each of the state’s four-year schools, it’s still true. Only if we include Richard Bland, the state’s only two-year junior college, is it not entirely true to say that all state colleges and universities have doubled tuition, but even then it’s off just a tad. So we find the claim to be True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2010-12-02T11:35:22	2010-11-30	['Virginia']
pomt-02598	"Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days."	false	/florida/statements/2014/jan/27/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-it-takes-two-days-get-environmenta/	Gov. Rick Scott, who has drawn criticism from environmentalists for his strongly pro-business policies, this week called for an increase in spending for conservation projects on waterways and in the Everglades. At a Jan. 21, 2014, event in Tallahassee to honor 125 Department of Environmental Protection employees, Scott announced a budget request that includes efforts to protect and restore springs. He then made a statement praising the speed at which such employees work: "Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days. That’s great." In a press gaggle following the event, DEP Secretary Herschel Vinyard Jr. -- a Scott appointee -- was asked about that two-day timetable. He didn’t back up his boss: "We're actually at about 32, 33 days is our average permit processing time. So I'm not exactly sure what was mentioned," Vinyard said. (Tampa Bay Times reporter Steve Bousquet was at the press gaggle and recorded the comments. We also confirmed Scott’s comments in his written prepared remarks.) Once we started digging, it became clear that Scott was talking about an entirely different type of permit. Let’s go deep into the weeds to discern the differences between these two types of permits. Permitting process at two state agencies There is a license that takes on average two days to obtain -- but it’s not an environmental permit. "Under Gov. Scott’s administration, the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation has reduced professional license processing time by more than 60 percent from an average of six days to two days," said Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz in an email. Those professional licenses are for a range of jobs including auctioneers, hair braiders, geologists, realtors and veterinarians. For these permits, it now takes two days to process the application. In some instances, applicants have to complete other steps -- for example, to pass an exam or receive board certification, said Department of Business and Professional Regulation spokeswoman Tajiana Ancora-Brown. It takes longer to process an environmental permit, though the lag time has dropped. It took the Department of Environmental Protection 87.7 days in 2010-11 to produce permits. It’s now 33.7 days on average. This covers permits related to waste, water and air. Typically, the applicants seeking such permits are businesses, though on occasion, homeowners may apply, too. For instance, a resident who wants to build on a wetland on their property would have to file an application, said Patrick Gillespie, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. Officials for both the Department of Business and Professional Regulation and the Department of Environmental Protection told us they had sped up the process in part by emphasizing online applications. At DEP, they also added a "pre-application meeting" for applicants to go over the regulations and reduce the chance their application would arrive incomplete. In 2012, Scott signed a bill that reduced the amount of time to approve certain permits -- for example wetlands permits -- from 90 days to 60 days, earning kudos from business groups. In December 2012, DEP employees who improved customer service including speeding up the permitting process received bonuses. But environmentalists have raised concerns. While the department found more than $500,000 for bonuses, it also laid off 58 employees. State Rep. Mark Pafford, D-West Palm Beach, told the Tampa Bay Times that the bonuses sent the wrong message to employees. "You’re arguably providing an incentive to turn your head," Pafford said. "You’re giving someone a bonus for them not to take the time required when reviewing permits. That’s dangerous for an agency called the Department of Environmental Protection." Our ruling Scott said, "Recently, Florida has successfully reduced the environmental permitting time down to just two days." Scott was mistaken; he was actually referring to the amount of time it takes to get a professional license from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. During Scott’s tenure, the state has reduced the amount of time it takes to get an environmental permit to about 34 days. However, what he said was incorrect. We rate his claim False.

pomt-06714	Says President Barack Obama delivered $2 billion to Brazil to help with offshore drilling projects.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/01/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-delivered-2-billion-brazil-h/	On the day he entered the Republican campaign for president, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said at a New Hampshire house party that the Obama administration has made life more difficult for oil companies in Louisiana and Texas while being overly generous to energy projects in other countries. "This president goes to Brazil and delivers $2 billion to that country to help them with their offshore drilling projects," Perry said. "What are they thinking?" But as we drilled down into this statement, we found an empty well. Obama didn't "deliver" any such thing during his visit to Brazil, and Obama had no connection to a much smaller loan guarantee that a Brazilian company ultimately got from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Experts we interviewed said Perry was distorting the truth and wrongly characterizing what happened. We tried to contact the Perry campaign, but it did not return calls or e-mails asking for supporting evidence of this statement. We found Perry is referring to two things: Obama's trip to Brazil in March 2011, which was intended to encourage growing economic and political ties to the country, and a decision by the Ex-Im Bank, an independent agency, to offer a preliminary commitment to a Brazilian oil company in April 2009. We'll take them one at a time. Obama's trip to Brazil On March 19, 2011, Obama met with Brazil’s new President Dilma Rousseff, hailed Brazil as an emerging "global leader" and talked of a bright future of cooperation between the two countries. Several times in his visit, Obama expressed support for increased trade and partnerships with Brazil. He mentioned building infrastructure for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics and developing biofuel technology. And several times, Obama said that the U.S. wanted to help Brazil develop its recently discovered deepwater oil reserves so the U.S. could be a customer. At a business summit in Brasilia, Obama said: "At a time when we’ve been reminded how easily instability in other parts of the world can affect the price of oil, the United States could not be happier with the potential for a new, stable source of energy." In an address at the Palacio do Planalto, he said: "In particular, with the new oil finds off Brazil, President Rousseff has said that Brazil wants to be a major supplier of new stable sources of energy, and I’ve told her that the United States wants to be a major customer, which would be a win-win for both our countries." But while Obama said that the U.S. would be a customer for the country's oil, he said nothing about the U.S. providing the $2 billion, as Perry claimed. Indeed, the action by the Ex-Im Bank involving the Brazilian oil company actually occurred in April 2009, almost two years before Obama's trip. It was approved by bank officials who all were appointees of President George W. Bush. Bush appointees approved $2 billion deal Perry's claim that Obama gave Brazil $2 billion echoes criticism we found in many blogs, many of which referred to a Wall Street Journal editorial written in August 2009, titled "Obama Underwrites Offshore Drilling." The editorial correctly reported that the U.S. Export-Import Bank agreed to a "preliminary commitment" for $2 billion with the Brazilian oil company Petrobras in 2009. But from there, the waters turned a bit muckier as the editorial held Obama responsible for that development. "Americans are right to wonder why Mr. Obama is underwriting in Brazil what he won't allow at home," the editorial concluded. First, a quick explanation of the Ex-Im Bank: It is an independent federal agency that provides financing options -- including direct loans, guarantees of loans and export-credit insurance -- to foreign buyers to help them buy U.S. goods and services, according to its website. When we called the Ex-Im Bank’s spokesman Phil Cogan, we could hardly get the question out about Obama's involvement before he interjected. "Not true," Cogan said. This much is true -- the bank agreed to a preliminary commitment with Petrobras in 2009 for $2 billion. That commitment, in lay terms, was "an expression of the bank’s willingness to consider an application of loans," Cogan said. But Obama had no role in approving it. When the bank’s board of directors made that decision on April 14, 2009, all five directors were appointed by Bush. Obama had no appointees on the board at that time. And it's important to understand that, according to the bank’s charter, the Ex-Im Bank is an independent credit agency. The president appoints the directors to the five-person board -- three of the president’s party, two of the minority party -- but does not vote on or sign off on transactions, Cogan said. For transactions exceeding $100 million, there is a 30-day review period, during which the president and members of Congress can comment on proposed transactions, Cogan said. But it’s very rare to receive comments, and the ultimate decision is made by the bank’s board of directors. The Ex-Im Bank receives its spending authority from Congress, but it gets no appropriated funds, Cogan said. It operates using revenue from the fees and interest that it charges lenders and borrowers. "In those rare cases when it makes direct loans (the majority of our financing is guarantees of loans made by commercial lenders), the bank borrows the money from Treasury, collects fees and charges interest to the ultimate borrower and repays Treasury both principal and interest," Cogan explained. On Feb. 4, 2010, the Ex-Im Bank agreed to a $308 million loan guarantee (out of the initial $2 billion commitment) with Petrobras, essentially guaranteeing prevention of default on a private loan from the lender, which in this case was JPMorgan Chase. The vote on that $308 million was not unanimous. Chairman Fred Hochberg, the only Obama appointee at that time, and director Diane Farrell voted for it; director Bijan Kian opposed it. They were the only directors that voted. In an e-mail, Petrobras officials confirmed that the loan has been signed and the money will be used to buy U.S. goods and services. According to the Ex-Im Bank, the companies that will benefit include three companies based in Louisiana -- and at least five companies in Perry’s home state of Texas. No evidence of an Obama connection So far, there's no evidence to support Perry's case that Obama delivered the loan guarantee. But is it possible the bank was under White House pressure to act? That's not how the place works, said Joseph Grandmaison, an international trade consultant who lives in Rye, N.H. Grandmaison was appointed by Bush to serve on the Ex-Im Bank’s board of directors for seven years, ending his term in July 2009. "In all the time I was there, to the best of my knowledge, there were never any calls from the White House to persuade us of anything," said Grandmaison, a Democrat. "They don’t influence transactions." That $2 billion preliminary commitment was tantamount to "establishing a line of credit" to Petrobras for the purpose of buying American goods. It was also intended to encourage U.S. companies to sell to Petrobras, Grandmaison said, because the financing was in place. Oliver O'Connell, an analyst who follows the Ex-Im Bank as editor of Trade Finance Magazine, agrees. "The idea that the president was somehow involved in this is a fallacy," O'Connell said. "This was about the Ex-Im Bank making sure that U.S. exporters could compete on the same level playing field as their foreign competitors, with the intention of creating American jobs." It’s a resilient fallacy, though, one that keeps popping up, from the Wall Street Journal to Fox News, going viral in emails and landing on various conservative blogs. It’s been enough to encourage the Ex-Im Bank to post a fact sheet on its website in attempt to shoot down the various charges. Addressing the claim that the loan represents a reversal of the Obama administration’s stance on offshore drilling, the fact sheet states: "There is no connection between federal policies on offshore drilling in U.S. waters and financing U.S. export sales for drilling by other countries. In fact, should Ex-Im Bank refuse to finance sales by U.S. companies it is likely that the sales will go instead to their foreign competitors." Cogan could not keep exasperation out of his voice when discussing the matter. "There have been so many errors and misconceptions about this," he said. "It keeps getting repeated and repeated, despite the facts." Our Ruling Perry’s claim is wrong in several ways. First, the number is wrong. Although there was an initial commitment for $2 billion, it ultimately became a $308 million loan guarantee. Second, Perry ignores that the Ex-Im Bank is an independent federal agency, and he is wrong to attribute its actions to Obama. The initial commitment came when it was controlled by Bush appointees. And although the Obama appointee voted for the $308 million loan guarantee, there is no evidence that it done at the behest of Obama. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05527	Mayor Tom Barrett’s policies drove unemployment up 27 percent in Milwaukee, pushing it to "one of America’s 10 worst cities for unemployment."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/11/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-mayor-tom-ba/	When PolitiFact Wisconsin Googled "Tom Barrett" the other day, top results included: A WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) story about Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s bid to take on Scott Walker in the 2012 recall race. A post on an education technology blog by a guy named Tom Barrett in Nottingham, England with 20,000 Twitter followers. Mayor Tom Barrett’s Wikipedia entry; his newly minted gubernatorial campaign website; and his official City Hall site (he was re-elected mayor on April 3, 2012). That’s in real life. In a campaign TV ad released March 29, 2012 by an arm of the Republican Governors Association, less neutral results appear as a woman searches on "Tom Barrett." In the ad, the woman gets these search hints: "Politician. Increase spending. High unemployment. Candidate for governor." As she "finds" some Barrett material online, she offers a running commentary. "Tom Barrett increased spending in Milwaukee by $300 million? Huh. "Raised taxes every year but one. Uh oh." "And what did his taxes and spending do to the economy? Unemployment up 27 percent. Under Barrett, Milwaukee’s one of America’s 10 worst cities for unemployment." She concludes: "Spending -- up. Taxes -- up. Unemployment -- up. Governor Tom Barrett? I don’t think so." The RGA ad claims on taxing and spending are not in dispute. But did unemployment jump 27 percent during Barrett’s first two terms, spanning 2004 to 2012? And was Milwaukee one of the toughest places in the United States for employment? We decided to investigate both -- and the ad’s claim Barrett’s policies were responsible. Unemployment rates are reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and state agencies such as the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development. We found a 26 percent increase in the number of unemployed from April 2004, when Barrett took office, to January 2012, according to the latest figures reported on the BLS site. The number is 27 percent if you do the math on the unemployment rates for those years (8.1 percent and 10.3 percent), though such comparisons are usually expressed as percentage point changes. In other words, you would typically say unemployment went up 2.2 percentage points under Barrett. But either way the RGA is pretty much on target on that piece. On the second part of the RGA claim, a top-10-worst ranking, the group’s spokesman pointed to 2005 -2007, when Milwaukee was sixth-highest for unemployment rate among large cities and to 2009, when the city was 10th. The RGA uses the nation’s 50 largest cities as a pool of comparison. If you expand to municipalities of any size, Milwaukee improves hundreds of places in the rankings. But it seems reasonable to compare Milwaukee, which is near the middle of the 50 largest cities, to its peer group. So it’s clear the city was in the top 10 for highest unemployment in four of Barrett’s first five full years in office. But what about 2008, and the most recent two years, 2010 and 2011? Milwaukee improved to 16th in 2008, and ranked 11th in 2010, when six California cities were among the worst. (The annual average for 2011 was not available as of early April 2012.) So the city’s ranking has edged out of the top 10 worst in three recent years under Barrett. One note: the TV ad subtly makes two different claims on the "top 10" ranking. The on-screen graphic says Milwaukee "was" one of the worst 10, while the narrator says that "Milwaukee’s one of America’s worst" -- a line that suggests the top-10 ranking is current. But either way the claim of a top-10 ranking is accurate or very close in five of the seven full years under Barrett. But the claim is about more than numbers. It places the blame squarely on Barrett and his policies ("what did his taxes and spending do to the economy?" asks the ad). Mayors clearly have a policy role on job creation, but state and national trends drive much of the employment picture at the local level. By the RGA’s logic, Scott Walker, as much as Barrett, could be accused of causing unemployment to soar when he was the elected executive of Milwaukee County, which includes the city of Milwaukee. Why? Because both Barrett’s and Walker’s eighth budgets included spending that was more than 30 percent higher than the budgets they inherited. (We used eight budgets for an apples-to-apples comparison; Barrett has submitted eight budgets; Walker did nine.) Separately, property taxes went up 20 percent over Walker’s first eight years, compared with 25 percent under Barrett. (Note: Walker never proposed a tax hike but used County Board levy increases as his base the following year). Our conclusion The Republican Governors Association, which backs Scott Walker, was basically accurate on its claims, but overstates the influence of a mayor on taming unemployment. This comes in Half True.	None	Republican Governors Association	None	None	None	2012-04-11T09:00:00	2012-04-29	['Milwaukee', 'United_States', 'Tom_Barrett_(politician)']
pomt-08907	"There are more pain clinics in Broward County than there are McDonald's in Broward County."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/29/dave-aronberg/aronberg-says-broward-pain-clinics-outnumber-mcdon/	The proliferation of pain clinics in Florida has been a growing problem -- particularly in Broward County. Dave Aronberg, a state senator from Palm Beach County running in the Democratic primary for attorney general, has now quantified that problem by comparing it to the availability of Big Macs. "There are more pain clinics in Broward County than there are McDonald's in Broward County," he told the St. Petersburg Times editorial board July 26. We at PolitiFact Florida wondered, are there really more spots to buy happy meds than Happy Meals in Broward County? Determining the number of pain clinics was more complicated than counting the number of McDonald's restaurants. Aronberg campaign spokesman Allison North Jones cited a grand jury investigation led by Broward State Attorney Mike Satz issued in 2009. That report stated that in 2007, there were four pain clinics in Broward. From August 2008 to November 2009, the number swelled from 47 to 115. A footnote in the report states that the statistic comes from the Broward Sheriff's Office Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit. BSO spokesman Jim Leljedal told us that as of July 28, BSO lists 144 pain clinics in the entire county. But he warned "sometimes it is hard to have an accurate count because these places come and go, they are thrown out of one storefront and move across the street." Aronberg sent us a March 2 blog in the Broward Palm Beach New Times which also looked at his McDonald's comparison -- that time he had made the comment at a St. Petersburg debate. "After dozens of phone calls and hours of research, it turns out that finding the exact number of pill mills in Broward is impossible," The New Times wrote. "First, it depends on your definition of a 'pill mill.' The pain management clinics in South Florida range from legitimate medical business targeting specific patients suffering chronic pain to junkie-friendly, low-rent operations. Second, a lot of these clinics open and shut down quickly, only to reopen at a new location. Third, and most important, there is little government regulation of the industry, no agency responsible for tracking the businesses." The New Times quoted Mike Jachles, a BSO spokesman, as saying there were "at least 80" in areas that BSO oversees. The New Times counted 71 McDonald's for Broward County in the phone book. We also consulted the Florida Department of Health's pain clinic registry. That spreadsheet shows about 343 clinics in Broward, but it lists several with the same addresses multiple times, making it difficult to get an accurate account. We called and e-mailed the health department's communications office in Tallahassee and did not hear back. Two other law enforcement agencies quoted in the past regarding the number of pain clinics -- the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Hollywood Police Department -- referred us to the health department. Next we tried to identify the number of McDonald's restaurants in Broward County. We e-mailed and called McDonald's media relations and after two days of no response, we typed all 31 cities in Broward into the chain's online restaurant locator. We found 73. Aronberg's Senate staff had done the same earlier this year, and found 78. (PolitiFact Florida came up with a different figure than Aronberg's team for Davie, Miramar and Pompano Beach. It's possible that some restaurants have opened and closed since Aronberg's office counted them.) We could not detemine a way to check unincorporated Broward on the McDonald's website. But there is little unincorporated land left so it's unlikely that would change the total significantly, if at all. So how is Aronberg's math? A grand jury report put the number of pain clinics at 115 by late 2009. The Broward Sheriff's Office puts the number at 144 as of July 28. We found the state health department database too confusing to evaluate, and no one to answer our questions. The best number we could determine for McDonald's locations was 73 -- Aronberg's campaign put it at 78 while the New Times said 71. No matter which number you pick, the number of pain clinics in Broward is dozens higher than the number of McDonald's. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04312	Bill Clinton presided over "the biggest expansion of the American economy since World War II."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/29/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-bill-clinton-presided-over-biggest-/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen says he’s a better job creator than Tim Kaine, his Democrat opponent. At just about every appearance, Allen accurately says that Virginia gained 300,000 jobs when he was governor from 1994 to 1998 and lost 100,000 when Kaine led the state from 2006 to 2010. Kaine addressed that argument during an Oct. 18 debate, noting that he governed during a deep national recession. He told Allen, "You were governor during the Clinton boom years, the biggest expansion of the American economy since World War II." Was there really record economic growth under Bill Clinton’s presidency from 1993 to 2001? We took a look. Kaine’s campaign cited two sources to back the claim: a Forbes magazine ranking from 2004 and an historic chart of the nation’s annual gross domestic product -- the market value of all goods and services produced -- from 1945 to 2000. Forbes created a scale to measure "prosperity" under the 10 presidents from Harry Truman through Clinton. It ranked them on six measures of economic performance: GDP growth, real disposable personal income, employment, unemployment, inflation and deficit reduction. Clinton topped the overall ranking, averaging 3.2. Lyndon B. Johnson came in second, averaging 3.7. He was followed, in order, by John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Truman, Richard Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush, who ranked an average of 8.5. Forbes’ prosperity scale certainly points to good economic years under Clinton. But economic growth, as defined by the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Modern Economics, is measured by changes in GDP. So let’s look at the GDP chart Kaine’s campaign sent, which was adjusted for inflation by using 2005 real dollars. It showed GDP during Clinton’s terms grew from $8.5 trillion in 1993 to $11.2 trillion in 2000. The $2.7 trillion increase was by far the largest under any postwar president. Here’s the ranking of postwar presidents based on GDP growth during their terms that is adjusted to 2005 dollars. We should note that the figures for Barack Obama are from 2009-2011 because annual GDP totals for 2012 are not available. 1. Clinton, 1993-2001, $2.7 trillion. 2. George W. Bush, 2001-2009, $1.7 trillion. 3. Reagan, 1981-1989, $1.6 trillion. 4. Johnson, 1963-1969, $741 billion. 5. Nixon, 1969-1974, $628 billion. 6. Eisenhower, 1953-1961, $484 billion. 7. Carter, 1977-1981, $461 billion. 8. George H.W. Bush, 1989-1993, $401 billion. 9. Obama, 2009-2012, $325 billion. 10. Kennedy, 1961-1963, $310 billion. 11. Ford, 1974-1977, $261 billion. 12. Truman, 1945-1943, $231 billion. But there are a few quirks to this method of cumulative comparison. With the exception of Truman -- who presided during a major reshuffling of the economy at the end of World War II -- the presidents at the top of the GDP list served two terms and those at the bottom served one term or less. And among the two-term presidents, the comparison favors those who served 35 years or more after the war -- Clinton, George W. Bush and and Reagan -- over those who served in its near aftermath -- Truman and Eisenhower. That’s because the GDP, even when adjusted for inflation, has steadily grown and today is more than five times greater than it was at the end of World War II. So, what’s the best way to compare economic expansion under presidents? Economists told us it’s best to measure the average annual rate of real GDP growth in constant dollars. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, ran the calculations for us, starting with the year each president entered office and ending with the year he left. Here’s the ranking of postwar presidents by the annual rate of real GDP growth in inflation-adjusted dollars during their terms. 1. Johnson, 5.2 percent. 2. Kennedy, 4.2 percent. 3. Clinton, 3.9 percent. 4. Reagan, 3.4 percent 5. Carter, 3.2 percent. 6. Eisenhower, 2.9 percent. 7. Nixon, 2.8 percent. 8. Ford, 2.5 percent. 9. George H.W. Bush, 2.1 percent. 10. George W. Bush, 2 percent. 11. Truman, 1.2 percent. 12. Obama, 0.3 percent. Our ruling Kaine said that Clinton presided over "the biggest expansion of the American economy since World War II." He backs his statement by offering a 2004 "prosperity" rating created by Forbes magazine that put Clinton at the top of postwar presidents. Kaine also cites the gross GDP growth, adjusted for inflation, over the administration of each president since 1945 -- a measure that favors recent two-term presidents. A different picture emerges when we use a comparison measure preferred by economists that measures annual average growth in the GDP. Among postwar presidents, LBJ was tops in economic expansion, followed by Kennedy. Clinton was third. There’s no doubt Clinton presided during a strong economic expansion, but not all indicators point to it being a postwar record. We rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-12003	The GOP’s health bill will protect people with pre-existing conditions "every bit as well as Obamacare did."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/22/ron-johnson/graham-cassidy-gop-alternative-obamacare-weakens-p/	How the latest GOP alternative to Obamacare would treat pre-existing conditions is a question repeatedly put to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who is one of the lead co-sponsors of the bill. On Sept. 20, 2017 -- 10 days before a deadline to pass the measure with a simple majority -- there was this exchange between Johnson and Chuck Todd, host of MSNBC’s "MTP Daily" talk show: Todd: "So, you contend that this bill will protect those folks with pre-existing conditions -- period." Johnson: "Every bit as well as Obamacare did. And it’s also going to protect the individuals that can’t afford Obamacare right now." The protections are a major point of contention. The Affordable Care Act makes it illegal for insurers to deny coverage to people who have pre-existing health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes or cancer, or charge them higher rates. But under the Johnson-sponsored plan, waivers that would give states new flexibility erode protections for pre-existing conditions. "The only way people (with pre-existing conditions) are protected is if every state in the nation looks at this and says, ‘We’re not going to do that,’" said Karen Pollitz, a health reform and private insurance expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. "This lets states take away your protections." The bill The bill, introduced a week before Johnson’s interview, is known as the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill (or its shorter moniker, Graham-Cassidy). That’s for the GOP senators co-sponsoring the measure: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Dean Heller of Nevada and Johnson. Under Senate rules, the bill could be approved with 51 votes (50 senators plus a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence) if it is adopted by Sept. 30, 2017. After that, Republicans, who hold 52 seats, would need 60 votes, which seems an impossibility. (On Sept. 22, 2017, with eight days left before the deadline, Arizona’s John McCain said he would join two other Senate Republicans who have indicated they would not vote for the bill, potentially dooming its chances.) The bill and pre-existing conditions got heavy attention after late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel, whose infant son was born with a congenital heart disease, attacked it on his show the night before Johnson’s interview. (Johnson has also noted in defending the bill that his adult daughter was born with a pre-existing condition.) How it treats pre-existing conditions The bill keeps the Affordable Care Act prohibition on insurers denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would enable them to opt out of other ACA provisions that protect those people. The upshot: States could allow insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions more than they charge healthy people; and the insurers could offer policies that offer less than the "essential benefits" that are now mandated. PolitiFact National rated Mostly False a claim by President Donald Trump that the bill includes "coverage of pre-existing conditions," finding that: If a state merely says it "intends to maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions," then it can allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones. The federal government could withhold money granted to a state under a waiver if the state doesn’t do as it promised, but the words "adequate" and "affordable" are open to interpretation. Policies would not have to provide the same level of coverage now mandated under Obamacare. Estimates say about 34 states would see net funding cuts under the bill. It costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it. Johnson's claim goes further than Trump’s, saying the bill’s pre-existing protections are as good as Obamacare’s. But in reviewing the GOP bill, the political news website Axios arrived at similar findings: The funding cuts "could pressure states to waive protections for sick people as a way to keep premium increases in check. Older, sicker people in every state could end up paying more as states try to make up for a funding shortfall." States could get a waiver to let insurers charge sick people more than healthy people. A waiver would exempt insurers from the current requirement to provide "essential health benefits," including prescription drugs -- so, people who need expensive drugs might have to pay out of pocket. And Pollitz told us that states could also allow insurance companies to: Charge lower premiums to people while they’re healthy, but then raise the rates at renewal time if, for example, they get cancer. Charge higher premiums based on a person’s location or occupation, practices that are outlawed under Obamacare. Information from the bill’s sponsors say it would protect people with pre-existing conditions, but doesn’t provide details. Patrick McIlheran, a Johnson spokesman, told us the bill gives states the flexibility to try "new approaches to keeping insurance for those with pre-existing conditions affordable." Before we close, it’s worth noting: Writing about the bill in the conservative National Review, Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, made one reference to pre-existing conditions, saying: On the positive side, supporters of the legislation correctly point out that it would give the states far more flexibility with the funds they receive, and would allow them to waive many of Obamacare’s more onerous regulations, including the mandate to buy coverage, mandated benefits and pre-existing-condition coverage requirements. Those are the regulations most responsible for driving up premiums and destabilizing insurance markets. Our rating Johnson said the GOP health bill he is co-sponsoring will protect people with pre-existing conditions "every bit as well as Obamacare did." The bill would keep the Affordable Care Act’s prohibition on denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions. But states could obtain waivers that would allow insurers -- unlike under Obamacare -- to charge people with pre-existing conditions premiums and provide them lesser benefits. We rate Johnson’s statement False.

pomt-01078	The streetcar project planned by Mayor Tom Barrett would be a "1900s style trolley."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/16/jim-steineke/rep-jim-steineke-says-milwaukee-streetcar-would-be/	Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s plan to move ahead with a $123.9 million downtown streetcar project -- which is approaching an important vote at the Common Council -- has drawn strong reactions from opponents who want to force a citywide vote. Republicans in Madison have joined the criticism, including Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, who linked spending on the the streetcar to possible public financing for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena. "Mayor Barrett, if you have $120 mil to pay for a 1900's style trolley, you certainly don't need state tax $ for a #Bucks arena," Steineke, a Kaukauna Republican, said in a tweet. When we asked Steineke to elaborate beyond 140 characters, he returned to the theme that the streetcars are outdated technology -- akin to the network Milwaukee had for nearly 100 years until the last route ran in the 1950s. "Back then they were not for the yuppie entertainment around in the downtown parts of the city," Steineke said. "We moved away from fixed-rail streetcars 50 years ago as a country." He continued: "Obviously there would be more modern cars and electric systems … but the style of transportation remains consistent." Of course, Barrett isn’t suggesting putting the city’s old streetcar system back into service. The mayor supports a $123.9 million 2.1 mile system, with an 0.4 mile extension to the lake. The Common Council is expected to vote on the proposal Jan. 21, 2015. "Studies and public statements by Milwaukee developers show that a fixed-rail line will encourage development because of the route’s permanence and the transportation alternative it provides," according to an overview of the project prepared by City Engineer Jeff Polenske. Critics counter that it simply takes development away from other areas that are not on the street car line, and that city residents would be better served by an improved bus system with the flexibility to readily change routes. So how would the new system compare with the old? Is Steineke right that the project is an outdated form of transportation? Let’s look at three aspects of the modern streetcar proposal and see how they compare with the city’s previous system. Route and service area Barrett wants a "starter system" based downtown. It would allow for connections to other neighborhoods and -- someday -- destinations far beyond the downtown area such as the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center, Miller Park, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the airport. The previous system began in 1860 with a small network of horse-drawn cars. Those lines eventually grew into a large network powered by electricity. The streetcar became an important part of the city’s fabric -- and the foundation for the city’s electric utility. In terms of routes, it looked more like the current Milwaukee County bus system. In the streetcar’s heyday, Milwaukee had a network of 15 to 20 lines that hauled workers to factories and families to picnics. But ridership declines began in the 1920s as cars became more popular, and after financial troubles the system ceased operation in 1958. So, in terms of scope, the new plan would be much smaller than the old system. But Barrett does have expansion plans in mind. Vehicles Obviously, the new streetcars are …new, compared with those from the past century. They’re air conditioned and quieter, with a "sleek modern look," the city says. The city also notes that the modern system would include "real time technology" that tells riders when the next car is arriving. In addition, the cars would be fully accessible to the disabled and carry more people than the older cars. "In general, describing the proposed system as ‘1900s style’ is accurate but disingenuous," said local historian John Gurda, who has written extensively about the old streetcar system. "Yes, the cars would follow fixed routes on steel rails, like their predecessors, but so do passenger trains. In both cases, the rolling stock of today is markedly different from what our ancestors knew." So, Steineke’s claim is accurate in terms of using fixed rails, but what would run on them would be much different than your grandparents’ streetcar. Old technology vs. new popularity Around the country, there’s a streetcar renaissance of sorts underway. Systems operate in at least seven U.S. cities and the Washington Post reported Nov. 30, 2014 that six systems are under construction, with two others -- Milwaukee and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. -- in the planning stages. (Not included in that list is Kenosha, the only Wisconsin city with streetcars. That city’s two-mile loop features vintage cars on rails and is aimed at tourists, with links to museums, the downtown and harbor.) Plans to build new streetcar systems have run into opposition in some areas, including Washington, D.C., where the system has been scaled back from 37 miles to about eight. The Post noted concerns that "streetcars can gum up, and get caught in, already busy traffic lanes. In nearby Arlington, Va., public skepticism of the high cost and uncertain benefit of a streetcar line caused officials to cancel an entire project" in November 2014. On the other hand, the system in Portland has expanded five times and now covers eight miles, and Seattle is adding a second route and planning a third. On this point, Steineke is perhaps the most off. There has been a recent burst of streetcar systems, which suggests they are returning in popularity -- not consigned to the history books. Our rating Steineke criticized plans for a new Milwaukee streetcar system, saying the project was a "1900s style trolley." His Twitter followers may not be following the project closely, but Steineke certainly knows Barrett isn’t planning a nostalgic system with old-time or refurbished cars. The city sees the streetcar as a modern transportation system, a building block that could lead to future economic growth. In theory, it’s a catalyst rather than a throwback. And at least some other cities see streetcars in the same light. We rate Steineke’s claim Half True.	None	Jim Steineke	None	None	None	2015-01-16T05:00:00	2014-11-19	['Tom_Barrett_(politician)']

Charlie Crist to President Barack Obama. Rubio, the former state House speaker and Republican frontrunner for the U.S. Senate, has played and replayed images of Crist hugging Obama when the two campaigned together in Florida on behalf of the federal stimulus. Now Rubio is trying to make a case that Crist, his rival in the Senate race, is to blame for the federal health care overhaul, too. "The path to ObamaCare becoming law all started with Charlie Crist supporting President Obama's $787 billion stimulus," Rubio's campaign said in a recent fundraising e-mail. "Marco is the only candidate you can trust to repeal Obamacare." We know that Charlie + Obama = manhug. And Obama + Congress = health care overhaul. But does Charlie + Obama + stimulus = Obamacare? To be honest, we started this analysis not sure how Rubio's statement could possibly be true. In fact, we wondered if the Rubio campaign aides would just scream 'Uncle" and accept a Pants On Fire. They didn't. "The night Obamacare passed, on the floor of the House, Nancy Pelosi said, in essence, that Obamacare would not be possible without the stimulus," Rubio adviser Alberto Martinez told PolitiFact Florida. "Charlie Crist was instrumental in providing the political support that Barack Obama needed to pass the stimulus." That's a big logical leap, so let's explore the facts behind it. On the fine point about Speaker Pelosi, Martinez is correct that she referenced the stimulus in her health care speech. "We would not be here tonight for sure without the extraordinary leadership and vision of President Barack Obama. We thank him for his unwavering commitment to health care for all Americans," Pelosi said on March 21, 2010. "This began over a year ago under his leadership in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act where we had very significant investments in science, technology, and innovation for health care reform. It continued in the president's budget a few months later, a budget which was a statement of our national values, which allocated resources that were part of our value system and in a way that stabilized our economy, created jobs, lowered taxes for the middle class and did so and reduced the deficit and did so in a way that had pillars of investment, including education and health care reform." The Rubio campaign tried to make hay of the speech the following day, linking Pelosi's words to Crist in a press release. The campaign also posted a video of Pelosi's statement with the headline "Pelosi: Road to ObamaCare began w/Crist-Obama Stimulus," and is now repeating the claim in the fundraising pitch. Charlie and the stimulus No doubt about it, Crist supported, campaigned for and endorsed the federal stimulus bill. But was he instrumental in it passing? Crist campaigned for the stimulus bill with Obama in Fort Myers on Feb. 10, 2009. He made several national television appearances supporting the proposal, saying on Hardball with Chris Matthews, for instance: "It's going to help (Floridians') children. It's going to help their traffic situation. It's going to help produce more jobs here in the Sunshine State. That's a perspective that I have to have as, in essence, the CEO of Florida. And that's why I support it." We also know that Crist lobbied members of Florida's congressional delegation from both parties to support the stimulus package. The Miami Herald reported that Crist lobbied Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and his brother, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, along with Democratic Reps. Kathy Castor and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. But what good did all of that campaigning from a prominent national Republican do? How many votes did he affect in Congress? Was he the lynchpin? Not a whole lot. Not a whole lot. And no. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 passed the U.S. House 244-188, without the support of one Republican (which means no Republicans from Florida). It then passed the U.S. Senate 61-37, with just three Republican votes: Maine's two Republican senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter. (Specter's now a Democrat, by the way.) If you're truly keeping score, the conference report -- the congressional action that merges the House and Senate bills -- passed the House 246-183, again without a single GOP vote, and passed the Senate 60-38 with the votes of Collins, Snowe and Specter. We also checked the Congressional Record to see if members of Congress referenced Crist during floor debate on the stimulus. Crist's name was mentioned once, on Feb. 11, 2009, by Democratic U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton of Ohio. Sutton was talking about Crist's support of the stimulus and how Crist said it could save and create jobs in Florida. So there's nothing to confirm the Rubio campaign's claim that Crist was "instrumental." There's no evidence that Crist's support swayed a single vote. For the Florida delegation -- like all state delegations except Maine and Pennsylvania -- it was strictly a party-line vote. Indeed, Crist was more outlier than influencer, a rare Republican leader who spoke up but was roundly criticized in his party. Brendan Daly, a Pelosi spokesman, said that because no House Republicans supported the bill, that he "does not think Crist was instrumental in passing it." We asked Kate Kelly, a spokesman for Specter, if Crist's support had been a key factor for the Pennsylvania senator. She replied, "Sen. Specter has never mentioned that as a reason he voted for the stimulus." Charlie begat stimulus; stimulus begat health care Now, to the Rubio campaign's claim that the stimulus bill led to health care reform. The stimulus act passed in February 2009 did have health care-related proposals, including a plan to create electronic health care records and about $20 billion to help unemployed workers purchase health care through the employer-based COBRA system. But the stimulus hardly was the impetus for health care reform. And if you read Pelosi's statement again, that's not what she was saying. She was praising Obama and citing some of his accomplishments and notable proposals that included health care. But there's scant evidence of a causal link between the stimulus and health care reform that the Rubio campaign alleges. First, health care reform pre-dates the 2009 economic stimulus by years -- or even decades. Obama made it one of his key domestic policy promises during the 2008 campaign. And the roots of reform can be traced as far back as President Theodore Roosevelt (Obama frequently mentions that the nation has been trying to overhaul health care since then). And of course, the issue came up during the early 1990s when Hillary Clinton chaired the health care task force in the Clinton administration. Second, Rubio has failed to prove a causal connection between the two. It's not like the stimulus bill created some kind of legal foundation for health care reform -- it was a bill filled with tax cuts and spending to boost the economy. And it's not like it provided Obama with a huge surge of momentum. Indeed, more than a year lapsed between the final passage of the stimulus and the health care bill. John Rother, executive vice president of policy and strategy for the AARP, a group that closely followed the health care debate, said there's no link between the stimulus and health care bill. Rubio "might be the only person in America who might make that claim," Rother said. Our ruling So Rubio contends that "The path to ObamaCare becoming law all started with Charlie Crist supporting President Obama’s $787 billion stimulus." The logic is that Crist was instrumental in helping Obama deliver the stimulus, and that the health care reforms would not be possible without the stimulus. We find this wrong on both points. Crist, while a vocal supporter of the stimulus and one of the only major Republicans endorsing the spending plan, did little to sway votes in Congress and get the stimulus bill passed into law. And the stimulus, while it had a few health care provisions, had little to do with the health care bill that eventually was passed by Congress. The seeds for the health care bill were sewn during Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, not at a town hall and hug in Fort Myers. All this to say, our first instinct was right. Pants on Fire!

pomt-10001	"The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/30/house-republicans/GOP-full-of-hot-air-about-Obamas-light-switch-tax/	Taxpayers may have been shocked to learn from House Republicans that President Barack Obama wants to pay for health care by charging them to turn on a light. "The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year," the House Republican Conference said in a Web post and press release titled "Questions on the Budget for President Obama," distributed March 24. "What effect will this have on Americans struggling to pay their mortgages?" it asked. This alleged "light switch tax" is a reference to Obama's proposal to tax power companies for carbon dioxide emissions, and allow companies to trade emissions credits among themselves. That's called a cap-and-trade program, and Republicans say the companies would just pass the tax on to electricity consumers. So any revenue raised by a cap-and-trade program amounts to a "light switch tax" on consumers, the House Republicans alleged. To back up the claim, their staff pointed us to an M.I.T. report that says a similar a cap-and-trade proposal (the administration has not yet detailed their own version) would raise $366 billion per year. If you divide that by the 117 million households in the United States, you find it would cost each household $3,128, they said. But is it that simple? Can you just assume consumers would be out $366 billion since that's how much the program would raise from fuel companies? No. "It's just wrong," said John Reilly, an energy, environmental and agricultural economist at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the report. "It's wrong in so many ways it's hard to begin." Not only is it wrong, but he told the House Republicans it was wrong when they asked him. "Someone from the House Republicans had called me (March 20) and asked about this," Reilly said. "I had explained why the estimate they had was probably incorrect and what they should do to correct it, but I think this wrong number was already floating around by that time." It continues to float. That's just not how economists calculate the cost of a tax proposal, Reilly said. The tax might push the price of carbon-based fuels up a bit, but other results of a cap-and-trade program, such as increased conservation and more competition from other fuel sources, would put downward pressure on prices. Moreover, consumers would get some of the tax back from the government in some form. The report did include an estimate of the net cost to individuals, called the "welfare" cost. It would be $30.89 per person in 2015, or $79 per family if you use the same average household size the Republicans used of 2.56 people. The cost would grow over time as the program ramps up, but the average annual cost over time in today's dollars — that is, the "average annual net present value cost" — is still just $85 per person, Reilly said. That would be $215.05 per household. A far cry from $3,128. And that isn't the only inaccuracy in the claim. The Republican press release said the cap-and-trade program would pay for "nationalized health care." But Obama's health care proposal is not for "nationalized health care." It does call for a "National Health Insurance Exchange" with private insurance options plus a new public plan based on the one currently available to members of Congress — but consumers could still keep their private insurance if they want, as Obama emphasized during his presidential campaign. Even if it were true that Obama wants to nationalize health care, he does not envision paying for health care reform with the cap-and-trade program as the Republicans alleged. Rather, his $634 billion health care reserve fund is to come from efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and decreased deductions for some charitable contributions by upper-income taxpayers, according to Obama's proposed budget. The House Republicans partially corrected this portion of the claim, changing their Web site and sending out an updated press release that says the cap-and-trade program would pay for "increased spending" rather than health care. But it still calls cap-and-trade a "light switch tax" and claims the whole cost would come from consumers. If the Republicans had simply misstated the results of the MIT study, the Truth-O-Meter would have been content giving this one a False. But for them to keep repeating the claim after the author of the study told them it was wrong means we have to set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire. Update, May 6, 2009 Two days after we published this item, Reilly sent a letter to Rep. John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House, complaining that his study "has been misrepresented in recent press releases distributed by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The press release claims our report estimates an average cost per family of a carbon cap and trade program that would meet targets now being discussed in Congress to be over $3,000, but that is nearly 10 times the correct estimate, which is approximately $340." (The $340 is a cost per family of four, comparable to the $215 we used as the cost per household of 2.56 people.) Reilly said it was "simplistic and misleading" to interpret the statistics the way the Republicans did because the administration's cap and trade proposal has "been designed to offset the energy cost impacts on middle and lower income households." A day later Boehner responded with a statement that insisted $3,128 was accurate. "In reality, it would be a tax of up to $3,100 per family on every American family that drives a car, buys products manufactured in the United States, or flips on a light switch," Boehner said in the statement. On April 22, the conservative Weekly Standard came to the defense of the Republicans and published an article that said Reilly had erred in calculating the cost. It said that Reilly had since corrected the figure from the original $340 to $800. The article by John McCormack, an editorial assistant at the publication, said that even with the corrected figure, Reilly was "still low-balling the cost of cap and trade by using some fuzzy logic. In reality, cap and trade could cost the average household more than $3,900 per year." The Weekly Standard noted that Obama plans to use some of the cap-and-trade revenues to fund his "making work pay" tax credit of $400 per individual and $800 per family per year but then did not reflect that plan in the ultimate cost to households. It said there was no proof that Reilly is correct to assume that "the $3,128 will be 'returned' to each household." The article also said that our PolitiFact item was incorrect because we relied on Reilly's numbers. Several PolitiFact readers who apparently believe that Reilly's corrected figure means the Republicans are now accurate, wrote to us and urged us to publish a correction. So we have revisited the numbers to provide this update. First, we should emphasize that our original item was simple and straightforward. The Republicans said their claim was based on the MIT study. But Reilly, the author of that study, said the Republicans were misrepresenting his work. And not only that, he said he'd told them they were misrepresenting his work before they made the claim, and they made the claim anyway. That struck us as an egregious falsehood. And it's important to recognize that our Pants on Fire rating was on the overall statement that, "The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year." The first part of that statement about nationalized health care is completely false. The Obama administration is not proposing nationalized health care, a phrase we believe is meant to invoke fears of socialized medicine. Yet Republicans have repeatedly made that inaccurate claim. So that part of the claim was and remains ridiculously false. Now, in light of Reilly's revised number and Boehner's refusal to change what he says, let's reconsider the second part of the claim, that the Obama administration is proposing "a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year." First, calling it a light switch tax remains incorrect. That implies that it is a federal tax levied on consumers when in fact it is an extrapolation of the per-family burden of a new federal charge that would be levied on energy companies. To say it "would cost every American household $3,128 a year" suggests tremendous precision. But we have found virtually no precision about anything to do with the cap and trade proposals because they are still very much just in the talking stages. Indeed, the House Democratic version is known as the "discussion draft" and, although there are some broad concepts, key details about how the program would work, its ultimate cost and how Americans would be reimbursed for higher energy costs are still far from final. But, given Reilly's corrected number, is it now accurate to say it will cost every household $3,128 a year? No, it's not. As we said in our original item, Reilly's analysis has produced two different ways to measure the cost of a cap and trade system. One way is the total estimate of federal revenues from a cap and trade auction, which indeed works out to $3,128 per family in the United States. That's the amount of money the energy companies would have to pay the federal government, and presumably the companies would pass those costs to consumers through higher prices. The issue then becomes whether or not the Obama administration intends to offset that cost to families. Republicans take the position, which was echoed by the Weekly Standard, that the Obama administration has no such plans. Reilly says the administration does. Who's right? Of course, we can't really know what the administration intends to do, but the available record makes it pretty clear that the White House has made plans to return to families the money the cap and trade program might cost them in energy bills. Some of it -- $400 per year for individuals, $800 for families -- would go directly back to families through the "making work pay" tax credit totalling $65 billion per year, according to the Obama budget proposal . An additional $15 billion per year would benefit them indirectly through research and development on clean energy technologies. And the budget specifies that "all additional net proceeds will be used to further compensate the public." That backs up Reilly's claim that the $3,128 is effectively returned to people. The second way to look at the cost of cap and trade is through the impact the proposal would have on the overall economy -- the extent to which the new system would constrain the economy and slow its growth. That's the source of Reilly's $340 number, which he has corrected to $800. That number is still far short of the very precise $3,128 the Republicans have been using. And Republican leaders continue to toss around the $3,100 number, often with no caveats or qualifiers -- or mention of the $800. We called Reilly to get his reaction to the article in the Weekly Standard and the Republicans' latest claim . He said the Weekly Standard editorial assistant who wrote the story "just completely twisted the whole thing." He said his correction to the $800 figure didn't substantially improve the accuracy of what the Republicans are contending. Their claim "is a misrepresentation. They are basing (the $3,128) on our study and that is an incorrect use of our study. It's false." Here at PolitiFact, we're sure there will be plenty of other claims in the next few months that will allow us to further examine the cost of a cap and trade proposal. This claim has centered on Reilly's two-year-old study, but other studies have been done more recently and will soon be in the political mix. But for now, this claim remains a serious distortion in many ways. It is a ridiculous falsehood to say the money is being used "for nationalized health care." It is inaccurate to call it a "light switch tax." And it is incorrect to cite a precise "tax" of $3,128 -- with no caveats or qualifiers -- when the Obama administration has specified how the money would be returned to people. Given Reilly's comments that they are using his numbers improperly, we see nothing to change our conclusion. So our original ruling stands: Pants on Fire. - Bill Adair, PolitiFact Editor	None	House Republican Conference	None	None	None	2009-03-30T11:24:41	2009-03-24	['United_States']
pomt-13462	Says Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin has "ties to the Muslim Brotherhood."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/14/sean-duffy/top-hillary-clinton-aide-has-ties-muslim-brotherho/	Interviewed on CNN as a Donald Trump surrogate, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy attacked Hillary Clinton for several minutes for having coughing fits and then took aim at one of her longtime aides, Huma Abedin. After the Aug. 23, 2016 exchange turned testy, the Wisconsin Republican told host Brianna Keilar she was the one who raised the coughing issue. Then this back-and-forth about Abedin ensued: Duffy: Why aren’t we talking then about Huma and her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood? Why aren’t we talking about the fact that she was an editor for a pro-Sharia newspaper? Keilar: She doesn’t have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Duffy: The information is out there that she does have these ties. Keilar: Uh, no. The Washington Post Fact Checker has already knocked down Duffy’s allegation. And, when we asked for backup, Duffy’s office cited to us only a New York Post column that didn’t directly allege any ties between Abedin and the Muslim Brotherhood. What is Muslim Brotherhood? The Muslim Brotherhood for years has been cast in a negative light by some Republican politicians. In 2012, then-U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., sent a letter to the deputy inspector general of the State Department. At the time, Clinton was secretary of state and Abedin was her deputy chief of staff. Bachmann (now a Trump campaign adviser) asked for an investigation, citing information that claimed Abedin’s mother, brother and late father were "connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations." In March 2016, when Trump and then-presidential candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich appeared in Milwaukee for a CNN Republican Town Hall event, Cruz called the Muslim Brotherhood a "terrorist organization." But a CNN news report debunked the Texas senator’s claim. The report pointed out that the Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamist organization with active branches in many Middle Eastern countries that was founded on the belief that Islam is not simply a religion, but a way of life and advocates for a move away from secularism -- and that it has never appeared on the U.S. State Department’s list of terrorist organizations, although Egypt and several other countries have put the group on their lists. Earlier that month, Cruz and other Republicans had tried to have the Muslim Brotherhood designated as a terrorist group. At the time, U.S. News & World Report described the group as an Egyptian Islamist organization dedicated to instilling Islamic law (Sharia) based on the teachings of the Quran and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. Experts said the group has not been involved in terrorism, rather it has functioned as a social organization and a political organization that participates in elections -- a description similar to one provided in a 2015 article in the Middle East Journal, an academic publication. Recent Abedin references Duffy’s staff cited a Paul Sperry column published two days before Duffy’s CNN interview. The column said that from 1996 to 2008, Abedin was an editor at the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs working under her mother, Saleha Abedin, who remains editor-in-chief. The column called the journal "a radical Muslim publication that opposed women’s rights and blamed the US for 9/11." But the column made no mention of the Muslim Brotherhood. An opinion piece by Trump supporter Kenneth Timmerman in The Hill, which piggybacked on the Sperry column, did mention the brotherhood -- but in a roundabout way, in relation to Abedin. The piece said Abedin’s father, Syed Zaynul Abedin, founded the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs; that the institute was supported by the Muslim World League; and that the league has been called "perhaps the most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world." The piece also said Abedin’s mother, Saleha Abedin, sits on the Presidency Staff Council of the International Islamic Council for Da’wa and Relief, a group that is chaired by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi. A fact check The Washington Post Fact Checker, after interviewing a number of experts, called the connections "so tenuous as to be obscure," and concluded: Duffy asked why the alleged Muslim Brotherhood connections to Huma Abedin are not being talked about. Perhaps it’s because they are bogus. Abedin has lived in the United States for 23 years, working in the White House, the Senate and the State Department. Vague suggestions of suspicious-sounding connections to her parents don’t pass the laugh test, even at the flimsiest standard of guilt by association. The Fact Checker gave Duffy four pinocchios -- its lowest rating. And we’ve found no evidence to support Duffy’s claim, either. Our rating Duffy says Clinton aide Huma Abedin has "ties to the Muslim Brotherhood." Duffy made the claim in the context of stories in the presidential campaign that get relatively little media coverage. But he cited no evidence to back his statement, and we couldn’t find any. We rate his statement False.	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2016-09-14T05:00:00	2016-08-23	['None']
pomt-06860	The debt ceiling deal will result in "the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/02/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-debt-ceiling-deal-lowers-domesti/	During his July 31, 2011, remarks announcing an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama offered a bit of historical context. "The first part of this agreement will cut about $1 trillion in spending over the next 10 years -- cuts that both parties had agreed to early on in this process," Obama said. "The result would be the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president -- but at a level that still allows us to make job-creating investments in things like education and research. We also made sure that these cuts wouldn’t happen so abruptly that they’d be a drag on a fragile economy." We received a number of requests to check Obama’s claim that the debt ceiling deal will result in "the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president." So we are checking it. First, we’ll need to explain the term "domestic spending," because in the past, Obama has used a slightly different term. In February, we rated a similar comment by Obama. Back then, he said that under his own budget proposal -- which was not enacted -- "domestic discretionary spending (would be at) its lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president." Domestic discretionary spending is generally defined as spending that (a) is not defense- or security-related, (b) is appropriated by Congress rather than being set by a formula (which is how funding for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is determined) and (c) is not used to pay interest on the debt. Domestic discretionary spending includes a broad range of spending categories, from air traffic control to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When we looked at Obama’s February comment, we found that according to White House budget projections, domestic discretionary spending under Obama’s proposal would indeed fall by 2015 to its lowest level since the early 1960s. That would come in the middle of Obama’s second term, if he wins one. We concluded that there was some merit to criticism that longer term "projections" about future reductions to discretionary spending were less meaningful than the ones proposed for the subsequent year. On that basis, and a few others, we rated Obama's claim Half True. The phrasing in the more recent statement is different. On July 31, Obama referred to "the lowest level of annual domestic spending." Taking Obama literally, he would be referring not just to domestic discretionary spending, as before, but domestic mandatory spending as well, including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. We didn't think that’s what he meant to say -- and the White House confirmed that it was not -- but at PolitiFact, words matter, so we’ll calculate the numbers both ways to be sure. Using the more traditional definition -- that is, non-defense discretionary spending, excluding domestic mandatory spending -- Obama is on pretty solid ground. The Office of Management and Budget has a historical table showing non-defense discretionary spending as a percentage of gross domestic product, going back to 1962. (Two brief and fairly minor caveats: 1961 was Eisenhower’s last budget, so the available data only goes back to the start of John F. Kennedy’s presidency, and a small portion of "domestic" discretionary spending is actually diplomatic in nature and thus international rather than domestic. But it’s a pretty small portion of the entire budget, so we’ll ignore it in our calculations.) The OMB table shows that since 1962, non-defense discretionary spending has ranged from between about 3.2 percent of GDP and 5.2 percent of GDP. So the question is whether the debt ceiling deal just struck will lower domestic discretionary spending below 3.2 percent of GDP. It does, according to calculations we made using Congressional Budget Office figures. To do this, we used three sets of statistics: the caps on discretionary spending set in the budget deal (table 1 here), the projected gross domestic product for each year from now until 2021 (table D-2 here) and the ratio between defense discretionary spending and non-defense discretionary spending (calculated from table 3-1 here). Because CBO only provided figures for discretionary spending as a whole, we first determined that defense spending is expected to account for about 54 percent of all discretionary spending through 2021, and non-defense spending is expected to account for 46 percent. So we divided the capped amount of discretionary spending set in the debt deal by the projected GDP for the appropriate year, then multiplied the result by 46 percent to determine how much non-defense discretionary spending represented as a percentage of GDP. We found that non-defense discretionary spending started as 3.6 percent of GDP in 2012, then would fall to 3.1 percent by 2014 and 2.5 percent by 2021. (This assumes GDP grows as projected, but these are the best numbers we have.) So, starting in 2014, non-defense discretionary spending is poised to fall below the lowest level it reached between 1962 and the present, and that percentage continues to decline through 2021. Using this measurement, then, Obama is correct. However, it’s important to note a few caveats. First, as we noted, Obama referred to "the lowest level of annual domestic spending." Using a strict definition of these words, the numbers would have to include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- and by this standard, Obama would be wrong. Those programs currently account for roughly 13 percent to 14 percent of GDP -- several times the share allocated to non-defense discretionary spending. The combination of these two percentages will be bigger -- even under the deal -- than in many of the years since 1962. Second, Obama implied that the debt deal deserves credit for achieving "the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president." In fact, the federal budget was already on a course to do this before the debt ceiling deal was struck. Earlier this year, CBO published projections (table 3-1 here) showing that non-defense discretionary spending would fall to 3.2 percent by 2019 and 3.1 percent in 2020 and 2021. The deal did have two important effects, however. It sped up the process -- setting a new post-1962 low by 2014 rather than by 2019 -- and it put the projections into law. So where does this leave us? Obama would have been right if he’d said the debt deal would reduce non-defense discretionary spending to its lowest level since 1962. If current projections of GDP are accurate, it would do so by 2014. And the deal deserves some credit for both accelerating the timetable for that achievement and enshrining it in law for the first time. But that’s not what Obama said. He said that the deal would bring "the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower." By not specifying that he was referring to "discretionary" spending, Obama is wrong, since the expenses for mandatory domestic programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will remain high in the years ahead. According to the White House, that's not what he meant, but he still said what he said. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-10804	"McCain Trying to Have it Both Ways on Iraq"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/03/democratic-national-committee/or-maybe-iraq-isnt-that-simple/	Sen. John McCain's television ad in which he touts his history of criticizing the Bush administration on Iraq has drawn the fire of the Democratic National Committee. In a news release on Oct. 3, 2007, the DNC declared, "McCain Trying to Have it Both Ways on Iraq." Here's the DNC's full charge: "After years of supporting President Bush's failed strategy in Iraq, and after leading the charge for the Bush-McCain escalation of that war, John McCain is trying to have it both ways by trying to cast himself as a longtime critic of the administration while at the same time refusing to change course on the war." Well, yes, that's true. McCain is indeed trying to cast himself as a longtime critic of the administration while staying the course in Iraq. More to the point, though, it's accurate. McCain actually has been a longtime critic of the administration on Iraq, even as he has advocated a sustained and larger military presence there. But saying that's "having it both ways" is just the kind of oversimplifying of facts the Democrats love to accuse the White House of doing. A bit like saying that opposing U.S. involvement Iraq is the same as opposing the war on terrorism. McCain's ad is part of an attempt to distinguish himself from the president on Iraq. The Democrats point out that McCain has been wedded to the president's overall war policy, and like President Bush, McCain has displayed a tendency to offer rosy predictions about the outcome in Iraq, even as conditions didn't seem to be improving much. All of that is true, and there's no shortage of evidence. "I think the situation on the ground is going to improve," McCain told the Hill newspaper on Dec. 8, 2005. "I do think that progress is being made in a lot of Iraq. Overall, I think a year from now, we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course. If I thought we weren't making progress, I'd be despondent." As the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain has been a tireless supporter of the war, and he has robustly defended the president's ability to wage the war as he saw fit. Arguing Sept. 19, 2007, against an amendment that would have required troops to spend as much time at home as they spent in Iraq before being sent back to Iraq, McCain said this on the Senate floor: "Clearly the message I am getting from the troops in the field is not that the war is lost. ... We are succeeding and we are winning. And with the enactment of this amendment, we will choose to lose. This is setting a formula for surrender, not for victory. "I am hearing from the troops in the field three words, three words: Let us win. They have sacrificed a great deal. ... Now give them a chance to win. That is what they want. They do not want that sacrifice to be in vain." McCain was calling for more troops and resources as far back as 2003, just months after the invasion. He criticized former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for two years before Rumsfeld resigned. In speeches and interviews, he frequently warned that failure to change tactics would lead to a long and difficult fight. In fact, it's common for McCain to express his concerns about the U.S. strategy in Iraq and his belief in the U.S. mission there in the same speech. "We have made many, many mistakes since 2003 and these will not be easily reversed," McCain said during a Jan. 5, 2007, panel discussion at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. "Even greater than the cost thus far, and in the future, however, are the catastrophic consequences that would ensue from our failure in Iraq." McCain's positions on Iraq underscore the complexity of the war as a political issue, and of McCain's unique position as supporter and critic. It may prove difficult for voters to get the nuance. It also may offer a little insight into why the other top-tier presidential candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike, are treading a bit more lightly. The DNC's critique of McCain has at its core a nugget of truth about how McCain supports the war while being critical of how it has been conducted. But we find the DNC's claim that this is "having it both ways" to be a Barely True presentation of the facts. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2007-10-03T00:00:00	2007-10-03	['Iraq']
pomt-10072	"Geithner still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Service flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/16/competitive-enterprise-institute/geithners-second-crack-squaring-taxes/	Honest mistake. That's the line from the Obama team about the tax problems that have sparked controversy about treasury secretary nominee Timothy Geithner. The IRS audited Geithner in 2006 and found that he failed to pay self-employment taxes on compensation he received as an employee of the International Monetary Fund for tax years the IRS was looking at, 2003 and 2004. By law, the IRS could not audit him for years prior to 2003. So Geithner paid $16,732 in back self-employment tax and interest. The IRS waived penalties for those years. As far as the IRS was concerned, case closed. Fast forward to late 2008. The Obama transition team began to vet Geithner in preparation for Obama nominating him to his Cabinet. The transition team found a few problems in Geithner's previous tax returns, including the fact that in addition to not paying self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, he also didn't pay them for 2001 and 2002. So last month, Geithner voluntarily amended his tax returns for those years and wrote a check to the IRS for another $25,970. His nomination followed immediately after. Some opponents of Geithner's nomination find this second payment particularly troubling. "Treasury Secretary Nominee Timothy Geithner's failure to pay four years’ worth of self-employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare is absolutely astonishing," John Berlau, director of the Center for Investors & Entrepreneurs at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said in a news release on Jan. 14, 2009. "And as more details are released, Geithner's actions seem even more disturbing. According to the New York Times, Geithner still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years. To have him leading the department that manages the IRS would be a slap in the face to the millions of self-employed Americans who fulfill their responsibilities to correctly asses their tax burdens." Berlau's organization is a conservative think tank "dedicated to the principles of free enterprise and limited government." His criticism is typical of those who are opposing Geithner's nomination. By some accounts, it can be confusing for IMF employees to figure out their tax obligation. As an international organization, the IMF is exempt from the FICA and Social Security taxes that most Americans get deducted from their paychecks automatically. U.S. nationals who work for the IMF in the United States are required pay them on their own. But let's put aside for the moment the issue of whether Geithner should have known he was obligated to pay the self-employment taxes (Republicans have correctly noted that Geithner got ample documentation from the IMF informing him of his tax obligation). There's still the issue of the 2001 and 2002 taxes that Geithner didn’t pay until the presidential transition team pointed it out. First off, tax experts say that due to a statute of limitations, Geithner was under no legal obligation to pay the taxes related to 2001 and 2002. The IRS could only go back three years. So Geithner was legally in the clear. But considering that the IMF pays extra money to U.S. employees, on top of their regular salary, to offset those self-employment taxes, some have questioned whether Geithner had a moral or ethical obligation to square up with the government. After the IRS pointed out in 2006 that Geithner had not paid his self-employment taxes in 2003 and 2004, it stands to reason Geithner would then have known that he also didn’t pay in 2001 and 2002. "You have to ask yourself, 'Would you do it?'" asked Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center. That's an issue the Senate Finance Committee overseeing Geithner's confirmation hearing will have to weigh. But as for Berlau's statement that Geithner "still didn't correct the same type of error for some years, even after the Internal Revenue Services flagged him for the failure to pay the taxes in other years," Berlau is right. Geithner didn’t make good on the previous years until he learned he was in line to be treasury secretary. We rule the statement True.

pomt-12450	"We got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years" under Barack Obama.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-pants-fire-claim-air-force-pilots-force/	Lauding Republican legislation that would increase defense spending, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan attacked former President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress, charging they had put the military in a "readiness crisis." And he made a claim -- about the Air Force and museums, of all things -- that we want to check. "Under President Obama, Democrats insisted that an increase in defense spending be tied to an equal increase in non-defense spending," the Wisconsin Republican said at a news conference on May 2, 2017. "You want to help the troops? You want to help the military? I need just as much money for domestic discretionary spending. "That was the Obama rule that we lived under for eight years. They insisted on this even as our military plunged further and further into a readiness crisis. Well, we got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years." So, this is a sweeping claim: Air Force pilots, crippled by inadequate funding, being forced to scavenge for parts in museums to keep their own planes flying. Typically we don’t use many quotes in our fact checks. But in this case, they seem to tell the story about Ryan’s claim: "That’s a grotesque distortion," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group Corp., which does research on the aerospace and defense industry. "It’s grossly misleading," said Benjamin Friedman, a Cato Institute defense and homeland security studies research fellow. "While I admire Ryan, and agree that there are some problems in military readiness, this kind of hyperbole needs to be called out," said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. Ryan’s evidence Ryan’s staff noted to us that PolitiFact Texas in July 2016 checked a similar but much more involved claim made by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. Our colleagues found that Air Force maintenance workers pull parts from warehoused planes at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz. -- a practice that goes back decades because it saves money and keeps the Air Force from waiting longer for new parts to be made. But that fact check didn’t get to whether the Air Force takes what seems like a more desperate step of sending parts hunters to museums. The only example Ryan’s office cited was a May 2016 Fox News article in which an Air Force captain said spare parts needed for a B-1 bomber at a base in South Dakota were taken from seven "museum aircraft" from around the country, including the South Dakota Air and Space Museum. So, Ryan’s evidence is pretty thin: An isolated example to back a broad claim. Expert views Conversely, more than a half dozen experts confirmed to us that it has been common for decades to retrieve parts in military airplane "boneyards." Indeed, that is one of the main purposes for collecting and preserving older planes at such sites. Davis-Monthan, according to AirplaneBoneyards.com, is the largest aircraft boneyard in the world. Known officially as the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, the boneyard has more than 4,400 aircraft from the Air Force, other military branches and other federal agencies, according to the base. Besides storing aircraft that can be tapped for parts, the base also restores planes to put them back into operation. The boneyard also offers tours. But that hardly makes it a museum. As for Ryan’s slap at the Obama administration’s military spending, PolitiFact National found in December 2015 that the spending did drop during Obama’s tenure. But O’Hanlon, Todd Harrison at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Laicie Heeley at the Stimson Center and other defense experts agreed that lack of funds has not been a problem in terms of the Air Force finding spare parts. Our rating Saying the military was plunged into a readiness crisis under Obama, Ryan claimed: "We got to a point that our Air Force pilots were going to museums to find spare parts over the last eight years." It is a broad claim, but his office cited only one news article that quoted an Air Force captain as saying parts for seven planes were obtained from "museum aircraft." Meanwhile, defense experts told us that Ryan’s claim was highly misleading, in that any such museum scrounging, if it has ever occurred, is isolated. Indeed, the Air Force operates a base whose main functions include storing thousands of planes to be available for spare parts. The experts also agreed that even as defense spending dropped under Obama, the Air Force had sufficient funding to prevent the need for pilots to hunt for airplane parts in museums. We rate Ryan’s claim Pants on Fire. Editor's note: This item was updated on June 9, 2017 to say that the Fox News report did identify one museum. That information does not change the rating.

pomt-02998	Says "nearly 30,000" federal employees in Oregon were furloughed during the government shutdown.	false	/oregon/statements/2013/oct/17/suzanne-bonamici/were-30000-oregonians-employed-federal-government-/	The federal government is finally reopening its doors, and hundreds of thousands of furloughed employees are back on the job. Still, the cost to the economy lingers. Recently, Standard & Poor’s, the financial services company, estimated that the 16-day shutdown cost the U.S. economy some $24 billion. In an opinion piece published on OregonLive.com a few days before the government reopened, U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., bemoaned such costs. "The government shutdown is already causing damage," she wrote. "Veterans’ benefits have been held up, national parks and museums are closed, federal research has been halted, and small business loan applications are not being processed. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees, including nearly 30,000 in Oregon, have been furloughed, and millions more continue to do their jobs without knowing when they’ll receive a paycheck." The consequences of the political brinksmanship are no doubt profound. Still, the piece about 30,000 Oregonians being on furlough caught our attention. We’d read lots of articles that mentioned the state’s nearly 30,000 federal employees, but surely they weren't all on furlough, right? We started where we usually do, with the source, and called the representative’s office. Bonamici’s spokesman, Mike Morosi, looked into the matter and quickly issued a clarification. "The Oregonian and other news outlets have reported that there are approximately 30,000 federal employees in the state of Oregon," read the widely circulated clarification. "The precise number of federal employee furloughs fluctuated throughout the duration of the 16 day shutdown. Our office has requested an analysis of furloughs in Oregon, but it will take some time before that information is made available. "The guest editorial was careful to not claim that all federal employees in Oregon had been furloughed, but the use of the word ‘nearly’ may have been an overstatement. Some news reports indicate that roughly a third of federal employees nationwide have been furloughed, but that number differs greatly by agency and state. "In the absence of more specific information, it would have been more appropriate to say that ‘many of the approximately 30,000 federal employees in Oregon have been furloughed.’ " We asked Morosi how long it would take to get the furlough analysis the representative’s office has requested. Unfortunately, he said, it could take longer than a week given how backlogged much of the federal government is following the shutdown. The quick response and clarification from the office was definitely appreciated, but PolitiFact Oregon generally continues to pursue the question even if the speaker admits a mistake. Words matter and such statements can last a long time in the political arena, even if they are revised later. So we called Nick Beleiciks, a state employment economist with the Oregon Labor Market Information System. He told us that the most recent data put the state’s number of federal workers at 26,926. Of those, 6,567 work for the U.S. Postal Service and were not furloughed. That left a possible 20,000 employees. But even that number is an overstatement because 3,500 work for federally run hospitals such as the Veterans Affairs medical centers. And 3,000 work for federal environmental programs and nearly 1,500 in national security and international affairs positions, including the Transportation Security Administration. Now, some of those 8,000 employees may have been furloughed, but others were considered essential and continue to work and still others, like those working for Veterans Affairs, have positions funded a year in advance or through other sources. That is all to say that the number of Oregon workers on furlough was not "nearly 30,000." In fact, State Economist Mark McMullen told Oregonian reporter Molly Young that about "one-thid of those employees, or about 9,000 workers" would likely be furloughed when the shutdown first began. In our various discussions, Morosi did note that those working still had to forgo paychecks. They’ll receive back pay, but until the government opened again, checks couldn’t be written. That was no doubt a huge strain on many households -- it certainly would be for ours -- and it’s good context. Bonamici said nearly 30,000 federal employees in Oregon were furloughed because of the government shutdown. Now it’s true that those nearly 30,000 federal employees in Oregon were affected by the shutdown, but they weren’t all furloughed. We’d love to have the full forthcoming analysis requested by the representative’s office, but even without its specifics, we know this statement isn’t accurate. We rate this statement False.

pomt-06583	Stimulus money funded a government board that made recommendations that would cost 378,000 jobs and $28.3 billion in sales.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/27/paul-broun/broun-stimulus-money-funded-effort-will-kill-jobs/	Hey, Chester the Cheetah. You think it ain’t easy bein’ cheesy? Well, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens says that the federal government wants to hang your hide on its wall. And it could take down hundreds of thousands of jobs with you. Republican Broun tweeted his concern for the Cheetos snack food mascot during President Barack Obama’s Sept. 8 jobs speech before Congress. Food company critics are targeting Chester for extinction because they think using cartoon characters to sell junk food fuels childhood obesity. As you may remember, Broun has taken to sitting out joint sessions, such as January’s State of the Union Address, so he can tweet critiques of the president real-time. Chester came up in the second of a four-part list explaining why Broun thinks the country doesn’t need the new jobs bill. The president could simply change his policies, Broun argued. "2) Stimulus $ study on food advertising: proj -$28.3 billion in sales and -378,000 #jobs – just to keep Chester the Cheetah off the air," he tweeted. Feds are willing to kill off that much of the economy to restrict food marketing to children? And they’re doing this with stimulus money? Chester better trade those sunglasses for a bulletproof vest. And we’d better check Broun’s facts. In 2009, Congress created the Interagency Working Group on Food Marketed to Children to study and recommend standards for efforts with a large audience of 17 years old or younger. In April, the working group recommended voluntary guidelines that would reduce kids’ exposure to pitches for products that don’t meet certain nutritional guidelines. Targeting children through television, radio, print, company-sponsored websites, email and text messaging, product placement, toy branding, sports team sponsorships, and other methods would cease. Chester’s defenders pounced. A Broun spokesman referred us to an Aug. 29 paper published by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. It said that "even the working group concluded that the guidelines would result in a 20 percent reduction in ad expenditures that would in turn cause losses of $28.3 billion in manufacturing and retail sales and 378,000 jobs lost by 2015." But the working group did not come to this conclusion. Economic analysis firm IHS Global Insight wrote the report. We also noticed that the Heritage Foundation’s numbers are off, as are those in Broun’s tweet. The IHS report actually says that from 2011 through 2015, lost sales would total $152 billion. The predicted loss of $28.3 billion is for 2011 alone. Furthermore, stimulus dollars did not fund the group, as Broun asserted. Records show the board was created by a separate bill and was funded by the regular budgets of the agencies involved. Now, IHS Global Insight’s analysis does not fit the accepted definition of a "study," as Broun called it. It wasn’t peer-reviewed or conducted by an independent professional. It was funded by opponents of the guidelines. Most importantly, its methodology wasn’t transparent. Broun spokeswoman Meredith Griffanti and IHS spokesman Mike Raimondi defended the IHS report, saying the firm is well-regarded (it is the successor to a research organization founded by a 1980 winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics) and guideline opponents were not fishing for numbers to suit their claims. Food manufactures actually thought IHS’ report underestimated how much the guidelines would hurt the economy, Griffanti said. Raimondi said he could not provide detailed information on the findings because IHS did not write a more comprehensive report. He said the results were based on federal and industry data and decades of research. PolitiFact Georgia showed IHS’ report to three marketing professors. They all had reservations with the report’s fundamental assumption: that food and beverage advertising spending would drop 20 percent. IHS did not publish how it reached its conclusions, so other experts cannot check them. "Based on this type of reasoning without any support, I could just as easily assume that there would be smaller decreases. There’s no way of telling," said Jerome Williams, a Rutgers University marketing professor who has studied food marketing to children. In fact, marketing spending might not decline at all, experts said. Companies could redirect the cash to promote healthier kids foods or sell salty snacks to grown-ups. IHS did not look into this possibility, Raimondi said. Ad spending could even increase, Williams said. After the federal government banned cigarette advertising on radio and television in 1971, U.S. cigarette marketing spending grew. In 1970, it totaled $361 million, according to the Federal Trade Commission. In 1975, it was more than $491 million; in 1976, it was $639 million. Broun’s camp rejected the tobacco analogy because the proposed voluntary guidelines would block ads on shows with big adult audiences, as well as marketing techniques beyond broadcast such as product placement. That said, independent scholars haven’t corroborated the IHS report, noted University of Arizona professor Dale Kunkel, an expert on food marketing to children. And while the voluntary guidelines could lead to job losses, they could also create jobs for those who develop and market healthier foods, Emory University marketing professor Douglas Bowman said. Published reports show that food manufactures are innovating in response to child obesity concerns. For instance, Cheetos no longer advertises to children, but the brand is still growing, especially in the Latino market, an executive said last year during a PepsiCo investor event. He said it was rolling out Cheetos with less sodium and fat in Brazil. Griffanti said job creation is unlikely because food companies are continuously updating their products. In sum, while Broun does have a point that jobs could be affected by the guidelines, his claim is deeply flawed. Stimulus dollars did not fund the group that produced the voluntary guidelines. The report that predicted major economic losses was not a true study. Plus, there’s evidence to think that advertising spending won’t plummet. And since the guidelines are voluntary, companies could avoid implementing the bits they think would be too tough on their bottom lines. Or they could ignore them altogether. Chester, take heart. You still have a chance. We rate Broun’s claim False.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2011-09-27T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['None']
pomt-04667	Mitt Romney "said it was 'tragic' to end the war in Iraq."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-said-it-was-tragic-end-war-iraq/	President Barack Obama portrayed himself as seasoned on foreign policy and Mitt Romney as new to the world stage during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. "You know, in a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven. Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did," he said. "My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy, but from all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly." Obama then went through a long list of complaints about Romney’s foreign policy views, including this one: "My opponent said it was ‘tragic’ to end the war in Iraq." PolitiFact is evaluating other claims from Obama’s speech. Here, we wondered if Obama correctly quoted Romney as saying it was "tragic" to end the war in Iraq. Back in October 2011, Obama announced that all troops would leave by the end of the year. Obama had always intended to draw down forces in Iraq, but by the end of 2011, the administration couldn’t reach an agreement with the Iraqi government on the size of the residual force. In the final days leading up to withdrawal, the U.S. had about 200 members remaining that operate within the American Embassy, the New York Times wrote. Romney criticized the withdrawal as too hasty, making comments at a roundtable discussion with veterans on Veterans Day in 2011 at a South Carolina barbecue restaurant. A colonel asked Romney how he would handle the influx of soldiers returning home from Iraq in need of jobs, according to a transcript of the event. Romney called Obama’s troop removal "an enormous mistake," "a failing," and yes, "tragic." His complete response: "Yeah. A couple of things. One, you probably know that it is my view that the withdrawal of all of our troops from Iraq by the end of this year is an enormous mistake and a failing by the Obama administration. Secretary Panetta and others had indicated they were working to put in place a Status of Forces Agreement to maintain our presence there, so that we could most effectively transition to the Iraqi military and Iraqi security forces providing security for their country. "The precipitous withdrawal is unfortunate. It's more than unfortunate. I think it's tragic. It puts at risk many of the victories that were hard-won by the men and women who have served there. I hope the risk is not realized. I hope instead that the Iraqis are able to pick up the baton, and despite the fact that we will have walked away on a too-rapid basis." From there, Romney moved on to the issue of jobless veterans (and even praised an Obama initiative to give businesses who hire veterans a tax credit). By this point, Romney’s disdain for Obama’s Iraq war policy was known for a few weeks. His campaign issued a biting statement when Obama announced his plan to withdraw all troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. "President Obama’s astonishing failure to secure an orderly transition in Iraq has unnecessarily put at risk the victories that were won through the blood and sacrifice of thousands of American men and women," Romney wrote on Oct. 21, 2011. "The unavoidable question is whether this decision is the result of a naked political calculation or simply sheer ineptitude in negotiations with the Iraqi government." The Obama campaign countered that Romney lacked a plan to end the war. Romney’s current campaign website is vague on plans for Iraq. He buries the issue in a topics page about the Middle East, praising George W. Bush’s 2007 "surge" of troops and bashing Obama’s 2011 withdrawal deadline. He makes a reference to reports from field commanders who "recommended a 14,000 to 18,000-strong residual force as the minimum necessary to carry out our transition mission." "In light of these developments, it is impossible to forecast what conditions in Iraq will confront the next American president in January 2013," Romney states on his website. We contacted both campaigns for our report. The Obama campaign pointed us to Romney’s remarks at the veterans’ roundtable. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said Obama took Romney’s quote "completely out of context." Our ruling According to Obama, Romney "said it was ‘tragic’ to end the war in Iraq." Romney characterized Obama’s 2011 removal of troops from the country with that word, but he was talking about the pace of the drawdown. Romney’s point, held by other Republicans, was that Obama’s drawdown happened too quickly and would lead to an unstable transition for Iraq. Romney has said conditions in Iraq are difficult to forecast and he would prefer a larger transitional force. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01587	"Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/07/chuck-todd/chuck-todd-said-8-9-states-toss-senate-races-are-l/	Chuck Todd kicked off his hosting duties on Meet the Press by landing an interview with President Barack Obama. But because he’s widely known as a politics junkie, the show also spent a lot of time discussing the 2014 Senate races. Over the weekend, the White House announced Obama wouldn’t be taking executive action on immigration reform before the midterms. Obama told Todd it wasn’t about the upcoming elections, but the Meet the Press pundits disagreed. "Democrats are playing defense this year in the race for the Senate. They’re playing in red states where this issue is always going to red hot," said Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report, one of the show’s panelists. "Taking executive action on anything Republicans could call amnesty would boost the Republican base." Conversely, if you look at demographics, action on immigration may not play a significant role for boosting Democratic turnout in the Senate races, Todd pointed out. "Look at this map, you have this great stat," Todd said. "Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate." We thought Todd’s statement was interesting, so we decided to take a deep dive into the numbers. Competitive seats Out of the Senate seats up for election this year, the Cook Political Report rates nine races as toss-ups, meaning either party has a chance of winning. The Cook Report also counts three more races as competitive but leaning toward one party. There is some deviation on the number of competitive races. On the high end, CNN considers 12 races competitive, dividing them into six seats "up for grabs" and six with "tilts" towards a party. On the low end, FiveThirtyEight, which doesn’t label the races competitive or otherwise, lists five seats in which leaders have less than a 60 percent chance of winning. Cook Political Report FiveThirtyEight CNN Alaska Toss-up Toss-up Toss-up Arkansas Toss-up Leaning Republican Toss-up Colorado Toss-up Toss-up Leaning Democrat Georgia Toss-up Leaning Republican Leaning Republican Iowa Toss-up Toss-up Toss-up Kansas Leaning Republican Toss-up Safe Republican Kentucky Toss-up Leaning Republican Toss-up Louisiana Toss-up Leaning Republican Toss-up Michigan Toss-up Leaning Democrat Leaning Democrat New Hampshire Leaning Democrat Leaning Democrat Leaning Democrat North Carolina Toss-up Toss-up Toss-up West Virginia Leaning Republican Safe Republican Leaning Republican Nonetheless, while projections of tilts and toss-ups differ, nine seems to be a popular number of competitive states, the same number reported by the New York Times, Huffington Post, and the Rothenberg Political Report. Hispanic voters Todd’s chart on Hispanic voter numbers listed the source as a New York Times article, which extrapolated figures from past Census Bureau surveys to project 2014 elections. For good measure, we’ll compare the Times’ estimates for the nine states to 2012 Census results for 12 states considered to be competitive. Actual Hispanic voter turnout in 2012 and the projected number of likely Hispanic voters in 2014 are both lower than the share of eligible voters. By both sources, Todd is right to say that Hispanic voters comprise less than 10 percent of the total voters in states that are toss-ups. Whether that’s out of the top five, top nine, or top 12 most competitive states, only one, Colorado, has a Hispanic voting population above 10 percent. Mindy Romero, director of the University of California-Davis Civic Engagement Project, agrees with the Times’ conclusion that the Hispanic voting population will only have a little impact in the competitive 2014 Senate races. But that’s not without caveats. "Latinos will still impact congressional races, though they may not change the outcomes in these races," Romero said. In the short term, Latino voters may not alter the toss-up races significantly, but Romero said they’ll definitely matter in the long run. Take a look at California, a once red and then purple state that’s now solidly blue, in part thanks to Latino voters. "(California senators) Boxer and Feinstein are very safe, and Latinos are a large part of the story of why those two seats are safe, Romero said. The ruling Todd said, "Eight out of the nine states with competitive Senate races, Hispanics make up less than 10 percent of the electorate." Though there’s some deviation in the number of competitive states, nine seems like a pretty safe bet, and the number reported by a good portion of news sources. As for the share of Hispanic voting population, Todd is right on the money. We rate his claim True.	None	Chuck Todd	None	None	None	2014-09-07T18:13:41	2014-09-07	['None']
pomt-04320	Says that "when Congressman (Steve) Cohen took office in 2007, the unemployment rate was at 4.8 percent. The unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7 percent."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/28/george-flinn/george-flinn-blames-steve-cohen-shleby-unemploymen/	With what sometimes appears to be an unlimited supply of money to spend on campaign commercials, Dr. George Flinn is flooding the airwaves trying to make voters in the 9th Congressional District reconsider returning the incumbent, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, to Washington, D.C. In a campaign mailershowing the crumbling edifice of a large brick building, Flinn, the state’s biggest campaign self-funder, provides voters with numbers that indicate the unemployment rate in Shelby County is more than twice as bad now as it was when Cohen began in Congress. The 9th is comprised mostly of Memphis, with some parts of northern Shelby County, and recent national media reports have pointed out that Cohen is one of the few southern white Democrats remaining in Congress. "When Congressman Cohen took office in 2007, the unemployment rate was at 4.8 percent," reads one bullet point. And then the very next one says, "The unemployment rate in Shelby County has reached 9.7 percent." The Cohen campaign has challenged the veracity of many claims by Flinn, a radiologist who has built his wealth by owning radio stations and spent millions on various campaigns since 2002. Cohen’s campaign says the mailer contains numbers that are both out of context and inaccurate. So we asked the Flinn campaign for evidence. On statements like this, where statistics are used in an attempt to assign someone credit or blame, it is PolitiFact policy to a) determine the accuracy of the numbers and b) the extent to which the designation of credit or blame is accurate. Flinn spokeswoman Kristi Stanley defended the mailer and said the numbers came straight from federal statistics as reported by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. But when we double-checked, we found that the Cohen campaign was closer to the truth -- Flinn’s campaign either misread the statistics or cherry-picked other numbers from the years 2007 (when Cohen took office) and 2012 (the current election year). Cohen officially took office as the 9th Congressional District representative in January of 2007, following his election in November of 2006 to succeed five-term Congressman Harold Ford Jr. The originally reported unemployment rate for Shelby County for January of 2007 was 5.5 percent. When it was later revised, the new numberwas 5.7 percent. Either way, a significant distance from the 4.8 percent listed on the mailer. What about the unemployment rate now? The 9.7 percent figure used by the Flinn campaign appears to be pegged to reports for July, but the unemployment rate by August dropped to 9.0 percent in Shelby County. Those numbers for August did not become available until Sept. 27, so it’s possible the mailer was prepared with only the July numbers available. In any case, the most recent figures reported on Oct. 25 show the unemployment rate for Shelby County had dropped to 8.4 percent, following national trends. As to whether Cohen deserves blame for the unemployment rate’s worsening in Shelby County since arriving in D.C. in January of 2007, we reached out to some economists and consulted similar PolitiFact rulings involving other elected officials. Malcolm Getz, an associate professor of economics at Vanderbilt University, put it this way in an email: "One member of Congress has 1/435 of the vote in the House of Representatives. Whatever passes the House must also pass the Senate. The system is designed to allow many voices to be heard and counted with no single voice having determinative effect." And: "Macroeconomic phenomena like the unemployment rate is strongly influenced by events outside of government control." Economics professor John Gnuschke, head of the University of Memphis’s Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research, had a similar reaction: "A single Congressman doesn't have the ability to change the direction of the economy or the recovery." Gnuschke wrote further that "economic conditions in Memphis mirrored those in the rest of the nation and were in no way unique. . . . Improvements locally have been slow because the nation's recovery from the Great Recession has been slow. Congressman Cohen was not the cause of the decline and is not the problem with the slow recovery. Look to a weak private sector and their unwillingness to hire and invest as the issue of the day." Google makes it possible to create charts that show the unemployment rate over time, and you can compare different geographies. When you match up the unemployment rates for the United States, Tennessee, Shelby County and Memphis, you get four lines that rise and fall consistently at about the same rate. The Cohen campaign strongly believes Cohen does not deserve blame for the numbers, and points to examples that it says represent actions that improved the economic situation in Memphis and Shelby County. Cohen campaign manager John Marek wrote in an email: "Congressman Cohen brought us Tennessee’s first Minority Business Center, which will give racial minorities and women more access to business loans, which means jobs. Congressman Cohen also saved 500 jobs when he ensured that the American Steamship Company came to Memphis, and he created many jobs in Memphis when he brought us the $15 million Tiger grant, which will be a big development project downtown. He supported President Obama's jobs bill, which was blocked by Republicans in Congress." Marek also made this point -- Flinn was a Shelby County Commissioner from 2004 to 2010: "Arguably a County Mayor and County legislature would have more to do with the unemployment numbers than a Federal Congressman." Flinn’s campaign stands by the mailer and says Cohen has not delivered. Our ruling In a campaign mailer, Republican congressional candidate George Flinn blamed Steve Cohen for the unemployment rate in Shelby County being more than twice as bad now (4.8 percent to 9.7 percent) than it was in 2007 when he took office. But Flinn’s numbers are off, no matter if you stop the clock at the July numbers or the more recent September numbers. Further, the campaign overreaches by trying to pin responsibility for Shelby County’s economic collapse and then gradual recovery on one elected official. We rule this claim False.

pomt-08834	"The border security plan of Sens. McCain and Kyl called for 3,000 additional troops to keep us safe. President Obama says he'll send 524."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/11/john-mccain/john-mccain-said-he-would-add-3000-troops-border-w/	Sen. John McCain of Arizona is up for re-election and facing a challenge in the Republican primary from J.D. Hayworth. His latest television ad ignores his primary opponent, instead going after President Barack Obama and emphasizing that McCain is committed to border security. "The border security plan of Sens. McCain and Kyl called for 3,000 additional troops to keep us safe. President Obama says he'll send 524," the narrator says. "This is no political game, Mr. President. It's about Arizona lives. It's a fight we must win. And with John McCain on our side, we will." We wanted to check whether it was true that McCain called for 3,000 troops while Obama said he would send 524. First, we checked out the plan outlined by McCain Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz.. The 10-point proposal was released in April and includes the following point: "Immediately deploy 3,000 National Guard Troops along the Arizona/Mexico border, along with appropriate surveillance platforms, which shall remain in place until the Governor of Arizona certifies, after consulting with state, local and tribal law enforcement, that the Federal Government has achieved operational control of the border. Permanently add 3,000 Custom and Border Protection Agents to the Arizona/Mexico border by 2015." McCain and Kyl introduced a bill to carry out the plan in May, but there has been no significant action on the proposed legislation. But McCain did add an amendment to a pending appropriations bill that authorizes defense spending; the amendment would send 6,000 troops to the border area, double the number McCain mentioned in his ad. The bill has not yet come up for a vote in the full Senate. Now, for Obama's plan. Obama announced in May that he was sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the southwest border to help with border security. The troops were sent to different states: 524 to Arizona, 250 to Texas, 224 to California, and 72 to New Mexico. Other troops were to serve in command and control or support positions in various states, according to the U.S. Army. But Obama has also asked Congress to pass emergency legislation to add 1,000 new border patrol agents. That legislation is pending, and the number has been increased to 1,500 agents. It does not specify how many agents would be assigned to which states. McCain said he supports the bill and that it should be passed as quickly as possible. So McCain supports 3,000 to 6,000 additional troops. On Obama's side, you could count the 1,200 National Guard troops he sent in May, plus 1,500 agents to be funded by legislation Obama is expected to sign upon passage. That totals 2,700, or 2,200, if you only count Obama's original request to Congress. In his ad, McCain gives a fair description of his own proposal calling for 3,000 more troops. But he downplays the number of personnel Obama has called for. The number 524 represents only National Guard troops being sent to Arizona as part an initiative announced in May. It does not include the 1,000 to 1,500 additional border patrol agents in proposed legislation that Obama supports, some of whom would be assigned to Arizona. Still, McCain does appear to want more new agents and troops sent to the border than Obama does. So we rate McCain's statement Half True.

pomt-03611	"Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/09/chris-christie/new-chris-christie-tv-ad-touts-balanced-budgets-jo/	No new taxes. The best job growth in a decade. All under Chris Christie’s leadership. New Jersey was a broken state before Christie became governor, but now that he’s here and has made tough decisions, the state is on a more positive and fiscally sound path, a new television ad claims. "Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever," a narrator states as scenes of a gritty New Jersey and the aftermath of October’s Hurricane Sandy, play. This fact-check looks strictly at the ad’s claims about balanced budgets, new taxes and job growth. Two of the claims are on target. We will fact-check the ad’s education-related claims Sunday. The governor claims he balanced four budgets and he’s correct. But it’s hardly an accomplishment that distinguishes Christie from any other governor since state law requires a balanced spending plan. No new taxes for anyone, however, is debatable. During a 2011 town hall meeting in Evesham Township, Christie ruled out any tax increases, according to a fact sheet for the ad shared by Christie For Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts. But other actions by the governor could be construed as raising taxes, experts have previously told PolitiFact New Jersey. Although rates for income, sales and corporate business taxes have not gone up under Christie, Christie has cut funding to several tax credit programs that have the same effect as tax increases. Here’s one example: New Jersey scaled back the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit -- which the state Treasury Department website said "reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey" -- in Christie’s first year in office. Although rates didn’t increase, some homeowners and some low-income individuals received less money to offset tax bills – and that’s a type of increase, professors from the University of California Davis School of Law, and at The George Washington University, told us. Bill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, said at the time that "the Earned Income Tax Credit in most cases really represents a subsidy payment to low income citizens," pointing out that more than 76 percent of earned income tax credit recipients in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax. Next, let’s review that claim about New Jersey having the best job growth in 12 years, amounting to about 130,000 new private-sector jobs. The claim is accurate, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. New Jersey saw an inrease of 66,400 total payroll jobs from December 2011 through 2012. There is no other annual timeframe, measured from December to December, that had as high an increase in the previous 12 years, said Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The state also had the best year-over-year increase in private-sector jobs from December 2011 to December 2012, at 59,100, he said. New Jersey also added 127,800 private sector jobs from February 2010 – Christie’s first full month in office -- through March 2013, Seneca said in an e-mail. Seneca said Christie’s bipartisan efforts to control costs, not raise taxes and to reduce inefficiences that increase business costs all factor into New Jersey’s improving business climate. Our ruling A new ad by Christie for Governor claims that under the governor’s leadership, the state has had "four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever." It’s true that Christie has balanced four budgets -- as required by state law, but some experts have told us that cuts in tax credit programs can be deemed tax increases. In terms of job gains, the news is positive for year-over-year data, growth in the past decade and since Christie’s been in office. A Rutgers economist confirmed that some of Christie’s actions are responsible for those gains. We rate these claims Mostly True. Read Part 2 of our fact-check of this ad on Sunday.

pomt-14971	The Washington D.C.-area "never has a recession."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/19/mike-huckabee/huckabee-says-dc-region-never-has-recession/	When the rest of the nation is in economic agony, metropolitan Washington doesn’t feel the pain. So says Mike Huckabee, a Republican presidential candidate and the former governor of Arkansas. Here are his comments during a recent interview with John Fredericks, a Hampton Roads radio talk show host. "John, you’re close to the Beltway. I don’t have to tell you, it’s the only economy in America that never has a recession," Huckabee said during a call-in interview on the show. "Six out of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C." We recently looked at Huckabee’s claim that a half-dozen of the 10 wealthiest counties surround D.C. We rated that as True, based on median household income -- a standard way to measure county-wide affluence. Since the D.C. area includes Northern Virginia - an economic engine for the rest of the state - we wondered if it’s correct that the capital region has been recession-proof. We emailed the Huckabee campaign three times seeking evidence, but no one replied. The basic definition of a recession is a "marked slippage" of economic activity, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Economists look at a range of things including personal income growth and employment data to determine if there’s been a downturn. One of the most widely cited definitions of a recession is whether there’s been two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced. For the Beltway economy, we looked at Washington and 15 surrounding counties - an area on which analysts typically focus when measuring the economic health of the region. Adam Goldin, an economist at Moody’s Analytics, a company that assesses economic data, told us it’s incorrect to say the D.C. area hasn’t had a recession. The company’s data show the region experienced consecutive quarters of declining GDP during the 2007-09 Great Recession as well in the early 1980s and early 1990s, Goldin said. "(During) the Great Recession, D.C. was certainly impacted like the rest of the country," Goldin said. The Bureau of Economic Analysis has tracked the growth of every metro region in the nation since 2001; that’s long enough to examine the D.C. area’s economy amid the Great Recession. The figures show D.C. regional growth stalled twice. From 2008 to 2009, the value of all goods and services produced in the region fell slightly from $414.6 billion to $414.3 billion - a drop just shy of one-tenth of 1 percent, according to the BEA. By comparison, the U.S. economy declined 2.8 percent between those years. Output in the D.C. area barely dropped, from $434.5 billion to $434.4 billion, from 2012 to 2013, and the BEA figures list the growth rate then as 0 percent between those years. Although D.C. growth was flat at that time, the U.S. economy grew 1.5 percent from 2012 to 2013. The figures show D.C.’s recent annual GDP declines have been very light. "That doesn’t mean there weren’t a couple of really bad quarters in there," said Terry Clower, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University. Clower told us that, contrary to Huckabee’s statement, the D.C. area does experience downturns. "The presence of the federal government does provide a bit of insulation. It doesn’t prevent us from going into recession," Clower said. "Certainly, we have recessions in this region." Still, Clower doesn’t completely fault Huckabee, noting that it is true that the D.C. region long has had shallower downturns than other parts of the U.S., due to the presence of the federal government. But he said there’s a flip side to that reality, he said. "In a time when you start talking about a federal (government) shutdown here, federal employees quit being paid, it affects this area quite a bit," Clower said. We also spoke to Anirban Basu, chairman and CEO of the Sage Policy Group, a Baltimore-based economic consulting group. He said that, beyond GDP data, job creation and retail sales figures also show metro D.C. experienced a downturn during the Great Recession. Basu said there’s "no question" the D.C. area experiences recessions, but he echoed Clower’s sentiments that its downturns tend to be milder than the rest of the country because of the presence of the federal government and associated spending. Our ruling Huckabee said the metropolitan Washington area "never has a recession." Data from Moody’s Analytics show the region has had consecutive quarters of GDP retraction - a common measure of recession - three times in the past four decades. Three economists said the region has experienced downturns, albeit not as deep as most of the nation. We rate Huckabee’s claim False.

pomt-06434	"This is the first time in our state, and one of the first times in the country, where benefit reductions . . . has happened to people who are retired."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/23/george-nee/rhode-island-afl-cio-president-george-nee-says-red/	One of the more controversial elements of the pension legislation proposed by Governor Lincoln Chafee and General Treasurer Gina Raimondo calls for freezing cost of living increases for people currently receiving a state pension. The COLAs, in most cases now 3 percent, would be frozen at least until the system reaches adequate funding, which could be decades. At a Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce breakfast on Oct. 19, 2011, George Nee, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, suggested that such a freeze would be unprecedented, at least in the state. "This is the first time in our state, and one of the first times in the country, where benefit reductions -- and the suspension of the COLA, in our opinion, is a benefit reduction -- has happened to people who are retired," he said. Would the change really be as historic as Nee claims? We're going to assume that Nee is talking about public pensions, not private pensions. We immediately thought of the City of Central Falls, where retiree pensions were recently cut up to 50 percent as a result of bankruptcy proceedings, making national news. (And in September 2009, the bankrupt town of Pritchard, Ala., stopped sending pension checks to its 150 retirees.) But because Nee made his comments in the context of proposed cuts in state employee pensions, let’s focus on the portion of his claim that concerns other states. Nee told us in an e-mail that benefits for retirees have been cut in three states -- Colorado, Minnesota and South Dakota. That, he said, would make Rhode Island "one of the first" to enact such cuts. But according to Stephen Fehr, a researcher for the Pew Center on the States, those three states enacted COLA limits last year. Since then, New Jersey, Maine, Oklahoma and Washington have also frozen, restricted or eliminated cost of living increases for current retirees. (Retirees in five of the seven have gone to court to overturn the action. Judges in Colorado and Minnesota already have upheld the COLA cut, Fehr said. Whether further challenges are successful will depend, in part, on whether the pensions were created through contract, through the state's constitution, or, as is the case in Rhode Island, through state law. A lawsuit filed by Rhode Island unions over pension changes in 2009 and 2010 is pending in Superior Court.) Limiting or eliminating COLAs for existing retirees would not make Rhode Island "one of the first" to do it, as Nee says. We'd be the eighth out of 50. Now let's move to Rhode Island itself. If the Raimondo-Chafee package were to be approved, would it be the first time Rhode Island has cut benefits to its retirees? In 2010, the General Assembly passed -- and Gov. Donald Carcieri signed into law -- legislation limiting cost-of-living increases to the first $35,000 of retirement income. That would clearly be a benefit reduction to retired people whose checks will total more than $35,000 per year (a benchmark that goes up with inflation). But that law did not apply to people who were already retired, or eligible for retirement when it was enacted. And although it required newly-retired workers to wait until their third anniversary (or age 65, whichever was later) to get their first COLA, workers were already required to wait until the third January after their retirement before their cost-of-living adjustments kicked in. Our ruling Nee, referring to the current proposal to scale back pension benefits, said "this is the first time in our state, and one of the first times in the country, where benefit reductions . . . have happened to people who are retired." We’ll give him a pass on the glaring exception of Central Falls, since he was talking about state plans. Nor is it one of the first times for state plans in the United States. Seven states -- 14 percent -- have already done it. But Nee was correct in noting that previous pension changes had no effect on the people who already had retired at the time. And if the Raimondo-Chafee proposal is passed, it would be the first time that benefits for already-retired public employees would be cut, making that part of his statement true. Overall, we rate Nee's statement as Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-08507	"Since Debbie Halvorson has been in politics, Illinois has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/07/adam-kinzinger/adam-kinzinger-says-hundreds-thousands-illinois-jo/	With unemployment rates near their post-World War II highs, it's no surprise that challengers have been attacking incumbents for the nation's weak employment numbers. One who's taken that tack is Adam Kinzinger, the Republican nominee running against Rep. Debbie Halvorson, D-Ill., in a sprawling district south of Chicago. In a recent television ad, Kinzinger said, in part, "Since Debbie Halvorson has been in politics, Illinois has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs." We thought it would be worth checking Kinzinger's numbers. Checking the claim seemed like it would be straightforward. But we hit some unexpected twists that first had us thinking the claim would be False, then True, then somewhere in the middle. The first thing we did was to turn to Halvorson's official biography to determine when she first entered politics. From 1993 to 1996, she served a term as clerk of Crete Township, Illinois. In 1996, she ran for state Senate and won, serving until 2008, including three years as the chamber's majority leader. Then, in 2008, Halvorson was elected to her first, and current, term in the U.S. House. While some may balk at describing the job of Crete Township clerk as being "in politics" -- a Kinzinger spokesman noted that the position has little or no influence on the statewide economy -- it is an elected position serving a geographical entity with 26,650 residents. So by our book, that counts as being "in politics." Next, we went to our trusted source for employment and unemployment statistics -- the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS calculates a wide variety of employment indicators, both nationally and within each state. We looked up the non-farm, seasonally adjusted employment figures for Illinois, which is the broadest, most widely used job statistic. Economists typically count "lost jobs" by comparing the total employment on one date to the total employment on another date. If you count from 1993 until today, the state of Illinois gained a net 310,500 jobs. Repeat: Gained, not lost. Now, to be fair, we also noticed that if you were to start counting from Halvorson's swearing-in as a state senator in 1997, the state had lost 135,000 jobs. And if you were to start at the beginning of her term in Congress, the state had lost 208,000 jobs. But counting from the start of Halvorson's political career in 1993, which we determined was the most accurate approach, the claim appeared to be False. That is, until the Kinzinger camp provided some alternative numbers. A Kinzinger spokesman sent us to a web page posted by the Illinois Department of Employment Security. This page provided a new statistic -- the actual number of unemployed Illinois residents, measured every month from January 1976 until the present. According to these statistics, there were 449,300 unemployed people in Illinois in January 1993, and that number had grown to 671,400 by August 2010. That's 222,100 more unemployed people today than when Halvorson started. So using that measurement, it appeared Kinzinger was correct. Why the difference? The expanding labor force. Since January 1993, the Illinois labor force has grown by 598,800 people, as people have moved into the state and as Illinois children have grown old enough to begin working. So that makes it possible for there to be more unemployed people even as the state has experienced a net gain of jobs. So does this mean the statement should be rated True? Not necessarily. The numbers cited by the Kinzinger camp refer to the increasing number of unemployed people in Illinois. But that doesn't exactly mean that hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost. Instead, it could mean that the state has failed to create hundreds of thousands of jobs to keep pace with population growth and new entrants into the work force. That's a similar point, but it's not exactly the same thing. The ad compounds the confusion by using an on-screen visual to back up Kinzinger's jobs claim. It says, "683,682 out of work," which is the number of unemployed Illinois residents in July 2010, according to the Illinois Department of Employment Security. Here's the problem: Not only is that not a jobs-lost figure, it's also a snapshot of one month's unemployment, even though the ad is talking about the jobs lost over a nearly 18-year period. Kinzinger would have been entirely justified making an ad that said the state had lost 135,000 jobs since Halvorson had been elected to the legislature, or 208,000 jobs since she was elected to Congress. Certainly it would have made for an easier fact-check. But he didn't. Instead, we're left with one valid statistic that the state gained 310,500 jobs during Halvorson's political career, and another statistic that shows that the state's economy fell far behind in creating enough jobs to keep up with population growth. The math can be complicated, but this one adds up to Half True.	None	Adam Kinzinger	None	None	None	2010-10-07T10:07:49	2010-09-21	['Illinois']
pomt-05803	"Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/23/bill-proctor/rep-proctor-says-half-high-school-grads-cant-read-/	In 2011, Florida state legislators approved a bill to link teacher pay to student performance. Despite resistance from some educators, including a lawsuit filed by the teachers’ union, state Rep. Bill Proctor, R-St. Augustine, stood firm behind Senate Bill 736. Proctor is the chair of a House education committee and chancellor at Flagler College. "Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level, and grade level isn’t that difficult," Proctor said in comments to the St. Augustine Record. "We’ll see which teachers affect learning in their students." We were surprised by that statistic: Do half of Florida’s high school graduates head off to college or work without reading at grade level? Florida’s seniors aren’t tested for reading skills as they don their caps and gowns. But we found two compelling pieces of evidence that indicate Proctor is probably right. FCAT and college entrance exams Florida high school students take the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT, in the 10th grade. Proctor’s office sent us to the most-recent 10th grade FCAT results. A "3 or higher" is considered reading at grade level. During the 2010-11 school year, only 39 percent of nearly 186,000 10th graders scored that well. But 60 percent passed the test, which means it’s possible to pass the test and read below grade level. Students are required to pass the 10th grade FCAT to graduate. Students who fail have two opportunities per year to retake the test which would ultimately boost that 39 percent figure who scored at grade level. The retest data mixes students from different years, though, so we can’t give a definitive number for how many more students passed the FCAT in a specific graduating class. "Yes, we graduate students that cannot read on 10th grade reading level," said Lindy Smith, an aide to Proctor, in an email. "Of those students passing the 10th grade Reading FCAT, I do not know how many actually graduated - but as you know students must pass 10th grade Reading FCAT in order to graduate. We expect some growth in reading in grades 11 and 12 but do not test those results on FCAT." The other piece of evidence came from the Florida Department of Education. Staff there pointed us to a December 2011 report on school assessment standards. The report stated that to be "college ready" students must graduate from high school, take certain courses and demonstrate basic literary skills. During the 2009-10 school year, 55 percent of the graduating seniors scored college ready for reading based on the ACT, SAT or CPT (The CPT, or College Placement Test, is primary used for the state’s public community colleges.) That number, too, supports Proctor’s claim. Experts on testing and education If the number of students reading at grade level is so abysmally low, why the repeated push for testing? We posed that question to Matthew Ladner, a senior advisor of policy and research for the Foundation for Excellence in Education (chaired by former Gov. Jeb Bush). Ladner coauthored Report Card on American Education: Ranking State K-12 Performance, Progress and Reform for the American Legislative Exchange Council. Without the testing, Florida wouldn’t have a measurement of its students’ performance, he said. And although no one is happy about that 39 percent figure of students reading at grade level in the 10th grade, Florida has made gains. Ladner pointed to the National Assessment of Education Progress which tests samples of students. Florida’s fourth grade reading results were below the national average in 1998, but climbed enough by 2011 to be above the national average. "What you find is while there is still plenty of room for improvement in Florida, there has been a large amount of progress in the right direction," he said. We also spoke with Robert Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, a national organization which advocates for better forms of assessment. Schaeffer said that Proctor’s claim sounded accurate, but he said that what constitutes "grade level" isn’t objective criteria. "Grade level is a political construct," he said. "If you gave the FCAT to many competent adults they would fail." Schaeffer also said that the SAT and other college entrance exams are given to students who are already college bound, so that measure doesn’t provide a full picture -- for example students who have dropped out. The State Board of Education approves the achievement level descriptions for FCAT 2.0. Our ruling Proctor said "Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level." The results for 10th grade reading FCAT show only 39 percent at grade level. Some additional students met that grade level mark through retests or by a sufficient score on the SAT or ACT, which would boost that 39 percent figure. Another way to measure Proctor’s claim is by looking at the percentage who were deemed college ready for reading based on college entrance exams, and that figure was 55 percent for 2009-10. By both measurements, the figure is close to 50 percent. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Proctor	None	None	None	2012-02-23T08:17:26	2012-01-06	['None']
pomt-01515	Americans now "support strikes (against ISIS) but the support for ground troops is not there. The support is very thin."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/21/katrina-vanden-heuvel/katrina-vanden-heuvel-americans-support-air-strike/	Progressives, wary of another open-ended conflict in the Middle East, are concerned President Barack Obama is bending to war hawks in Washington by using the military to stop the march of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. On ABC’s This Week, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of the left-leaning magazine The Nation, said Obama has moved away from his foreign policy principle of "don’t do stupid stuff" and "surrendered to war party in both parties, to a media that has lathered up hysteria about a threat that is not an immediate threat to this country." She questioned whether Americans are on board with increased military involvement. "There's a barbarism and a gruesomeness to the videotapes (of the Islamic State beheading two American journalists) which have moved the American people at this stage to support strikes, but the support for ground troops is not there," vanden Heuvel said. "The support is very thin." Did vanden Heuvel accurately capture the sentiment from Americans? We decided to take a look at the polling data. Airstrikes At Obama’s direction, the military began a targeted airstrike campaign in Iraq earlier this month against the Islamic State, a terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria that is also called ISIS or ISIL. We found a number of recent surveys that asked respondents how they felt about this decision. As vanden Heuvel suggested, there’s significant majority support for airstrikes. According to a CNN poll published Sept. 8, 76 percent of Americans backed additional airstrikes against the Islamic State. Just 23 percent opposed. The results were consistent with several other recent polls. Washington Post/ABC News (Sept. 4-7) Reuters/Ipsos (Sept. 10-12) Huffington Post/YouGov (Sept. 18-19) Strongly support 52 42 34 Somewhat support 19 22 32 Strongly oppose 11 12 10 Somewhat oppose 12 9 9 Other 6 16 16 Vanden Heuvel also said that the Islamic State’s beheading of two American journalists was the tipping point for public support of airstrikes. The videos contained a "barbarism and a gruesomeness" that "moved" Americans to back Obama on this, she said. However, polls don’t exactly bear that out. A Washington Post/ABC poll from Aug. 13-17, found majority support, 54 percent, for airstrikes against the Islamic State. That poll was conducted before Aug. 19, when the Islamic State released footage of a Sunni insurgent beheading journalist James Foley. A Pew Research Center/USA Today poll released Aug. 18 -- also before the videos were released -- showed 54 percent of Americans supported airstrikes while just 34 percent opposed. Even earlier in the summer, the country was split on whether to launch airstrikes. A Washington Post/ABC poll from June 22 found 45 percent of respondents backed airstrikes and 46 percent opposed them. So it’s not as though the pro-airstrike crowd was weak months before the beheadings, either. While support for airstrikes jumped in the aftermath of the gruesome videos, it was already building and above 50 percent before news outlets learned two journalists were beheaded. Ground troops Obama has vowed not to get American troops directly involved in combat in Iraq and Syria. Polls are mixed, but it does not seem that there’s a great appetite for "boots on the ground," as some may say. The September Reuters poll allowed respondents to select multiple actions they deemed appropriate for America to take to fight the Islamic State. Choices ranged from humanitarian aid to no intervention at all. Just 9 percent of respondents favored sending troops, easily the least-chosen option. Similarly, CNN found two-thirds of Americans opposed ground troops while about one-third supported it. The Huffington Post/YouGov poll (the most-recent poll we found) had a far less definitive result. Asked if they would support or oppose ground troops in Iraq and Syria to fight the Islamic State, 38 percent expressed some support while 44 percent were against it. So a plurality opposed the move, but it was much closer than other surveys. On This Week, vanden Heuvel embellished a bit when she said support for ground troops to fight the Islamic State was "not there" and "very thin," but her general point is on target. Polls found at least a plurality opposed sending combat troops to fight the Islamic State. Our ruling Vanden Heuvel said Americans now "support strikes (to fight the Islamic State) but the support for ground troops is not there. The support is very thin." In general, vanden Heuvel captures the sentiment of the American people. But she over-exaggerates the influence of videos showing beheadings of journalists on Americans' attitudes about airstrikes. There was already majority support for airstrikes before the killing of the first journalist, James Foley. It is also a stretch to say support for ground troops is "not there" or "very thin." It is a minority opinion, but at least two polls show one-third of Americans support the idea. On balance, we rate her claim Half True.

pomt-07344	"The only people in this town that have voted to cut Medicare spending are the people who voted in favor of Obamacare. That’s a fact."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/may/10/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-those-who-voted-federal-healt/	On May 1, 2011, Sen. Marco Rubio appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press to discuss everything from his take on Donald Trump’s presidential aspirations to the crisis in Libya. During the nearly 10-minute interview, Rubio was asked by host David Gregory for his thoughts on fellow Republican Rep. Paul Ryan’s proposal to overhaul the nation’s Medicare system. Ryan’s proposal calls for a voucher-type system -- where, starting in 2022, those 65 and older would chose from a private health insurance plan, but the government would contribute a certain amount toward their premiums. The House passed Ryan's budget plan, including his Medicare proposal, on April 15 by a vote of 235 to 193. "Would you vote for the Ryan plan?" Gregory asked. "I will support any plan that saves Medicare, doesn’t impact current seniors and doesn’t hurt economic growth. The Ryan plan does that," Rubio responded. The freshman senator then went on to say: "The Ryan plan doesn’t cut Medicare. Actually, it increases funding in it. And the only people in this town that have voted to cut Medicare are the people that supported Obamacare, that cut half a trillion dollars over the next 10 years out of Medicare and is using it to fund a health care experiment somewhere outside of Medicare." Medicare cuts are an issue PolitiFact has covered extensively on the national level and in other states. So we wondered, once again, how accurate Rubio was in stating that those who voted for the federal health care law, in essence, voted to cut Medicare? Medicare First some background on how the Medicare system was affected by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act. Under the act, Congress voted to reduce $500 billion in projected Medicare spending over the next 10 years, not in one substantial chunk. The reductions are aimed at eliminating parts of the Medicare program seen as ineffective or wasteful. For example, the plan phases out payments to the Medicare Advantage program, an optional program set up under the George W. Bush administration, where seniors could opt to enroll in a private insurance program and the federal government would subsidize a portion of their premium. On the surface, it may seem that lawmakers voted to cut Medicare spending under the new health law, but they instead cut the rate of growth. As a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office notes, the amount of spending for Medicare will continue to increase over the next decade, from $499 billion in 2009 to $929 billion in 2020. And even though $500 billion in spending is being reduced, health care experts say the quality of care should not be shortchanged. "Some (reforms) increase Medicare spending to improve benefits and coverage," said Tricia Neuman, vice president and director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, in a video on the foundation’s website. "Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending to help the program operate more efficiently and help fund coverage expansions to the uninsured in the underlying health reform legislation," Neuman said. "Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care." Ryan plan While Rubio said he would support any plan that "saves Medicare," he also said that "Medicare as we now have it is not an option" because of the cost. Ryan’s plan would completely overhaul the Medicare system. Currently, any senior 65 or older is eligible for Medicare, which provides health care coverage for the vast amount of elderly Americans. The program provides health insurance for 39 million seniors and another 8 million people under the age of 65 receiving Social Security benefits. Under Ryan’s plan, starting in 2022 seniors would choose a private health insurance plan from a designated "Medicare exchange." The federal government would contribute an average of about $8,000 toward the annual premium for the private insurance plan. Ryan notes that this will result in a cost savings. But a CBO report notes that while government spending for beneficiaries would go down, the burden would then fall on beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket to cover the rest of their medical expenses. "To summarize, a typical beneficiary would spend more for health care under the (Ryan) proposal than under CBO’s long-term scenarios for several reasons," the CBO report states. "First, private plans would cost more than traditional Medicare because of the net effect of differences in payment rates for providers, administrative costs and utilization of health care services. … Second, the government’s contribution would grow more slowly than health care costs, leaving more for beneficiaries to pay." For example under Ryan’s proposal, according to the CBO, the cost to buy private insurance in 2022 would be about $20,510 a year. Even with the estimated $8,000 federal subsidy, the senior would still have to pay the difference of $12,510, about $1,000 more a month. Compare that to the Medicare program under the current health care law, the estimated cost to provide insurance would be about $14,770 in 2022, according to the CBO. That would leave the senior to pay just $6,150 out of pocket -- about $500 a month. Ryan’s plan, as noted in this news article from the Associated Press, also intends to keep the $500 billion in reductions that Republicans have criticized Democrats for approving under the Obama plan. How does that all add up? Neither the current law nor the Ryan plan would "cut" Medicare. Under both plans, the money allocated for Medicare in the budget would continue to grow for the next 10 years. The reduction -- under both plans -- is only in the rate of growth. Both Ryan's plan and the health care law would decrease the rate of growth. So what was Rubio speaking about? Rubio's position We turned to Rubio press secretary Alex Burgos to get a better understanding of Rubio’s take. "The Medicare cuts under ObamaCare are already current law," Burgos wrote in an e-mail on May 5, 2011. "They are part of CBO's baseline. It does not follow that supporting the Ryan budget is the same as supporting the Medicare cuts in ObamaCare." Burgos referred us to a statement made by Ryan press secretary Conor Sweeney to the Associated Press on April 13, 2011. Sweeney states that Ryan’s plan "ensures that all current-law savings and future reforms are devoted to saving Medicare." Burgos made it a point to underline "current-law savings." Still we wondered, aren’t the "current-law savings" Ryan's office touts a result of the same "cuts" to Medicare Sen. Rubio was referring to in his interview? Not according to Burgos, who counters that under the current health law, "that money is being cut from Medicare to fund a health care experiment outside of Medicare," Burgos responded. The "experiment," Burgos said, is the federal health care law approved last year. "The Ryan budget acknowledges these current cuts as the law, but ensures that money is preserved within Medicare," Burgos said. So Rubio's position is that what he calls a "cut" under the current law isn't a cut when it's included in the Ryan plan because it's already the law. The Ryan budget, however, is fairly explicit that it is reducing future spending in the Medicare program with the aim of restoring balance to the federal budget. If the Democratic health care law reduced future Medicare spending in order to expand coverage to the uninsured, then the Republican plan reduces future Medicare spending in order to reduce the deficit. In both cases, future Medicare spending is being reduced in order for the parties to pursue other policy goals. Our ruling So back to the question. Was Rubio accurate in stating that those who voted for the federal health care law, in essence, voted to cut Medicare? To his credit, during his interview, Rubio did state that the cuts would be spread out over the next 10 years, instead of making it seem like the money would come out of the current-year budget. However, Rubio still identifies those who voted for the federal health care law as those who voted to "cut Medicare," without noting that spending on the program is still expected to increase. The vote taken by Congress was not to cut Medicare but to reduce the rate of growth by $500 billion by targeting inefficiencies in the program. That's a cost-reduction plan that Ryan himself kept intact in his own budget proposal. Republicans, meanwhile, voted for a budget plan that envisions spending less on Medicare in the future to restore fiscal balance to the federal budget and reduce the deficit. Both parties have voted -- at different times and on different proposals -- to reduce future spending for Medicare. We rate Rubio’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05427	Says "Bill Pascrell voted to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires, and I voted no."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/30/steve-rothman/rep-steve-rothman-claims-rep-bill-pascrell-voted-e/	When it comes to protecting the middle class, U.S. Rep. Steve Rothman makes it sound like U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell isn’t the fighter he claims to be. As the two Democrats prepare to face off in the June 5 primary to represent a newly drawn congressional district in northern New Jersey, Rothman criticized Pascrell in a recent YouTube video for voting "to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires." "The people of the district really are looking for a progressive Democrat, and they’re looking for somebody who will fight for them," said Rothman, speaking from the Plaza Diner in Bergen County during the video posted April 18 by NorthJersey.com. "So when people in the middle class wanted their representative to fight for them and not give away the store to the super rich in America, Bill Pascrell voted to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires, and I voted no." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Rothman’s claim does not have much truth behind it, and it’s deeply misleading. Pascrell voted in June 2000 for a bill to gradually repeal the federal estate tax. But after President Bill Clinton vetoed the legislation, the congressman reversed his position and rejected the bill about three months later. Pascrell also opposed subsequent efforts to eliminate the estate tax on at least seven occasions during the administration of President George W. Bush. The estate tax is levied against the transfer of wealth following a person’s death. Paul Swibinski, a senior advisor to the Rothman campaign, argued the claim is accurate: "The fact that Bill Pascrell flip flopped and voted both for and against eliminating the estate tax proves that he is not a consistent, reliable supporter of progressive issues." First, let’s explain Pascrell’s yes vote in 2000. In June 2000, Pascrell voted in favor of the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000, which would have repealed the estate tax by Jan. 1, 2010. Rothman voted against the bill. The House failed to override Clinton’s veto in September 2000, when Pascrell and Rothman both voted against the bill and overriding the president’s veto. Pascrell spokesman Sean Darcy told us the congressman originally supported the estate tax repeal in 2000 because at that time, the tax "put an undue burden on middle class taxpayers like small business owners." At the time of the override vote, Pascrell noted on the House floor that Clinton would work out a solution to ease the burden on the middle class, Darcy said in an e-mail. Darcy added: "True to form, while Bill Pascrell has been fighting for middle class taxpayers on the Ways and Means Committee and the floor of the House, Steve Rothman was nowhere to be found." From that point on, the two congressmen continued to oppose estate tax repeal efforts. In April 2001, Pascrell and Rothman voted against the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2001, a measure to gradually repeal the estate tax. Provisions of that bill were included in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which Pascrell and Rothman opposed in May 2001. Signed into law in June 2001, that legislation repealed the estate tax for individuals who die in 2010, and then reinstated it in 2011. On at least five occasions between 2002 and 2007, the two congressmen voted against permanently repealing the estate tax. The existing regulations were part of a tax cut deal reached in late 2010 by President Barack Obama and Congress, with Pascrell’s and Rothman’s support. Our ruling In a video posted April 18 on YouTube, Rothman claimed "Bill Pascrell voted to eliminate all estate taxes for billionaires, and I voted no." Pascrell did vote in June 2000 for a bill to gradually repeal the estate tax, but after Clinton vetoed the legislation, the congressman reversed his position and rejected the bill in September 2000. In subsequent years, Pascrell voted against repealing the estate tax on at least seven occasions. Since Rothman’s claim "ignores critical facts that would give a different impression," his statement is Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04986	Says he could be "the first president in modern history to be outspent."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/20/barack-obama/obama-says-he-could-be-first-president-modern-hist/	In the spring of 2012, headlines blared about President Barack Obama’s "hefty cash advantage." By June, once Republicans had settled on Mitt Romney, the story had changed to this: "Romney’s fund-raising outpaces president’s." Obama used the news to appeal to donors in a June 26 fundraising plea: "I will be the first president in modern history to be outspent in his re-election campaign, if things continue as they have so far. I'm not just talking about the super PACs and anonymous outside groups -- I'm talking about the Romney campaign itself. Those outside groups just add even more to the underlying problem." We researched whether Obama’s team could be outraised by Romney and concluded that there are too many unknowns to determine if his prediction will come true. (Read our extended analysis of the issue.) We could determine, though, if there had been any president in modern history to be outspent in his re-election campaign. We looked at two races involving Democratic incumbents facing Republican challengers: President Jimmy Carter vs. Ronald Reagan in 1980 and President Bill Clinton vs. Bob Dole in 1996. These examples contradict Obama’s point. But a simple comparison of the numbers doesn’t tell the full story. The earlier races both occurred when candidates accepted public financing for general election campaigns. The public financing system, began in the wake of the Watergate scandal, gave each candidate a set amount of money to spend after the primary and before the general election. Obama opted out of that system in both 2008 and 2012 because he could raise more money on his own. 1980: Carter vs. Reagan We shared Obama’s claim with Bob Biersack, a former longtime official at the Federal Election Commission who now works for the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan center that tracks campaign fundraising. He suggested we look back at the 1980 race. The Federal Election Commission dug up a report for us that showed that Reagan outraised Carter in the primary: $28.3 million to $19.6 million, which includes some federal matching funds. For the general election, both candidates participated in public campaign financing, said Georgetown government professor Clyde Wilcox in an email. "Carter’s popularity was low, and he had just won a divided primary election against Kennedy," said Wilcox. "Reagan faced a number of competitors in a divisive context that lasted months. So it makes sense that he raised more money." An FEC press release about political party spending for the 1980 election stated that "Republican Party committees at the national, state and local levels spent almost five times as much money as their Democratic counterparts." 1996: Clinton vs. Dole FEC records for the 1996 presidential race show Dole raised $44.9 million, while Clinton raised $42.5 million during the primaries, which included public matching funds. But Dole was at a disadvantage, because he had to spend money to fend off primary challengers, while Clinton faced no Democratic challengers. They both took a federal grant of about $62 million for the general election. The Republican national, state and local party committees outraised the Democrats in hard money, and Republican national party committees also raised more than the Democrats in soft money, about $138 million to $124 million. But most of that money didn’t go to the presidential race, said Wilcox. (Soft money allowed donors to bypass contribution limits. See the FEC description about soft money.) "All of Clinton’s money went against Dole," Wilcox said. "Most of Dole’s money went against his GOP rivals." Fundraising totals don’t tell the full story, though. It’s also important to look at the amount of cash candidates had on hand close to Election Day. By that measure, Clinton was far ahead: He had $31 million in the bank 20 days before the election, while Dole had $16.7 million, the Miami Herald reported in 1996. Comparing numbers doesn’t tell the full story Just as it’s not a simple exercise of comparing numbers for the 1980 and 1996 races, it’s also not simple to look at fundraising for the general election of 2012. Obama’s side is ahead so far. But Republicans have gained momentum, and with multi-millionaire donors and super PACs in the mix, the final tally won’t be known for months. Obama and Romney are both forgoing public financing. "It is not really fair to compare the publicly funded races to what we have now," said Brendan Glavin, data manager for the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan organization that analyzes campaign spending. "The Reagan-Carter race was publicly funded evenly on both sides. The money that Reagan raised was nearly all spent in the primary race against George Bush," he said. "Similarly, Carter was fighting off a challenge from Ted Kennedy. Also, at that time the distinction between primary and general election was stronger. George Bush dropped out of the race in late May 1980 and the convention was in mid July." Obama is technically wrong, said University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato, but the fundraising landscape is different. "You are really operating under a very different -- maybe completely different -- campaign finance universe," Sabato said. "That doesn’t make his statement right. If he had said he’d be the first president under the new system of campaign finance to be outspent in his re-election campaign that would be right." Sabato, who predicts election outcomes on his Crystal Ball website, said he doesn’t know for certain that Obama will be outraised but predicts that he will be outraised by "sizable margins" due to the super PACs. In both the 1980 and 1996 races, the fundraising difference wasn’t that significant, Sabato said. "Yes, Reagan outspent Carter, but that had nothing to do with Carter’s loss. Carter’s loss was about two recessions, the economy and the Iranian hostage crisis," Sabato said. And the 1996 race doesn’t account for the labor movement’s work, which is off the books. Their get-out-the-vote efforts benefited Democrats. "Clinton consistently led by a mile in the polls -- it was good economy, peace. There was never any question Clinton was going to win," Sabato said. Sabato told us if we compare those earlier races to Obama-Romney in 2012, we’re not quite comparing apples and oranges, but we are comparing oranges and tangerines. Our ruling Obama was wrong to suggest that there hadn’t been other presidents in modern history to be outraised in their re-elections. Looking at numbers alone, Carter and Clinton fall into that category. But what we are comparing is primary races then with total fundraising for the general election now. We think 1980 and 1996 certainly fall under "modern history," but the campaign finance picture has changed dramatically since then, and there are important caveats to those races. Those earlier races involved public financing -- this time Obama and Romney are forgoing those dollars. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05549	An effort to repeal voting-reform legislation would be "the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/09/eric-kearney/eric-kearney-says-repeal-voter-reform-legislation-/	A bill to reform Ohio election laws, House Bill 194, has been a consistent source of controversy since it was introduced last year. The latest flap came on March 28 when the Ohio Senate passed a bill to repeal the law, which Democrats and others have called a "voter suppression" bill. Although they oppose HB 194, largely because it restricts early voting opportunities, Democrats also spoke out against the bill’s repeal because there already is a referendum on HB 194 scheduled for this fall’s ballot. Sen. Eric Kearney, who leads the Senate’s Democratic caucus, said voters have the right to decide the fate HB 194. He said Republicans were unconstitutionally taking away their right to referendum by repealing the law before the election on Nov. 6. "This is the first time in Ohio history where a bill has been passed to stop a referendum," Kearney, of Cincinnati, said during the floor debate March 28. The GOP-controlled Senate passed the bill to repeal HB 194 on a party-line vote that day, sending the bill to the House of Representatives for consideration. Anytime an elected official utters the words "this is the first time in Ohio history," we at PolitiFact Ohio become instantly curious. So we decided to dig into Kearney’s claim. First, it’s important to recognize that the legislation passed last month, Senate Bill 295, does not directly stop the referendum on HB 194. It essentially nullifies the referendum because it repeals the law, therefore there would be no law to put before voters. Kearney’s larger point – that repealing HB 194 before the referendum vote is unconstitutional – is ripe for debate and, many lawmakers agree, likely will be decided in court if the House also passes SB 295 and the governor signs it. An attempt to verify Kearney’s assertion that the repeal is unprecedented could help shed light on the situation. If the senator is wrong, a similar case could help answer the question of the repeal’s constitutionality. We checked with several government and legal sources and could not find an identical situation in Ohio’s history. The provision to allow Ohioans to challenge a law passed by the General Assembly was included in the Ohio Constitution in 1912, according to a history of ballot issues maintained by the Secretary of State’s office. Mike Rowe, spokesman for the Senate Democratic caucus, said the caucus’ legal staff could not find a similar case despite research that looked at the Ohio Revised Code, legislative records and discussions with staff members. Republicans in the Senate and House also came up empty. Senate GOP spokeswoman Angela Meleca said the caucus’ legal staff, along with the Ohio Legislative Services Commission, looked back and could not find another case of the General Assembly repealing a bill that is up for a referendum. "There was nothing that matched or fit this scenario," Meleca said. Carrie Davis, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio, testified before a Senate committee on March 21 that the Ohio Supreme Court had never addressed the question of repealing a bill up for a referendum. "If we’re all hitting the same wall and not finding anything, I’m not sure it’s there," Davis said in an interview. There was one case with similarities, but it fell short of exactly matching the repeal of HB 194. Lawmakers passed a bill last year to establish new congressional districts. The legislation replaced districts established by an earlier bill, House Bill 319, that spurred a referendum effort backed by Democrats. But when the second bill, House Bill 369, passed with a new map, the referendum effort ceased because the new maps replaced the old ones involved in the referendum. The partial repeal of HB 319 is different, though, because Democrats dropped their bid to collect the signatures needed to get a referendum on the ballot. In the case of HB 194, Secretary of State Jon Husted last year certified that petitioners met the requirements to place the referendum on the November ballot. So Kearney appears to be on solid ground. But it is important to remember the bill to repeal HB 194 has not been passed in the House. So the repeal is not official yet, although Republican House Speaker William G. Batchelder supports it. Nevertheless, the experts we talked to all agreed that Kearney’s point that the repeal would be a first in Ohio history is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.

"Breaking: 3 liberal celebrities arrested for conspiracy to assassinate President Trump," said a May 6 headline by Miami Post, a pro-Trump fake news website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story is made up. The story said that "the three liberals were arrested as enemy combatants and brought to a military base due to the danger of mass destruction that may be called domestic terrorism." The story lacked basic details such as where they were supposedly arrested. (Tthere was no mention of Miami or Florida in the article by Miami Post.). If famous celebrities were nabbed for trying to take out Trump, it would be all over the news —-- but it’s only been all over the fake news world. Other fake news stories with the same phony allegations have circulated since 2017. In December 2017, Rogen jokingly tweeted: "This is a right wing news website that says me and Franco and Miley Cyrus got arrested. Luckily they let me tweet from prison. Haha."

pomt-07663	Says Charlotte Nash "pretends to be a chicken farmer" in order to get property tax exemptions.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/11/larry-gause/candidate-says-opponent-using-loophole-get-tax-dea/	Political campaigns are often full of interesting claims, but this one had us chirping. Larry Gause, candidate for chairman of Gwinnett County’s Board of Commissioners, recently sent out a flier and created a website full of claims against opponent Charlotte Nash. The general theme is that Nash, Gwinnett’s administrator from 1995 to 2004, wants to be chair to "feather" the nest of herself and friends. He cites evidence such as Atlanta Journal-Constitution articles that reported a temporary arrangement to pay a retired police chief half of his $138,000 annual salary for a homeland security job that some county commissioners were unaware of. Most of the claims were not new, but one piqued our interest. Gause accused Nash of using a "loophole" to get huge property tax breaks. "How does she do it? She pretends to be a chicken farmer," Gause wrote. Nash laughed off the accusation in a telephone interview, calling it "typical campaign stuff." "It’s a part of the process," she added. Gwinnett is Georgia’s second highest-populated county, and the chairman is the most politically powerful position. A special election for the position, previously held by Charles Bannister, who resigned under pressure, is scheduled for Tuesday. Ethics are a big issue in Gwinnett County politics. One sitting county commissioner, Kevin Kenerly, was indicted last year on bribery charges. Bannister resigned his position last year amid the grand jury investigation that resulted in Kenerly’s indictment. Kenerly voluntarily suspended himself after the indictment. His term ended in December. The race, which has received little attention, is heating up. Norcross resident Joe Newton has filed a complaint with the county’s Board of Assessors, charging Nash is receiving "improper and unjustified tax credits" and wants an investigation. Nash owns two properties under scrutiny. Both are located in Dacula. The larger property is more than 100 acres and has a market value of about $1.1 million, county tax records show. The records show Nash received about $14,000 in exemption savings last year and paid $1,862.74. Gause said Nash is wrongly using a conservation use assessment exemption to get the tax break. The land was once a chicken farm, but it is now used to grow timber -- a legal exemption for the property, according to Gwinnett Tax Assessor Steven Pruitt, who has not endorsed a candidate in the race. The exemptions date back to 2005, county officials said. Nash and her sister inherited the land after their mother died. They applied for the exemption, which gives tax breaks to individuals who use land for conservation purposes for at least 10 years. Land owners who develop the property must pay back twice the tax savings. Pruitt said there are 1,046 properties with exemptions in Gwinnett. Pruitt said you can’t get an exemption if you have just one tree on the property or one horse. Properties larger than 2,000 acres cannot get an exemption. The exemptions must be approved by the county’s Board of Assessors. We toured the site Thursday and saw scores of hardwood trees in the distance, ready for spring. Gause says Nash is not honoring the spirit of the assessment law -- arguing there’s little timber production going on there. Pruitt, however, said it could take 15 to 20 years before it is time to cut and sell the timber. Others we talked to agreed. The other property is about 14 acres. It has a market value of $463,500, according to county records. Nash and her family received about $4,000 in exemptions for the property in 2010, records show. They paid about $2,800 in property taxes. Pruitt said Nash has an agricultural exemption for that property because it is a farm. Gause told us Nash is playing loose with the exemption rules. "I observed the property [twice]," Gause wrote in an e-mail. "There were no animals on the land. Not a horse, cow, pig or chicken. There were no crops growing. There was no farming equipment. I’ve worked on farms. I know what farms look like. Neither property is a farm." We also checked out that site Thursday and didn’t see any animals there. Pruitt said he has seen horses there and notes there is a barn. "That’s how it qualifies [for an exemption]," Pruitt said. A short biography of Nash on a government website says she and her husband live "on a chicken farm in the Harbins Community south of Dacula." But that refers to a long-ago use of the property, Nash said. She said she has never claimed to be a chicken farmer, and her property tax exemptions have nothing to do with poultry. So who’s right here? Nash says the land was once a chicken farm, but it is not anymore. Nash has an exemption for agricultural purposes for the smaller property -- where she is registered to vote -- and an exemption for timber purposes for the larger plot of land, the county assessor told us. The assessor’s office was unable by Thursday to share the original exemption paperwork with us. Gause’s real point is whether Nash actually deserves the agricultural exemption. But he bases his argument on the claim that she "pretends to be a chicken farmer." We found no evidence of that. We rate his statement as False.

pomt-14811	"Instead of fighting ISIS, (the Saudis) have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/24/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-right-saudi-arabia-more-focused-con/	Bernie Sanders delivered his long-awaited speech on democratic socialism last week, also outlining his plan for fighting ISIS. Sanders called for a broad international coalition but stressed that Muslim nations must shoulder the fight, which he called "a struggle for the soul of Islam." So far, he said, wealthy and powerful countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have done very little. "Saudi Arabia, turns out, has the third-largest defense budget in the world," Sanders said on Nov. 19. "Yet instead of fighting ISIS they have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen." Sanders is correct that Saudi Arabia’s military budget is the third largest in the world. But is he also right that the Saudis aren’t prioritizing ISIS? In a word, yes. A striking scaleback The Saudi embassy in Washington did not return our requests for comment. But the Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times article that says, "Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have shifted most of their aircraft to their fight against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen." In 2014, the Houthis — a longstanding Shiite separatist group in northern Yemen, a country with a Sunni majority — rebelled against the Yemeni government and seized the presidential palace. After months of tense peace brokered by the United Nations, the Houthis took over the government and placed the president under house arrest in early 2015. Saudi Arabia, which has a Sunni majority and is ruled by a Sunni monarch, led a 10-state Arab coalition and launched airstrikes against the Houthis on March 26. It pledged to use 100 warplanes and 150,000 soldiers. In a month, the Saudis conducted 2,415 sorties (a deployment of an aircraft), releasing at least 1,000 air-to-ground weapons. Meanwhile, as part of the U.S.-led coalition of 60 countries, Saudi Arabia has also been involved with the international effort against ISIS since September 2014. Since then, it has deployed just four F-15 fighter jets and an unspecified number of Typhoon combat jets against ISIS. (Saudi state media trumpeted the participation, releasing photos of pilots who flew in the strikes and highlighting that the son of King Salman was among them.) Experts said Saudi Arabia doesn’t publicize the exact number of airstrikes it has carried out, but the data shows that the amount of non-U.S. airstrikes overall has been scaled back since the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen began in late March. Conversely, the United States has beefed up its strikes. Here’s a chart from Airwars.org, a project tracking the international air war against ISIS, that demonstrates this point: Data compiled by Airwars.org shows that from Dec. 1, 2014, to Nov. 16, 2015, Arab allies conducted just 143 of the 2,827 airstrikes in Syria, 90 of which occurred before April 3 (intervention in Yemen began March 26). For comparison, Saudi Arabia sometimes conducted as many as 125 strikes a day against the Houthis, according to the BBC. "Bottom line, Bernie Sanders is right. All the evidence points to it," said Chris Woods, an investigative journalist who leads the Airwars project. "Clearly, we saw with the Saudis a capability unleashed in Yemen that we never saw in Syria." "The volume of Saudi military forces deployed to combat the Houthis puts the Saudi deployment against ISIS to shame," said David Weinberg, an expert on the Gulf monarchies at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy. Weinberg looked at tallies from the Defense Department which are consistent with Airwars.org data. He also noted a decline in the number of non-U.S. airstrikes in Syria and "a pitiful lack of participation by America’s Arab allies in what was supposedly unveiled as a joint U.S-Arab effort when it was launched last fall." According to the New York Times article cited by the Sanders campaign, the Saudis flew their last strikes in Syria in September, Jordan in August, and the UAE in March. Conflicting crises Riyadh has its reasons for prioritizing the Houthis over ISIS. Among them: Yemen’s proximity, Iran’s gains in the region, sectarianism and, simply put, practicality. "Yemen is the soft underbelly of the kingdom, and Iranian presence there through its support of Houthis is viewed as an existential threat to the kingdom," said David Ottaway, the Middle East specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center. "In the end, Syria doesn’t border Saudi Arabia like Yemen does," said Lori Plotkin Boghardt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "And more fundamentally, the Saudis view Assad as the root of the ISIS problem and have argued from the beginning that Assad has to be defeated first in order to defeat ISIS." Saudi Arabia is also somewhat relying on the United States to take on ISIS, added Weinberg of the Defense of Democracies. It’s also politically easier for the Sunni kingdom to mobilize public opinion there against radical Shiites like the Houthis rather than radical Sunni terrorists like ISIS, he said. The United States, for its part, supports the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen (the Houthis’ slogan is "Death to America, Death to Israel, Damn the Jews, Victory to Islam"), despite concerns over civilian casualties and possible war crimes. What’s more, Boghardt pointed out, "the irony and the danger" is that the conflict in Yemen has given al-Qaida and ISIS room to operate there. As for ISIS, there’s no question that the Saudis are aware of the threat it poses. The terrorist group has repeatedly targeted the kingdom, bombing mosques and detonating car bombs. Beyond military engagement, the Saudis have foiled terrorist plots and arrested hundreds of ISIS supporters. But experts say the kingdom could be doing a lot more. "Saudi Arabia really should be doing more to militarily combat the twin scourges of ISIS and al-Qaida," Weinberg said. "Bernie Sanders is right that we should expect more from our Saudi allies in the fight against terror in Syria as well as beyond." Our ruling Sanders said, "Instead of fighting ISIS, (the Saudis) have focused more on a campaign to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen." This is an accurate assessment. The Saudis have prioritized the conflict in Yemen over the fight against ISIS, as evidenced by the amount of resources it has committed to both crises. We rate Sanders’ claim True.

pomt-11240	"Mitch McConnell was one of the few senators that voted after Tiananmen Square not to have punitive actions against China for human rights violations."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/03/don-blankenship/fact-checking-don-blankenship-mitch-mcconnell-chin/	In the closing days of West Virginia’s Senate primary, relations between Republicans Don Blankenship and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have turned sour. Blankenship is running for Senate despite spending a year in jail for conspiring to violate mine safety regulations. A jury found that, under his leadership as CEO of Massey Energy, the company systematically refused to take steps that would have prevented a deadly combination of methane gas and coal dust that left 29 West Virginia miners dead in 2010. The prospect that a candidate with that kind of background could win the nomination to face Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin has prompted national Republicans to target Blankenship in the hope that he doesn’t win the primary. Blankenship’s top rivals for the nomination are U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. In April, a group of GOP strategists aligned with McConnell established the Mountain Families PAC, backed by six-figure television ad buys targeting Blankenship, Politico reported. Blankenship responded by attacking McConnell, including an ad that dubbed him "Cocaine Mitch." (That reportedly refers to a 2014 article in The Nation that said drugs had been found on a ship owned by the family of Elaine Chao, McConnell’s wife and the current Transportation Secretary.) In a May 1 Fox News debate in Morgantown, W.Va., Blankenship continued to attack McConnell and Chao. He brought up the incidents of June 1989, when the Chinese government cracked down militarily on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, resulting in the deaths of between hundreds and perhaps thousands of protesters. "Mitch McConnell was one of the few senators that voted after Tiananmen Square not to have punitive actions against China for human rights violations," Blankenship said. Let’s look at what Congress did in the aftermath. The sanctions bill from 1990 After the Tiananmen Square crackdown, the United States responded with a series of economic sanctions. On Jan. 30, 1990, the Senate followed the House in passing a $9.7 billion spending measure for State Department activities during fiscal years 1990 and 1991. That bill included a suspension of U.S. financial support to China by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade and Development Program. It also stopped the licensing for U.S. exports of military items. The bill passed the Senate, 98-0, and McConnell voted for it. So the most straightforward way to interpret Blankenship’s statement doesn’t hold up. After we reached out to Blankenship’s campaign, they clarified the legislation in question. It was actually a bill from 2000 known as S. 2277. The bill would have authorized the president to extend "normal" trade relations to China, as long as the president certified that China was living up to World Trade Organization standards. This is something quite different than what Blankenship said during the debate. What was S. 2277? Here are some of the problems with Blankenship’s characterization of the bill in question? • The bill didn’t come just after Tiananmen. Blankenship said McConnell voted for the bill "after Tiananmen Square." But S. 2277 was hardly in the immediate aftermath of the killings -- it came 11 years later. • McConnell couldn’t have "voted" for it. Blankenship said McConnell "voted" on the bill, but S. 2277 was an early version of a bill that was later subsumed into a different piece of legislation. So S. 2277 never actually received a floor vote. The Blankenship campaign acknowledged to PolitiFact that it would have been more accurate to say the bill was "sponsored" by McConnell. • McConnell wasn’t one of a "few" GOP supporters. McConnell was indeed a sponsor of S. 2277, along with 10 other Republicans and 14 Democrats. That amounted to one-fifth of the Republican conference at the time -- a significant number of co-sponsors for a Senate bill, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in the U.S. Senate. Moreover, the bill passed out of the Senate Finance Committee with only one dissenting vote in either party. (McConnell was not on the Finance Committee, so he could not have voted on it there.) Once S. 2277 was incorporated into the successor bill -- H.R. 4444 -- that bill received broad support, as well. The bill passed the Senate by an 83-15 margin, with 46 Republicans voting for it and eight opposing it. That’s a Republican conference support rate of 85 percent. • The final version of the bill is more nuanced on human rights than Blankenship suggests. Blankenship has a point that the final bill was designed to end the requirement that the United States renew China’s "normal" trade status on an annual basis. But the bill did seek to maintain some leverage over Chinese human rights policy. Specifically, it established a Congressional-Executive Commission on the People’s Republic of China, charged with monitoring "the acts of the People’s Republic of China which reflect compliance with or violation of human rights." The bill offered a detailed list of human-rights concerned, ranging from freedom of expression and religion to an end to arbitrary arrest and cruel and unusual punishment. The bill also said U.S. funds could be spent for certain purposes in China "if the president has credible evidence" that the recipient "has been materially responsible for the commission of human rights violations." We should also mention Blankenship’s apparent implication that Chao is a reason why McConnell is soft on China. "The key question is what we would expect of McConnell and Chao if they had no Chinese ties," Koger said. "Answer: There is no clear difference. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were a lot of voices calling to end the annual certification of China's trade status. Congress passed a law to that effect, and not because most members of Congress have rich Chinese in-laws." Our ruling Blankenship said, "Mitch McConnell was one of the few senators that voted after Tiananmen Square not to have punitive actions against China for human rights violations." This assertion is inaccurate in multiple ways. McConnell and every other Senate Republican had voted in favor of sanctions in the immediate aftermath of Tiananmen Square; the legislation Blankenship said he was referring to came 11 years later. The 2000 bill arguably weakened but did not eliminate human-rights leverage over China. And the vast majority of Republicans -- not just a "few" -- supported the final version of the measure.

pomt-01597	Says Dan Sullivan approved a "light sentence" for a sex offender who got out of prison and is now charged with a gruesome murder and sexual assault.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/03/mark-begich/sen-begich-wrongly-ties-republican-opponent-horrif/	Sen. Mark Begich, the incumbent Democrat from Alaska, has been forced to pull a television ad that said his Republican opponent’s actions as the state attorney general led to a gruesome murder -- a serious charge based on paper-thin evidence. Begich released an attack ad the Friday before Labor Day that said Dan Sullivan was soft on sex crime during his 18-month tenure as attorney general. Begich and Sullivan are locked in a toss-up race, one of several that could decide which party controls the Senate come November. "(Sullivan) let a lot of sex offenders get off with light sentences," says the ad’s narrator, identified as a retired police officer, standing outside of an Anchorage apartment complex. "One of them got out of prison and is now charged with breaking into that apartment building, murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter. Dan Sullivan should not be a U.S. senator." The ad is talking about a crime allegedly committed by a man named Jerry Andrew Active on May 25, 2013 -- just hours after Active was released from prison. Active should have spent several more years behind bars for a prior sexual assault conviction, according to an Alaska Department of Law investigation, but a clerical error led to a shorter sentence. Active is currently awaiting trial on the May 2013 charges. The ad did not mention Active by name, but it gave a detailed description of the crime -- which received significant coverage in the Alaska media last year -- in front of the building where it occurred. The Sullivan campaign retaliated almost immediately with its own ad (in which they identify Active), defending his record and calling Begich’s ad "shameful." Both campaigns have pulled the videos down at the request of the victims’ family, who claimed the ad was insensitive and could affect upcoming prosecution. (PolitiFact obtained a copy of the ad in order to fact-check it; a TV report in Alaska shows a clip of it.) Even though the ads are no longer on the Alaska airwaves, the skirmish points to serious criminal justice issues. So we decided to dig in and see if Sullivan bears any responsibility for Active’s alleged crime. We found that the timing just doesn’t line up. Doing time Begich’s campaign declined to talk with us about the ad -- citing the pending trial -- so we asked the Alaska Democratic Party for evidence tying Sullivan to events leading to Active’s sentencing and the May 2013 crime. The party pointed out that Sullivan was attorney general in March 2010, when prosecutors negotiated a plea agreement with Active, who at the time was charged with sexual abuse of a minor, among other charges. (Sullivan’s name is stamped on the plea agreement, though it bears the signature of an assistant district attorney.) The Alaska Department of Law later found that Active’s 2010 plea agreement was based on incorrect information and should have come with a longer sentence. If Active had received the longer sentence, he likely would have still been in jail on the day he committed the murders. But Sullivan is not personally responsible for this plea agreement mistake. Let’s take a look at the course of events, according to the Department of Law. Keep in mind that Sullivan was attorney general from June 2009 to December 2010. In January 2009, state troopers arrested Active for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl and then physically assaulting the girl’s mother and brother. In March 2010, Active pled guilty to those charges, accepting a deal with prosecutors that sentenced him to about four years of jail time (including the time he had served up to that point, since his arrest in January 2009). Active was released in 2012. From then on, he was in and out of prison on probation violation charges until May 25, 2013, when he committed the murder referenced in Begich’s ad. When drawing up Active’s plea agreement in 2010, the state looked at his criminal history. As is customary, they received this information from the Alaska Public Safety Information Network. However, Active’s report failed to identify a 2007 felony conviction for providing a minor with alcohol. (That’s typically a misdemeanor, but Active’s charge was treated as a felony due to some nuances in the law.) Because of the inaccurate report, the Department of Law miscalculated Active’s presumptive sentence. They believed it to be between two years and 12 years -- leading to his four-year sentence and release in 2012. If their calculation had included his 2007 felony charge, he would have had a presumptive sentence of eight years to 15 years. The Department of Law said at the time that they are not sure how the mistake happened, though the information network sometimes has blind spots when it comes to offenses that happen in rural villages, like the one where Active was arrested in 2007, according to the Alaska Dispatch. Regardless, this chain of events happened before Sullivan became attorney general. The Alaska Public Safety Information Network pulled Active’s report the day after he was arrested in January 2009 -- Sullivan took office the following June. So although Active’s plea agreement and sentencing happened in 2010, while Sullivan was in office, the mistake that led to Active’s shorter sentence happened more than a year earlier. (At the time, Sullivan was on active duty for the U.S. Marine Corps, according to his campaign.) Additionally, it’s highly unlikely that Sullivan was personally involved with Active’s case and plea agreement at all, said John Skidmore, director of the Department of Law’s criminal division. The state handles about 40,000 cases each year, at least half of which are felonies -- so it’s "unrealistic" for an attorney general to be involved with individual cases, he said. "There is no way that (any attorney general) would be involved in that sort of decision at that level at that time," Skidmore said. Part of a trend? The Alaska Democrats said that under Sullivan, there was a trend of the state giving sex offenders light sentences -- pointing to a dozen cases in which Alaska prosecutors negotiated sentences with sex offenders that fell at the low end of the sentence-length spectrum. They also noted that Alaska local television station CBS 11 produced a story in March 2010 about what happens to criminals who fail to register as sex offenders with the state. The story includes examples of convicted rapists receiving the minimum sentence for failing to register, and others having charges against them dropped. However, Alaska’s sentencing structure encourages prosecutors to negotiate sentencing agreements, leaving judges with little influence over sentencing, said former Alaska Chief Justice Walter Carpeneti in 2012. And these presumptive sentencing policies had been in place since the late 1970s -- so when Sullivan entered the office, these practices were already well-established. During his time as attorney general and subsequent role as commissioner of natural resources, Sullivan was one of the main faces of the "Choose Respect" campaign, started in 2009 by Republican Gov. Sean Parnell to address domestic violence and sexual assault in Alaska. The "Choose Respect" campaign passed several pieces of legislation while Sullivan was attorney general, which his campaign said exemplifies his commitment to the issue. The laws passed include harsher sentences for people involved with child pornography or human trafficking, revision of bail laws for people charged with serious crimes, and specified procedures for DNA retention in murder and sexual assault cases. The campaign also said Sullivan hired the Department of Law’s first cyber-crimes prosecutor whose focus is combating child pornography. Following Active’s arrest for the May 2013 crimes, the state changed its plea bargaining policies, so Alaska prosecutors are no longer permitted to negotiate lower sentences with people charged with violent felonies or sexual crimes. Our ruling Begich said Sullivan approved a "light sentence" to a sex offender who is now charged with "murdering a senior couple and sexually assaulting their two-year-old granddaughter." Active, who is awaiting trial, received a shorter sentence than he was supposed to, but the mistake that led to this sentence happened before Sullivan became attorney general. So to pin the error on Sullivan is wrong, and to suggest that he actively approved the sentence is a fabrication. The ad is not only inaccurate, it makes an inflammatory accusation.

pomt-12474	Easing school lunch regulations "is not reducing the nutritional standards whatsoever."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2017/may/04/sonny-perdue/ag-sec-perdue-changes-school-lunch-rules-says-stan/	Agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue went to an elementary school lunchroom in Virginia to announce new rules for the food schools serve. Under the banner of trimming the childhood obesity rate, combatting rising levels of diabetes and other health problems, Congress passed and the Obama administration implemented new targets for schools. Perdue gave schools more time to comply in two areas -- whole grains and sodium levels -- and expanded the rules for milk. "We're giving these food service professionals the flexibility to move as we get a healthier generation," Perdue said May 1. "This is not reducing nutritional standards whatsoever. It's pausing here to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not." Perdue argued that if kids don’t like what they’re offered, they simply won’t eat it, and giving schools more time to comply would help children get more of the nutrition they need. We focus here on Perdue’s claim that his move does not reduce nutritional standards. Is it true that they do no reduce nutritional standards set by the department in 2012 "whatsoever?" While Perdue is technically correct about not reducing the standards, his department will not be enforcing them. "He is not changing the standards per se, but he is allowing schools to not follow them," said nutrition policy researcher David Pelletier at Cornell University. "It’s a bit like saying the posted speed limits on the roads remain the same, but you can go as fast as you want." The starting point Washington’s school lunch program reaches about 30 million kids every day at a yearly cost of about $11 billion. To qualify for federal support, schools must meet a number of dietary regulations. In 2012, the Agriculture Department announced the final version of Nutrition Standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs. For milk, schools could provide "flavor in fat-free milk only." By 2015, all grain products, such as bread, oatmeal and noodles had to be "whole grain-rich." That term meant that at least half was whole grain and the rest could be processed but enriched with vitamins and minerals. The rule for reducing sodium, or salt, was more complicated and set increasingly lower targets that varied slightly by age group. So for example, by July 2014, a lunch for an elementary student couldn’t contain more than 1,230 mg of sodium, which is about 65 percent of the upper limit for a full day as set in the Federal Dietary Guidelines. By July 2017, the target became 50 percent of the daily limit, and by July 2022, the target went down to about 33 percent. Making 'school meals great again' Perdue’s office sent out a press release entitled "Ag Secretary Perdue Moves to Make School Meals Great Again." It said the department would start the process to allow schools to start serving 1 percent flavored milk. At the elementary school event, Perdue said, "I wouldn't be as big as I am today without chocolate milk." For grains, schools could apply for exemptions to the whole grain-rich content rule through 2020. On sodium, any school meeting the first target for lunches of about 65 percent of the daily limit would be considered in compliance through 2020. In a statement, the department said this was similar to a 2016 memo from the Obama Agriculture Department. That memo said it recognized that manufacturers had lagged in cutting down the salt in food, and so schools "that are working toward compliance" would not suffer if they hadn’t yet made the grade. Perdue’s policy is more lenient, declaring that no school need push beyond the first target while, as Perdue said, the department pauses "to evaluate whether or not the progressive standards of moving even further are appropriate or not." Were nutrition standards reduced? For whole grains and sodium, the new policy extends the timeline for achieving those standards, but so far, the overall goals remain -- with the option to reassess later. Pelletier of Cornell and nutrition policy researcher Joann Slavin at the University of Minnesota both said the underlying nutrition standards are unchanged. But Pelletier called Perdue's statement a "semantic trick." The situation with milk is a little trickier. The 2012 rules, which match the recommendations from a 2009 National Academy of Sciences panel, said flavored milk had to be non-fat. Perdue hasn’t officially changed that yet, but he said "USDA will seek to publish an interim rule as soon as possible to effect the change in milk policy," to allow flavored 1 percent milk. Slavin said the federal rules on milk went too far. That said, they were published as nutritional standards and followed the guidance from an independent research group. Our ruling Perdue said his changes to the school lunch requirements did not reduce nutritional standards. The plain facts and the assessment of experts confirm that the long term goals for whole grains and sodium remain in place for now. However, under the new policy, schools need not make more progress toward those goals for another three years. In addition, the current standards don’t allow flavored 1 percent milk, and the new policy states that the department wants to change that through an interim rule. So the standards might not have changed yet, but Perdue said he plans to do so. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03324	Patrick Murphy voted for Obamacare in 2010, "yet he reversed himself and voted to delay" the employer mandate and the individual mandate.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/jul/25/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-says-patrick-murphy-flip-flop/	Americans for Prosperity, a group opposed to Obamacare, called U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, a hypocrite for his votes on the health care law. The group announced that it had started running online ads nationwide to highlight votes House members took to delay ObamaCare mandates. In Florida, the ads are targeting three South Florida Democrats: Murphy, Lois Frankel and Joe Garcia. (All three members are in their first terms -- Murphy and Garcia are expected to face competitive races in 2014.) A July 23 press release from the group stated: "Rep. Murphy voted for the law back in 2010, yet he reversed himself and voted to delay both the employer mandate (in keeping with President Obama’s decision) and the individual mandate..." and then continued about Garcia’s and Frankel’s votes. The press release portrayed Murphy as a flip-flopper: did he vote for Obamacare in 2010 and then vote to delay the employer and individual mandate? (AFP supports delaying the mandates and repealing the health care law.) The problem with this claim that leapt out at us was that Murphy -- as in Patrick Murphy who represents parts of Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties -- wasn’t a member of Congress in 2010. Murphy beat U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Palm Beach Gardens, in November 2012 and officially took office in January 2013. There was a Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy in 2010 -- but he was from Pennsylvania and lost re-election in 2010. (To make matters more complicated there is a U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa.) We asked an Americans for Prosperity spokesman if it had mixed up Patrick Murphys. "Yes, that’s an error, it was a mix-up with Murphy from PA. We sent out a corrected release a couple minutes later," spokesman Christopher Neefus told PolitiFact Florida in an email July 24. At PolitiFact, we give props to folks who admit to their errors -- and the group did ‘fess up quickly. But we still continue our fact-check. In this case, when we looked at AFP’s newsroom page about Florida on July 24, it still contained the press release with the wrong information about Murphy. The online banner ad doesn’t contain the error -- it simply says "Patrick Murphy voted to delay the ObamaCare mandate. Now let’s end it for good." Murphy’s position on Obamacare On the campaign trail in 2012, Murphy said he supported the health care law, but also thought it could be improved. Specifically, he liked the provisions offering coverage for young people on their parents’ plans, fixing the doughnut hole to get prescription drugs for seniors, and forcing insurers to offer coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions. He criticized some of the requirements on businesses, such as the requirement for filing complicated 1099 forms. That requirement was later repealed. In office, Murphy has continued that general stance of supporting the law overall while calling for "improvements." AFP correctly pointed to separate votes Murphy took for a one-year delay for the employer and individual mandates on July 17. Murphy was one of 35 Democrats to join the Republicans on the employer mandate vote and one of 22 on the individual mandate. (Murphy’s votes help him build the case that he is a moderate. The liberal Daily Kos pointed out that more than half of those 22 Democrats won close races.) The Democratic-leaning Senate is not expected to vote in favor of the delays. In early July, Obama said he would delay enforcement of the employer mandate. The Palm Beach Post quoted Murphy about the mandate votes: "While I believe these delays are important," he said – to give the administration time to work out complexities in the law – "I do not support a wholesale repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which is already providing important protections and security to individuals and families who previously didn’t have access to affordable, quality health insurance." Murphy does not support full repeal of the mandates but does support a one-year delay. Our ruling Americans For Prosperity said in a press release: "Rep. Murphy voted for the law back in 2010, yet he reversed himself and voted to delay both the employer mandate (in keeping with President Obama’s decision) and the individual mandate." The group quickly admitted that Murphy of Florida wasn’t in Congress in 2010, so that part of the claim is wrong. While campaigning in 2012, Murphy said he was generally supportive of the law although he called for some changes. The group is also correct that Murphy voted to delay the employer and individual mandates, but their claim leaves readers with a false impression that his voting record reflects flip flops. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2013-07-25T16:57:48	2013-07-23	['None']
pomt-00622	Says Marco Rubio said that "felons should not have their voting rights restored" but that "convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time."	false	/florida/statements/2015/may/27/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-says-marco-rubio-wants-restore-gun-r/	A Facebook meme suggests that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., believes convicted felons should regain their right to own a gun but not the right to vote. The meme, sent to us by a reader, presents two quotes purportedly by Rubio. The first, dated March 16, is, "No, felons should not have their voting rights restored even after they have served their sentence." The second quote, from May 6, says, "Of course, convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time. It is their constitutional right." The claim was attributed to the Facebook community group "Stop the world, the teabaggers want off." We’ll note right off the bat that the group’s Facebook page cops to being a primarily satirical site. It says, "This page is for entertainment purposes. It is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It is primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages." Still, casual Facebook users are unlikely to see this bit of context and could easily take the quotes in the meme at face value, so we’ll check the substance of the meme anyway. We searched Nexis and Google for the quotes and did not find any instances in which Rubio said those words. (We contacted spokespersons for Rubio and did not get a response. We also tried to contact the "Teabaggers" group via Twitter and Facebook but did not hear back.) Felons and voting rights States have the power to decide how -- or whether -- to restore the rights of felons to vote once they have served their time. (Maine and Vermont allow felons to vote while in prison.) In Florida in 2007 under then-Gov. Charlie Crist, the Cabinet agreed to relax the rules to make it easier for felons to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote. The Cabinet set rules for three levels of offenders who could apply to get their rights back, including the requirement that they had to finish their sentences. At the time, Rubio was the speaker of the House, but since the Cabinet set the rules, the Legislature had no official role. When Rubio ran against Crist for a U.S. Senate seat in 2010, he attacked his record on restoration of voting rights. In 2009, Rubio said on Morning Joe that Crist "restored the rights of felons to vote automatically here in Florida." The following year, Rubio said Crist "worked with ACORN and groups like that to give felons voting rights in Florida." (ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, dissolved in 2010 in the wake of a video sting that showed ACORN employees telling people posing as a pimp and a prostitute how to conceal their criminal activities. The group advocated for increased voter access, but there was no proof that Crist worked with ACORN on his plan to restore voting rights to felons, so we rated that claim False.) In both instances, Rubio clearly sounded like he was criticizing Crist. It’s not a big leap to think that he is personally against allowing felons to regain their right to vote, but his words fall short of making that clear. The issue of restoring voting rights to certain felons has come up in the U.S. Senate the past two years but it hasn’t received a vote, so we don’t know Rubio’s position on it. The Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act of 2015 would allow citizens to vote in any federal election even if they had been convicted of a non-violent criminal offense unless the individual was in jail or on probation. The bipartisan duo of Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate from Kentucky, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, are the measure’s co-sponsors. Last year, Paul co-sponsored a similar bill with U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Florida. Paul, who has made efforts to court black voters, has said that stripping voting rights from felons is a form of voter suppression and has disproportionately harmed black voters. Felons and gun ownership Under federal law, individuals with felony convictions lose their right to own guns, but states can restore these rights, a 2011 New York Times investigation found. In some states, felons can only regain their right to bear arms if they are pardoned, while others allow certain felons to regain their rights after five to 20 years. In Florida, felons are eligible to apply eight years after the completion of their sentence. But we could not find any statements in which Rubio directly talked about whether convicted felons should be able to regain their right to own a gun. Our ruling A Facebook meme says Rubio said that "felons should not have their voting rights restored" but that "convicted felons should be allowed to own guns after they have done their time." The meme was posted by a site that describes itself as satirical, and we found no evidence that Rubio actually said the words attributed to him. While Rubio has spoken critically in the past about felons regaining voting rights, he does not appear to have taken a stance on the restoration of felons’ gun rights. Rubio didn’t say these words, so we rate the claim False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2015-05-27T10:26:20	2015-05-13	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-04875	President Obama and Nancy Pelosi said "Obamacare" would save money because "they factored in 10 years worth of tax revenue and only six and half years worth of expenses."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/08/eric-hovde/gop-candidate-us-senate-hovde-claims-obamacare-lev/	The U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the federal health care reform law didn’t slow down efforts by Republicans to block the measure -- or at least heap criticism on it while campaigning. In a July 29, 2012 interview on WISN-TV with host Mike Gousha, U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde joined the chorus of critics and said the law would "help bankrupt the country." Hovde said he disagreed with assessments from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that repeal of the bill would add to the federal deficit. "Let's go back and show how Nancy Pelosi and President Obama said that over the next decade, ‘Obamacare’ will save us money," said Hovde, who is running against three other Republicans in the Aug. 14, 2012 primary. "What they did is they factored in 10 years worth of tax revenue and only six and half years worth of expenses. " Those numbers sound familiar. Indeed, the "10 years and six" claim has been a common refrain by Republicans and has been looked at a number of times by our PolitiFact partners. When we asked Hovde’s campaign for backup, they referred us to several articles that make the same point about the health care law: "Congressional Democrats delayed these provisions in order to show only six years of spending under the plan in the original 10-year budget window (from FY2010-19) used by CBO at the time the law was enacted," said a July 11, 2012 statement from Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee, as reported in the conservative Weekly Standard. Basically, the supporting evidence simply re-states the claim. So we took our own look. The health care law took effect in 2010, and taxes began then to support the measure. Key parts of the bill don’t kick in until 2014. In an item about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, PolitiFact National noted that the 10-year aspect of the claim was correct. The item read, in part:: "The CBO said this about the health care law back in 2010: It lowers the deficit, by about $124 billion over 10 years. And in 2011, when Republicans offered a bill to repeal the health care law, the CBO said that increased the deficit, by about $210 billion over 10 years." That estimate was updated in July 2012, when the CBO said the law would cost $84 billion less than it had previously predicted. On Jan. 6, 2011, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virg., made virtually the same claim as Hovde, saying the law "offset 6 years of benefits with 10 years of tax increases" and it was Half True. PolitiFact Virginia noted: "Cantor’s argument that the ‘benefits’ don’t kick in until 2014 is true if you’re looking at the biggest provisions of the law. But many other, smaller provisions to boost coverage have already taken effect." Those include small business tax credits, coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, assistance for early retirees and coverage for dependents until they’re age 26. Also, not all of the taxes kicked in immediately. On March 1, 2011, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli said the law has "six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue." PolitiFact Virginia also rated Cuccinelli’s claim Half True. "The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost," it wrote. "But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014." So, yes, the taxing began in 2010, and key parts of it don’t kick in until 2014. But, like so many claims, it’s not as simple as that. Some benefits already kicked in, and some of the taxes don’t take effect until later. Our rating Hovde repeats a claim that’s been a routine part of the GOP attack on Obamacare: that there are 10 years of taxes charged for six years of benefits. It’s true that the tax money began to come in starting in 2010. But it’s false that the benefits don’t kick in until 2014. There are numerous parts of the bill that have already taken effect. Hovde joins the crowd who have made the same claim. It’s Half True.	None	Eric Hovde	None	None	None	2012-08-08T18:30:53	2012-07-29	['Nancy_Pelosi', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-10523	"I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/07/barack-obama/20-years-is-an-accurate-count/	In a race where his opponent Sen. Hillary Clinton has touted "35 years of experience" over and over, Sen. Barack Obama has begun to cite his own experience of 20 years. At a debate in Cleveland, moderator Brian Williams asked Obama to respond to Clinton's charges that he was heavy on oratory and light on action. Obama responded: "You know, she characterizes it typically as speeches, not solutions, or talk versus action. And as I said in the last debate, I've spent 20 years devoted to working on behalf of families who are having a tough time and they're seeking out the American dream. That's how I started my career in public service." The voters will decide if the lesser number is significant, but we find Obama's claim of two decades' experience to be accurate. To arrive at this number, we looked closely at Obama's official congressional biography, his professional resume and news articles chronicling his political rise in Illinois. If Obama wins election and takes office in January 2009, he will have served four years in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois. Before that, he was a state senator in Illinois for eight years. He also was a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school during that time. His schedule from the school shows him teaching two or three classes in the fall and winter terms — usually Constitutional Law III: Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process; Voting Rights and the Democratic Process; and Current Issues in Racism and the Law. In the spring, he would attend the Illinois legislative sessions. It seems a fairly safe bet that, like most legislators, his constituent work — fielding phone calls and helping people in his district — went on year round. Press reports indicate he did a small amount of private law practice during the summer. So that's eight years as a public official in Illinois, bringing our total to 12 years. To get to 20 years of experience, we still need eight years from Obama's career prior to holding public office. Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983. He worked for a year as a financial analyst; in his memoir he said he spent his days behind a computer terminal, "checking the Reuters machine that blinked bright emerald messages across the globe" and feeling like "a spy behind enemy lines." He gave up that job to go into community organizing, work he felt was more important politically. He worked three years as a community organizer in Chicago before going to Harvard Law School. We won't count the junior-level business experience as working "on behalf of families who are having a hard time," but the community organizing work does seem to fit the bill. That brings his work experience to 15 years. At Harvard, Obama began to receive national attention. He became the first black president of the Harvard Law Review and was recruited heavily by law firms around the country. (He met his future wife, Michelle Robinson, as a summer associate at the Chicago firm Sidley Austin.) He graduated in 1991. He ran Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive, for much of 1992, and then accepted a position with the Chicago firm Miner, Barnhill & Galland. The firm specialized in political and civil rights work and neighborhood economic development work. He also began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1993. He was elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1996 and took office in 1997, so his full-time work after law school comprises five years. That gets us to 20 years. (During these years, Obama also worked on his career as an author. His memoir Dreams from my Father was published in 1994 and reprinted after his speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. A follow-up, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream , was published in 2006. His personal financial disclosure statements show that those books earned him $1.8-million in 2005 and 2006, the majority of his income.) The other part of Obama's claim is that his experience is "on behalf of families who are having a tough time and are seeking out the American dream." We take that to mean his experience is broadly in the field of public service, and that too is an accurate claim. The bulk of Obama's professional experience is either in elected office or working for a nonprofit, a university or a civil rights law firm. Obama's 20 years of experience are 15 years short of Clinton's, but it's worth noting that Obama is 14 years younger than Clinton. Voters will decide whether the gap between 35 years and 20 years of experience is significant, but we find Obama's statement about his own experience to be True.

pomt-06004	"The top 10 most well-paid CEOs in America received a combined $770 million in 2010, while the average American worker’s wage rose just 2 percent."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/19/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-says-combined-top-ceo-pay-topped-7/	Rep. Dennis Kucinich often decries the pay gap between America’s top earners and the growing poverty class. He recently took to the stump after the U.S. Census Bureau released a new report on poverty, using it as a chance to promote safety net programs and his National Emergency Defense Act, which calls for investing in infrastructure and folding the Federal Reserve into the U.S. Treasury. "The top 10 most well-paid CEOs in America received a combined $770 million in 2010, while the average American worker’s wage rose just 2 percent," he said in a news release. PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued. To think, these 10 CEOs are so gifted that they command compensation — in a single year — that is the rough equivalent of the gross domestic product of Grenada. Put another way, if they pooled their annual pay for 2010 it would have exceeded: What Tiger Woods reportedly paid his ex-wife ($750 million) in their 2010 divorce settlement. What China Shipping Container Lines recently paid ($754.4 million) for eight new container ships to be delivered in 2013. Heck, the CEOs’ collective booty totaled nearly one one-thousandth of the economic stimulus called for in President Obama’s $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. So PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. Kucinich based his claim about the 10 highest paid CEOs on a survey produced annually by a group called GMI, which tracks corporate governance. We looked at a summary of the report and found it to be on the level. The total for the combined compensation of the 10 highest paid CEOs on its list was $770,046,373. Just to be clear, we note that the compensation these CEOs received was not all in the form of salary. Much of it came in the form of exercised stock options, deferred compensation and other benefits. But to that, we say, so what? It is still compensation. According to the survey, the highest paid CEO on the list is John Hammergren of health care giant McKesson Corp. of San Francisco. He exercised $112 million in stock options while getting a boost of $13.5 million in retirement benefits. His salary was but a measly $1.6 million. And if he gets bounced from the company, he won’t be left wanting. If that were to happen, he stands to collect $469 million in severance pay. The pay package didn’t sit well with GMI. "Shareholders understand and expect that extraordinary compensation must be linked sufficiently to extraordinary performance," said GMI’s chief communications officer Paul Hodgson in a written statement. "For that reason, they are increasingly frustrated about these clear failures of compensation governance." GMI also pointed out that in 2010, the total realized compensation for CEOs in the Standard & Poor’s 500 rose by a median of 36.5 percent. "The 36.5 percent increase in realized compensation is particularly notable when it’s put in context of the modest growth of the economy in 2010 and general public company performance last year," Hodgson stated. Kucinich’s staff provided a table from the Census Bureau to support the part of his claim about wage growth for average American workers. It states that total compensation for civilian workers rose 2 percent in 2010. If just wages and salaries are included, the percentage drops to 1.6 percent. So, on this point, Kucinich’s statement is pretty close. We note, though, that his statement used the word "wage" to describe the 2 percent increase. The 2 percent figure from the Census Bureau includes total compensation. But the real figure -- 1.6 percent -- would only strengthen his point. Politifact Ohio is not trying to stoke the fire of class warfare by pointing out how much certain CEOs made in a year compared with the average worker. We’ll let Kucinich take the hit for that. But as to his claim about the vast difference between the haves and the have-nots, he is pretty much on target. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kucinich’s claim True.

pomt-06739	Rick Perry "has advocated abandoning Social Security, scuttling Medicaid and ending the federal income tax."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/aug/28/margaret-carlson/columnist-margaret-carlson-says-perry-has-advocate/	In an opinion column published Aug. 9, 2011, Margaret Carlson of Bloomberg News says Gov. Rick Perry has said some "far-out things." Among examples: Perry "has advocated abandoning Social Security, scuttling Medicaid and ending the federal income tax." Talk about shaking up the USA. Is this right? We did not hear back from Carlson on the basis of her claim. But we had an idea of where to start our check. "Fed Up!," Perry’s 2010 book urging Americans to resist Washington’s drift, includes his critiques of Social Security, Medicaid and the federal income tax. For instance, Perry writes that Social Security is "something we’ve been forced to accept for more than 70 years now" and calls it a "crumbling monument to the failure" of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. He likens the program, which provides benefits to senior citizens and the disabled, to a Ponzi scheme — a claim we rated False in November 2010, noting that Social Security is accountable to Congress and the American people while a Ponzi scheme is a criminal enterprise. He also highlights the decision by three Southeast Texas counties in the early 1980s to leave Social Security for a private retirement savings program. In December 2010, we rated Mostly True his claim that employees in the counties fared well as a result. In a Nov. 4, 2010, interview on CNN's Parker Spitzer, Perry said an option for the country going forward would be to let states decide whether to stay in Social Security or take a different approach to retirement savings. Part of the exchange between host Eliot Spitzer and Perry: Spitzer: "So, you want to let people opt out (of Social Security)?" Perry: "I think, let the states decide if that’s what’s best for their cities." Spitzer: "So the states will let people opt out of Social Security." Perry: "They should, I think it’s a discussion…" Spitzer: "I haven’t seen anybody propose that before because that’s going to be …" Perry: "Well, we just laid that on the table so let’s talk about it." Spitzer: "OK, so that’s your plan?" Perry: "That’s not my plan, Eliot." Spitzer: "But, governor, I’m trying to get you, look, you’ve written a book …" Perry: "I know, you’re trying to get me in a corner and I don’t corner very good. What I’m trying to do is have a discussion with the people of this country on an issue …" So, Perry has advocated a discussion of letting states opt out of Social Security. In his book, Perry doesn’t call for scuttling Medicaid, a state-federal partnership providing health insurance to low-income Americans, though he writes that the 2010 Democratic-passed health care overhaul "only makes matters worse for the existing broken systems of Medicare, Medicaid and" the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which insures children of the working poor. Perry adds: "The primary problem with Medicaid right now is that there are too many beneficiaries and not enough doctors or funding," a situation he says will worsen under the health care overhaul because more residents will be eligible for Medicaid. Perry sounded another anti-Medicaid note in a November 2010 interview with Greta Van Susteren of the Fox News Network, telling her: "I'd like to see the states be given the opportunity to opt out of the Medicaid program that we are looking at today." An Austin American-Statesman news story at the time said that in interviews, Perry had referred to a December 2009 Heritage Foundation memo stating Texas could save $60 billion between 2013 and 2019 by dropping out of Medicaid—even though the federal government was picking up 60 percent of the Texas costs. That memo says: "On a state-by-state basis, every state except North Dakota would come out ahead financially by leaving Medicaid but continuing long-term care (nursing home) spending with state-only dollars." In a Dec. 3, 2010, press release from his state office, Perry calls for changes to Medicaid. "The current Medicaid system is financially unsustainable for states and the federal government, as costs increase about 9 percent per year in Texas alone," Perry said. "Without greater flexibility and the elimination of federal strings, Medicaid will strangle state budgets and taxpayers as Obamacare and other programs expand Medicaid rolls." Perry continues: "Texas, the states and the federal government would be much better served by increasing flexibility and innovation in Medicaid, even block granting funds to the states, so we can tailor Medicaid dollars to best serve the needs of Texas patients, families and taxpayers." The same month, Perry said a Texas request for a waiver enabling the state to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool helping some low-income Texans get private insurance "has languished in a file cabinet at the (federal) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for more than two years." We rated his statement Pants on Fire after noting we’d earlier determined the federal government was waiting for Texas to submit a revised proposal. Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, told us this month the Texas waiver request was ultimately shelved by the state in the wake of the 2010 congressional overhaul of health care laws, though this year the commission submitted a limited proposal seeking a waiver to change how some Medicaid payments are made to hospitals. She said the request isn’t intended to curtail any Medicaid services. In his book, Perry lists changes to taxation among steps "we must take to wrest the reins of the federal government from those who have let it run wild for far too long." Toward restricting "the unlimited source of revenue that the federal government has used to grow beyond its constitutionally prescribed powers," Perry writes: "One option would be to totally scrap the current tax code in favor of a flat tax," simplifying taxation and making it harder to manipulate. Another option, he continues, "would be to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment," which enabled the income tax, and then pursue an alternative model of taxation such as a national sales tax. Asked to comment, gubernatorial spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email that Carlson didn’t reflect Perry’s views. "Social Security and Medicaid programs are unsustainable in their current form," Frazier said, "and Gov. Perry believes they must be substantially reformed." Frazier said Perry "has never advocated ending the federal income tax, but has" called it misguided. Her email continues: "The 16th Amendment sadly gave far too much taxing power to Washington, and helped usher in a massive expansion of government and a tax code too complicated and onerous to easily comply with. The way the federal government taxes Americans must be reformed." Our judgment: Perry would at least study giving states leeway not to continue Social Security. If study led to such an option, and if states went along, this would effectively amount to abandonment. As far as we can tell, though, Perry has not said Social Security should now be abandoned. Perry has said he wishes states could opt out of Medicaid. If that option were offered and if states agreed, the program would effectively be scuttled. But Perry also has said he favors Medicaid reforms. Finally, he says taxation could be improved by replacing the federal income tax. While this would end the income tax, Carlson’s statement misleads by failing to note that Perry would replace some income-tax revenue with money from a new tax. We rate Carlson’s statement Half True.

pomt-00867	"(Jeb) Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/13/american-bridge-21st-century/liberal-pac-says-jeb-bush-edited-his-own-emails/	While all the attention is on Hillary Clinton’s email records, one left-leaning political action committee wants to remind everyone about a correspondence flap from another potential presidential candidate -- former Gov. Jeb Bush. American Bridge 21st Century posted on its website a reaction to a March 2 tweet Bush sent out about Clinton’s use of a private email account while she was Secretary of State. The PAC pointed out that Bush also had used a private account as governor, and had repeatedly defended his own editing of what emails would become part of the Florida public record. "Media accounts establish that Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose – apparently nothing would have stopped the Bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails," the American Bridge website read. Does Florida’s open records law allow Bush (and all other of the state’s elected officials) to hand-select what emails they make available to the public? Sure enough, it does, but there’s more to it than just letting politicians self-report emails. Mail call Bush famously used the personal email address Jeb@jeb.org for all eight years of his two terms, from 1999 to 2007. He cultivated an open and tech-savvy image by announcing in December 2014 he would post more than 250,000 emails from his time as governor, ahead of a possible 2016 presidential run. In February 2015, jebbushemails.com went live with a quarter-million emails and the first chapter of an e-book Bush was writing about being governor. But there are a few things about the release that sometimes get overlooked. First, those emails were selected from messages already available from the state archives as of December, so the disclosure wasn’t entirely new. Bloomberg reported Bush didn’t submit all of his email until earlier in 2014 -- more than seven years after he left office. The Sunshine Law states an official must turn in records "at the expiration of his or her term of office." Documentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush’s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007, most recently in June 2014. The last batch is described as "Additional 2002-2003 emails." Next, and this gets to the heart of what American Bridge said, is that the messages sent to the archives and subsequently posted on Bush’s website are only a portion of all his correspondence during his term. Bush in 2007 said that he had received 550,000 emails through the Jeb@jeb.org address -- plus another 2.5 million through his public email address -- so obviously plenty were not included in the batch of about 250,000 that the Bush team posted in February. As American Bridge said, Bush decided what would go to the archives and what wouldn’t. The PAC told us that’s comparable to Hillary Clinton’s situation and is therefore hypocritical. (We’ll leave it to readers to decide what’s hypocritical and what’s not.) Bush’s camp told PolitiFact Florida that he had more than satisfied state reporting requirements. "Governor Bush complied with Florida’s broad public records laws for more than 15 years, beyond what was even required by the law," Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell. "His emails related to state business have been available via requests to the state for that entire period of time." The emails Bush turned over to the state are only the ones he self-selected as pertaining to state business. He left out messages concerning politics, family matters and fundraising -- although there are several emails from donors posted on the site. Bush acknowledged he kept his emails on a private server. But while American Bridge tried to draw a parallel between Bush’s self-selection and Clinton’s current dilemma, we found nothing to suggest Bush’s editing had violated Florida’s Sunshine Law. State statute allows officials or an authorized custodian to determine which emails go into the public record based on whether they pertain to state business. The state archives only receive and preserve them. Another big difference is that while Clinton was not open about her private email use, Bush was transparent about the fact that he was using a private account, according to First Amendment Foundation president Barbara Petersen. "There’s nothing in the public records law about personal accounts," Petersen said about rules in Florida. "Some agencies have policies discouraging the use of personal accounts, but that was after Bush left office." If there is any question that emails had been left out of Bush’s disclosure, a person or group could make a public records request and file a civil suit if they think something’s missing, she said. State law does allow private inspections of electronic devices if warranted to find missing texts and emails. But no one has made that challenge of Bush, Petersen said. Overall, the emails provide Bush with a talking point leading up to 2016, said Bill Allison, senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation. He’s done what Florida law requires and exerted pressure on his presumptive Republican rivals. "Once you create the expectation to become transparent about something, people will expect that," Allison said. "I’m not sure this will catch on the same way as health records and tax returns, but it could make it very difficult for candidates who do not comply." Our ruling American Bridge said "Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose." Bush did self-edit which emails were posted on a website he established in February, but the PAC doesn’t note one important point: State law allows him to do that. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05166	Says Mitt Romney has said "we don't need 'more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.' "	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jun/18/tennessee-democratic-party/tennessee-democrats-accuse-romney-saying-more-cops/	The debate over economic policy is beginning to dominate the presidential campaign, and when presumed Republican nominee Mitt Romney visited suburban Nashville for a June 12 fundraiser, the Tennessee Democratic Party pounced on a statement it called "shocking." The TNDP sent a flurry of similarly worded press releases and one read: "Rep. Mike Turner, a career firefighter, and Principal Roxie Ross, a lifelong educator, held a press conference call at 2 p.m. responding to Mitt Romney’s claim that we don’t need ‘more firemen, more policemen, more teachers’ ahead of a Romney fundraiser in Williamson County." Of course, Republicans often criticize "big government" and sometimes portray government workers as overpaid, but it’s rare to see any politician single out a specific set of workers -- particularly firefighters and police officers. Noting that the TNDP isolated a phrase in quotes, we wondered if Romney’s words might have been taken out of context. TNDP communications director Brandon Puttbrese responded to our inquiry with links to news articles about Romney’s comments, made just after Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker won the recall election. Here is the full Romney quote from which the TNDP lifted the remarks. Romney is referring to President Obama’s call for more spending to boost the public sector: "He wants another stimulus, he wants to hire more government workers. He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people." We note that Romney did not say there should be "fewer" policemen, firemen and teachers, but the full context of the quote makes clear he disagreed with Obama’s stated policy goal of having Congress appropriate more stimulus money to add more of them. The more accurate characterization of Romney’s remarks would have been that "Romney disagrees with President Obama’s goal of adding ‘more firemen, more policemen, more teachers,’ " though we recognize that doesn’t have the same zing as the TNDP’s wording. Romney’s quote came at the same event in Iowa in which he criticized Obama for saying that "the private sector is doing fine." Obama's private sector comment was part of a longer discussion in which he argued the massive public sector job losses have been a drag on an economy that has otherwise steadily added private sector jobs. Romney has pushed back, suggesting that it is an overweight public sector that is shackling the private sector. One point worth noting here is that Walker has responded to the Obama-Romney tete a tete by defending his own record when it comes to firemen, policemen and teachers. He said recently: "I know in my state our reforms allowed us to protect firefighters, police officers and teachers. That's not what I think of when I think of big government." Our check of other Romney comments found that he has typically been critical of government workers in general without specifying workers such as cops and firefighters: "That stimulus he [President Obama] put in place — it didn’t help private sector jobs, it helped preserve government jobs. And the one place we should have shut back — or cut back — was on government jobs." Our ruling The Tennessee Democratic Party says Mitt Romney has said "we don't need 'more firemen, more policemen, more teachers.' " That's a slight exaggeration of Romney's remarks -- he was responding to Obama's comments on them, not outlining his own specific policy against them. Still, that's pretty close to what Romney said. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Tennessee Democratic Party	None	None	None	2012-06-18T05:00:00	2012-06-12	['None']
pomt-04162	Northern Virginia is the most "heavily trafficked place in the country."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/dec/20/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-northern-virginia-has-ther-nations-/	Northern Virginia is No. 1 in the nation when it comes to traffic jams, according to Gov. Bob McDonnell. "Here we are with the most heavily trafficked place in the country in northern Virginia and Hampton Roads not far behind," McDonnell said during a Dec. 6 news conference while promoting a plan to seek $500 million in transportation funding from the General Assembly. Anyone who’s endured rush hour in Northern Virginia can relate. But is it really the most congested place in the country? Jeff Caldwell, a spokesman McDonnell, told us the governor’s claim is based on a 2011 study by the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University, an often-cited gauge of traffic congestion in the U.S. The research found that drivers in the Washington area -- which includes parts of northern Virginia and Maryland as well as the nation’s capital -- spent an average of 74 hours in traffic jams during 2010, the most in the country. Chicago, where commuters spent an average 71 hours on snarled roads, ranked second. Los Angeles was No. 3, where the delay per commuter was 64 hours. McDonnell’s off-the-cuff language was a bit inexact. He said Northern Virginia was the worst, but it was the Washington region overall that earned that distinction in the Texas institute’s report. We learned that McDonnell was more precise while delivering a prepared speech at a statewide transportation conference on Dec. 5, saying that TTI "ranked the Washington, D.C./Northern Virginia metropolitan area as the most congested area in terms of commuter delay in the U.S..." The Washington region has been ranked first or second in the yearly delay per commuter in each annual TTI report going back to 1999. Hampton Roads, meanwhile, was listed as having the 26th highest delay per commuter at 34 hours in 2010. The Richmond region, with 20 hours of delay each year per commuter, ranked 64th out of the 101 urban areas examined. The report also found the Washington area had the second highest traffic time index -- which is the ratio of how much extra time a commuter drives in peak travel conditions as opposed to "free flow" conditions. By that score only Los Angeles, had a worse rating. TTI plans to update its traffic report in early 2013. TTI’s findings have been widely cited by the Federal Highway Administration and the media. Philip Shucet, a former Virginia transportation commissioner, told us the TTI report is "the industry standard" for measuring traffic. Other organizations studying traffic have come to different conclusions than TTI. INRIX, a traffic analysis company based in Seattle, this past May released its report on the worst cities for traffic in 2011. Honolulu topped the list; INRIX found drivers there wasted 58 hours last year in traffic. Also ranking in the top five were Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Bridgeport, Conn. The Washington area, where drivers spent 45 hours in traffic jams, ranked sixth. We wondered why the two studies -- TTI examining 2010 traffic patterns and INRIX looking at 2011 conditions -- came up with different results. David Schrank, co-author of the TTI report, said his institute uses a narrower definition of metropolitan areas than INRIX. Shrank said the TTI study, cited by McDonnell, focuses on densely developed areas in and near to the urban core of a region. INRIX, he said, includes less populated areas on the fringes of urban regions. Schrank also said INRIX study measures traffic by vehicle speed, while TTI took both traffic speed and traffic volume into account. We made three attempts by phone and email to reach a spokesman for INRIX, but received no response. INRIX keeps an updated scorecard on its website listing the cities with the most traffic congestion in U.S. As of this writing, it showed Los Angeles at No. 1 and Washington at No. 9. GPS maker Tom Tom releases its own gridlock report every three months based on information from drivers using its devices. Of all U.S. and Canadian cities it surveyed from April to June, in 2012 Los Angeles congestion was rated the worst. Among U.S. cities, Washington was tied with Seattle for third place. Tom Tom bases its rankings on a measure of how much added travel time is caused by congestion in each area it examines. Our ruling McDonnell, during a news conference, said Northern Virginia is the most "heavily trafficked" area in the country. His wording would have been more precise if he had said Northern Virginia is part of the most congested area in the country that also includes Washington and populous Maryland suburbs, according to a 2011 TTI report. McDonnell did make that distinction in a prepared speech he gave one day earlier at transportation conference. While traffic is bad around Washington, not all experts agree it’s the worst in the nation. We found reports by other transportation organizations that ranked the region sixth and third. But we don’t fault the governor for relying on the TTI study -- the industry standard for measuring traffic. So we rate McDonnell’s comments True.

pomt-07197	"I did not say that I would not have them [Muslims] in my Cabinet."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/08/herman-cain/cain-denies-claims-he-said-he-would-not-appoint-mu/	Former pizza CEO and talk show host Herman Cain loves to say he’s not politically correct. Now, his brash words have pushed him to correct the political record. On "The Glenn Beck Program" radio show May 24, the Republican presidential hopeful tried to rebut accusations that in March he said he would not appoint Muslims to Cabinet positions or federal judgeships in a potential Cain administration. "I did not say that I would not have them in my Cabinet. Because if you look at my career, I have hired good people regardless of race, religion, sex, gender or orientation and this sort of thing," Cain told Beck. This statement, made just three days after Cain’s May 21 announcement that he is running for president, was only his latest attempt to put the controversy to rest. Reporters have dogged him on the issue for two months. "People are trying to push me in a corner," he groused in April to The Daily Caller, a news website founded by conservatives. No one puts Herman Cain in a corner. But fact-check him? We can’t resist. What did he say in March about appointing Muslims to his Cabinet? We called and emailed the Cain campaign for comment. It did not respond, so we proceeded without it. Metro Atlantans are accustomed to Cain as an agitator. He’s been goading liberals for years as a conservative talk show host on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB. Cain’s comments about Muslims barely made news locally, but with the growth of his support, he faces more scrutiny than ever before. Now we’re learning whether what plays with metro Atlanta conservatives works on the national stage. The controversy began in February in a Milner church. Cain talked about his bout with stage four liver and colon cancer and suggested he was uncomfortable when he learned his surgeon’s name was "Abdallah." The evangelical publication Christianity Today asked Cain about his comment in a March 21 article. Cain replied that Muslims should stop trying to convert others. "And based upon the little knowledge that I have of the Muslim religion, you know, they have an objective to convert all infidels or kill them," Cain said. Five days later, a blogger for liberal ThinkProgress.org questioned him at the Conservative Principles Conference in Des Moines, Iowa. "Would you be comfortable appointing a Muslim either in your Cabinet or as a federal judge?" the blogger asked. "No, I will not," Cain replied. "And here’s why. There is this creeping attempt, there’s this attempt to gradually ease Sharia law and the Muslim faith into our government. It does not belong in our government." By that Monday, Cain was explaining his comments to national media outlets. He’s been at it ever since. This brings us back to Beck’s radio show, where Cain said his statement was "misconstrued." "[The reporter] said, would you be comfortable with a Muslim in your Cabinet?" Cain told Beck. "And I immediately said, without thinking, ‘No, I would not be comfortable.’ I did not say that I would not have them in my Cabinet. Because if you look at my career, I have hired good people regardless of race, religion, sex, gender or orientation and this sort of thing. " Indeed, the question the ThinkProgress.org blogger asked Cain was whether he would be "comfortable" with a Muslim in his Cabinet, not whether he would appoint one. If you take the video on its face, the explanation Cain gave on Beck’s show seems reasonable. The problem is that it contradicts what Cain said about his own comments. The Monday after the news broke, Cain recounted what he said on Fox News’ "Your World with Neil Cavuto." "A reporter asked me ‘Would I appoint a Muslim to my administration?’ I did say ‘no,’ " Cain told Cavuto. "And here’s why ... I would have to have people totally committed to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. And many of the Muslims, they’re not totally dedicated to this country," he said. In April, Cain repeated he would not hire a Muslim to radio host Bryan Fischer, who is also a conservative. We found an excerpt from the show on a website critical of the political right: "[T]he comment I made that became controversial, and my staff keeps hoping will die, is that I wouldn’t have Muslims in my administration. And it’s real simple. The Constitution does not have room for Sharia law ... and to introduce that element as part of an administration when we’ve got all of these other issues, I think I have the right to say that I won’t," Cain said. Cain’s opposition to Muslims in his Cabinet is not ironclad. After some prodding, he told Cavuto he might consider a Muslim who’s loyal to the Constitution but never met one he would choose for his Cabinet. Still, contrary to his claim on Beck’s program, Cain did say he would not have Muslims in his Cabinet. Not once or twice, but three times in as many weeks to ThinkProgress.org, Cavuto and Fischer. When scrutiny grew stronger, Cain backtracked. During Beck’s program, he parted ways with the truth. The heat is on, and Cain’s Pants are on Fire.

pomt-09289	U.S. Rep. Bill Young "has accepted $737,000 from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/26/charlie-justice/bill-young-earmark-campaign-contributions/	U.S. Rep. Bill Young, R-Indian Shores, has never been bashful about directing federal money back to his constituents in the Tampa Bay area. But now those hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks are being criticized by his opponent's campaign. Democratic state Sen. Charlie Justice of St. Petersburg levied a series of allegations against the 20-term congressman in a two-minute web video airing on Justice's website. Among them is a claim that Young, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee who served as its chairman for six years, has received more than $700,000 in campaign contributions from people, businesses and groups who received his earmarks. "Just this year, Bill Young put earmarks on the federal budget totaling $128 million," the ad says. "Young has accepted $737,000 from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks." (We should note that the "this year" reference is to FY 2010, not 2010 the calendar year. Republicans, including Young, have said they won't pursue earmarks in the FY 2011 budget). The ad, which began running April 14, 2010, has been criticized by the Young campaign, in part because it attempts to link Young to disgraced ex-lobbyist Jack Abramoff, even though Young says the two never met. As a longtime member of Congress and a high-ranking member of the appropriations committee, it's not surprising that Young would receive campaign contributions from the people and companies he's supported, especially those located in his district. But the number in Justice's ad caught our attention since Young has been easily re-elected every year he's run. (He's only received less than 60 percent of the vote once, in 1992.) Justice's campaign said the $737,000 figure includes campaign contributions going back to 1997. That translates to about $61,000 a year. Justice campaign manager Mitch Kates provided PolitiFact Florida with a 37-page document that purports to show the link between the contributors to his campaign and how Young helped their companies secure federal earmarks. The document says that it tracks earmarks -- federal projects that lawmakers designate for particular companies or other entities -- from budget years 2008, 2009 and 2010, and contributions since 1997. The math The Justice campaign traced earmarks sought by Young to the company or group that would receive the money. The campaign then searched the Federal Election Commission database and OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan campaign finance website, to see who from that company or group donated to Young. Justice's campaign also used OpenSecrets to match lobbyists to the company getting the earmark. The overall dollar figure in Justice's ad includes lobbyist contributions as well, and goes back to 1998. We checked their methodology by running a search for a company called DRS Technologies, a Largo company that Justice says has received more than $12 million in earmarks since 2008. We found their approach sound. But in the process of doing that, we found that the Justice campaign's numbers didn't add up. We extracted all the contributions from the document and found more than $1 million in contributions -- not $737,000. Kates said the published figure was conservative. That seems strange because of the specificity of $737,000. But then, as we kept looking, we saw that there was more wrong with the numbers. The Justice campaign counted the same bundles of contributions five times or more, which vastly inflated the figures we found. The multiple countings occurred most often in dealing with lobbyists, who often represented multiple clients that dealt with Young. One Washington lobbying firm Van Scoyoc Associates, for instance, had identical contributions counted at least five times by Justice, because the company represented multiple clients. Also counted multiples times were contributions by the PMA Group, a defunct Washington lobbying firm that was under investigation for funneling bogus campaign contributions to then-U.S. Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa. We created our own database that includes only unique contributions that Justice identified as coming from the beneficiaries of earmarks. The total? Closer to $600,000. Then Kates hastily provided PolitiFact Florida a second document showing another $1 million in contributions that he said was the result of additional research. But we found almost all of those contributions were duplicates as well. But, when you add both documents, the total is $795,000. So while the Justice approach was sloppy and full of double-counting mistakes, the number happened to be about right. Connections to earmarks Now we need to know if Young helped those companies get earmarks. We started by asking the Justice campaign how it tied Young to a specific earmark. Until 2008, earmarks in Congress were almost always requested anonymously. So Justice's campaign aides looked at earmark requests only from budget years 2008, 2009 and 2010, they said. They searched the Office of Management and Budget archives for Rep. Young’s earmarks from fiscal year 2008 and the Congressional Record for earmark declarations from fiscal years 2009 and 2010 (Those declarations are actually on Young's Congressional website). "Each procured earmark from FY 2008 or 2009 was verified in the bill’s explanatory statement, and FY 2010 earmarks were verified in committee reports wherever possible," Kates wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact Florida. "We then cross-referenced the parties involved with his contributors in the Federal Election Commission database, searching specifically for each organization’s board of trustees and any executive leadership committees. Any contributions from the parties' lobbyists, as identified through the Open Secrets database, were also included." Young's earmark requests generally split into one of two categories -- either local projects in the Tampa Bay area, or defense projects for companies that have offices in Young's district. A few examples: In 2009, Young requested $4 million for researcher SRI International to continue a port security project in conjunction with the University of South Florida. SRI International announced plans to build a facility at the Port of St. Petersburg in 2006. Also in 2009, Young requested $6 million for Honeywell in 2009 to develop new ballistic missile technology (they have a location in Clearwater). For the 2010 budget year, Young requested $14 million for Pinellas County for beach erosion control, $250,000 for a business assistance project, $300,000 for a county substance abuse treatment program, and $250,000 for homeless medical care, among other requests. Young requested $4.8 million in 2009 and 2010 for St. Petersburg College for its National Terrorism Preparedness Institute, and $831,000 for terminal improvements at St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport. Young spokesman Harry Glenn questioned a few of the earmarks Justice had tied to Young, specifically money for defense contractor Northrop Grumman. But he agreed Young had requested most of the money -- mainly for companies doing business in the Tampa Bay area. Glenn rattled off a list -- DRS Technologies of Largo, General Dynamics of St. Petersburg, Lockheed Martin of Oldsmar, Science Applications International Corp. of St. Petersburg, Information Manufacturing Corporation of Clearwater, L-3 Communications of Tampa, General Electric of Clearwater, Alliant Techsystems of Clearwater, Honeywell of Clearwater, Marine Desalination Systems of St. Petersburg. "These are all constituent companies doing work and employing people in Congressman Young's district," Glenn said. So Justice seems to be on relatively firm ground that the companies and other entities have received earmarks. But he makes a big leap of logic in tying individual contributors to those companies. Who's a recipient First, it is not technically accurate to say "recipients of his earmarks" gave Young that money. The recipients of his earmarks were mostly corporations, but they are prohibited under federal law from making campaign contributions. Justice bases his claim on the fact that many individuals who contributed to Young's campaign are employed by those companies. But Justice has not proven that those many individuals directly received money from the Young earmarks. Indeed, in our cursory examination of the names, we see examples of people who may not work directly in projects that got the earmarks. Paul Sacco, the director of Pinellas County's real estate management department, donated $250 to Young's campaign in 2008, but we didn't find an earmark that would seem to relate to real estate. St. Petersburg College administrator Janice Buchanan donated $250 to Young in 2006 while working with the college's foundation. Thomas Miles, an engineer with Science Applications International Corp., donated $1,250 to Young in 2006 and 2008, but Miles isn't listed as an executive with the company. Justice's list also includes contributions from Pinellas County elected officials: $1,000 from County Commissioner Karen Seel and $250 from former County Commissioner Ronnie Duncan. Justice also makes a big leap in trying to tie the lobbyists to the companies and other entities that received the earmarks. For example, DRS Technologies, of Largo, spent $2.86 million with 13 different lobbying firms in 2009, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Under Justice's calculations, a contribution from any employee of any one of those 13 firms would be linked to Young. But that can be misleading because companies hire lobbyists for specific projects. Some firms might have contact with Young and his office. Many won't. Glenn said several don't lobby Young on those earmarks, including the lobbying firm PMA Group. "PMA does work in Congress for DRS, but they never have come to our office to discuss an issue," Glenn said. "We never had any contact with them on this company." Our ruling Back to Justice's claim. In a web ad, he claims that U.S. Rep. Bill Young "has accepted $737,000 from lobbyists and recipients of his earmarks," and offers two documents totaling more than 80 pages to back up his claim. We checked the research and, quite frankly, find it a little squirrely. We know that Justice can only track earmarks back to 2008 because prior to that they were largely inserted anonymously, but he includes campaign contributions dating back to 1998. That's not a true apples to apples comparison. And the numbers don't add up. We don't know where Justice got the $737,000 from -- originally we tallied more than $1 million in contributions (though a lot of that was double counted). Then, Justice's campaign provided us with a second document with another $1 million in contributions (and again, a lot of that was double counted). Granted, the number still totals nearly $800,000 when you add both documents together and only count unique contributions. But Justice's claim is shaky because he is relying on two leaps of logic -- that any contributor who happens to be employed by a company is a "recipient" and that any lobbyist with a firm that did work for a recipient is tied to the earmark. Both create holes in his claim. We find it Half True.	None	Charlie Justice	None	None	None	2010-04-26T15:51:57	2010-04-14	['United_States']
pomt-15261	"Our last budget committed the highest level of need-based financial aid in state history."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/31/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-his-last-budget-committed-more-n/	In what read like an introduction to a campaign platform, Gov. Scott Walker outlined a series of potential presidential talking points in a June 8, 2015 op-ed published in the Quad-City Times, an Iowa newspaper. Among them: A line about making higher education more affordable for low-income families. "Our last budget committed the highest level of need-based financial aid in state history," Walker wrote. Is he right on that point? Looking at the budget When Walker made the claim, the 2015-’17 budget was still being debated in Madison, so that means his "last budget" would refer to the one for 2013-’15. In Wisconsin, budgets are done in two-year cycles, with each of the fiscal years beginning July 1 and ending June 30. Funding for most programs is broken out on an annual basis, so the two years in a biennial budget will often receive different amounts. Complicating matters: the actual numbers for how much the state spent in a fiscal year are typically not final until the following October. Asked to back up his statement, Walker's office pointed to data from the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau that show the last budget spent $121,034,960 for need-based financial aid for 2013-’14. That is a larger number than any previous year, but it does not account for inflation. When earlier years are placed on the same inflationary scale, the data shows $370,000 more was spent on need-based financial aid in Fiscal Year 2011. That was part of the budget was passed in 2009, when Democrat Jim Doyle was still in office. But there is a second year in that "last" budget Walker referred to. Since the final numbers are not out yet, we don’t know exactly what was spent in 2014-’15, but we do know that budget set aside $121,263,400 for the program. That would be the most of any budget. When you combine the 2013-’14 actual amounts with the appropriated amounts for 2014-’15, the figures come out to about $8 million more for need-based financial aid than Doyle’s 2009-’2011 budget -- even when the numbers are adjusted for inflation. But there is a bit more to the story. Wisconsin Covenant In 2011-’12, the first year of Walker’s first state budget, funding for need-based financial aid decreased. Since then, the amount has increased every year. And some of the increased cost is due to a obligations from a program created under Doyle -- the Wisconsin Covenant -- that Walker discontinued. The Wisconsin Covenant program allowed an 8th grader to sign a pledge that he or she would maintain a B-average and graduate from high school. If the student did that -- and met several other requirements, including submitting a financial aid application -- he or she would get a scholarship of a varying amount. Students were first able to sign the covenant in 2007, when Doyle was still governor. In 2011, the first group of students were able to collect on that covenant, soon after Walker took office. When Walker cancelled the program, those who already signed the pledge were to receive scholarship money if they remained eligible, but no new applicants could enter the program after September 2011. The Wisconsin Covenant accounted for nearly $8 million of the need-based financial aid total in 2013-’14. Meanwhile, it was expected to account for more than $10 million in 2014-’15. If the money to support the program were subtracted from Walker’s budget, Doyle’s budget would have given more to need-based financial aid than Walker’s. Our rating Walker said: "Our last budget committed the highest level of need-based financial aid in state history." That is accurate, even when sliced different ways. But it is the worth noting that the spending levels are boosted significantly by spending required from a program created by Doyle -- the Wisconsin Covenant -- that Walker ended. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-07-31T09:00:00	2015-06-08	['None']
pomt-07335	Under President Barack Obama, the United States has "doubled our exports."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-doubled-exports-during-hi/	During a May 10, 2011, speech at a Democratic National Committee event in Austin, Texas, President Barack Obama offered a litany of accomplishments to a friendly audience. "We passed equal pay for equal work legislation," Obama said. "We made the largest investment in education in our history, but didn’t just put more money in, initiating unprecedented reforms that are having ramifications all across the country. We made the largest investment in clean energy in our history and have created entire new industries, like the advanced battery manufacturing industry here in the United States of America, where we look like we'll have close to a 40-percent share of the market in the next few years. Doubled our exports. Ended a war, as promised, and are working another war in a place where we're going to start drawing down our troops this year and are in a position to help Afghans secure their own country." The claim that immediately caught our eye was that during Obama’s presidency, the United States has "doubled our exports." So we decided to take a look. We turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which produces monthly statistical tables on trade. One table offers data that begins in January 2009 -- when Obama was inaugurated -- and ends in March 2011. It shows imports and exports on a monthly, annual and year-to-date basis, all of them seasonally adjusted. Here are a few ways to slice and dice the numbers. Most recent month compared to January 2009: In January 2009, exports of goods and services were $125.5 billion. For March 2011, that number was $172.7 billion -- a 38 percent increase. Most recent month compared to the equivalent month in 2009: In March 2009, exports totaled $126 billion. For March 2011, that number was $172.7 billion -- a 37 percent increase. First quarter of 2011 compared to first quarter of 2009: In the first quarter of 2009, exports were $378.4 billion. For the first quarter of 2011, exports were $505.2 billion -- a 34 percent increase. Extrapolated amount for all of 2011 compared to the actual amount from all of 2009: For all of 2009, exports totaled $1.571 trillion. Multiplying the first-quarter 2011 results by four produces a full-year projection of $2.021 trillion for 2011 -- a 29 percent increase. All told, then, the data show an increase in exports of about one-third from the baseline Obama inherited -- not double. This isn’t the first time Obama has spoken of doubling exports. In his 2011 State of the Union address, he said, "To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -– because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home. Already, our exports are up." But Bryan Riley, a senior trade policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation, noted that the president hasn’t met the goal yet. "Exports are up but have not doubled," Riley said. When we presented the data to the White House, a spokesman did not dispute our numbers. "The president is committed to doubling our exports within five years and we have already made substantial progress toward that goal," said White House spokesman Adam Abrams. So Obama was getting ahead of the facts when he said that the United States has doubled its exports. That’s the goal, and progress toward it is being made. The doubling hasn’t happened yet. So we rate his statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-05-11T16:10:42	2011-05-10	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-15200	Says "if the (Iran nuclear) deal gets rejected, they still get" $150 billion.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-iran-gets-keep-150-billion-even-if-us/	Whether Congress approves it or not, Iran will still reap all the financial benefits of the nuclear deal, Donald Trump said on NBC’s Meet the Press Aug. 16. When asked by host Chuck Todd how he would work with the Iran deal if he becomes president, Trump, running for the Republican nomination, said he would be "tough" on the contract, but it would be hard given all the money Iran would already have acquired as a result of the deal. "The problem is by the time I got in there, they will have already received the $150 billion," Trump said. "Do you know if the deal gets rejected they still get the money? Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn't believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich." Does Iran actually get $150 billion from this deal? And if Congress rejects the deal, does Iran still get the money? Let’s take one question at a time. The $150 billion It’s true that Iran will reap significant economic benefits from the deal because many sanctions levied against Iran will be lifted as long as Iran complies with restrictions on its nuclear program. But it’s not like Iran will automatically receive a check or, as some critics have called it, a signing bonus. "Will some considerable portion get transferred to Iran? Sure. But not all of it will automatically. That’s not how this works," said Michael Malloy, a law professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law and an expert on economic sanctions. First, the money already belongs to Iran; Iran just hasn’t been able to access it. The $150 billion figure, primarily thrown around by critics, typically refers to the dollar amounts of Iran’s foreign assets that could be unfrozen when sanctions are lifted. An example is money Iran has earned from selling oil but is held by a foreign bank. There’s also the many billions of dollars Iran has lost in revenues and opportunity costs because the country has not been able to fully participate in the global marketplace, Malloy said. But $150 billion is on the high end of estimates of the value of Iran’s foreign assets, which start as low as $25 billion, said Garbis Iradian, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. Most experts we interviewed, including Iradian, peg the amount of unfrozen assets at about $100 billion, but no one is 100 percent sure of the amount. You can probably get to $150 billion if you count up every possible type of money that sanctions have made difficult for Iran to access and use, said Richard Nephew, an expert on economic sanctions at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. Iran has financial obligations other than the sanctions, so even if all the sanctions are lifted, they won’t suddenly have all of these assets at their disposal. For example, Iran owes billions to China for infrastructure projects. Lower estimates take into account restrictions on the money other than the sanctions, Nephew said. So even if the total assets are $150 billion, it’s unlikely that that much will actually be available to Iran when sanctions are lifted. The Obama administration has said that after Iran pays its outstanding financial obligations, it will have about $56 billion at its disposal. What if Congress rejects the deal? While the exact amount of Iran’s unlocked sanctions is less precise than Trump describes, experts told us that Trump’s broader point is largely correct: Even if Congress does not approve lifting the United States’ sanctions, Iran will likely be able to get a good chunk of the money it currently cannot access. This is because other countries and international bodies, including the European Union and the United Nations, could decide to stop enforcing their own sanctions against Iran anyway. Iradian estimated that Iran would be able to access $40 billion of its currently inaccessible assets in that scenario, and the Iranian economy could get an even bigger boost if European companies decided to invest heavily in Iran. The United Nations, for one, has already passed a resolution to provide Iran with the funds withheld under the sanctions if Iran meets its end of the bargain, noted George Perkovich, an expert on nuclear strategy and vice president of studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Of course, Iran wouldn’t be able to access all of its assets in this scenario because much of them are tied up in the United States’ sanctions. "There would be some crumbling of the sanctions wall, but that does not on its own free up the entire $100 billion," Malloy said, adding that the United States controls much of the petroleum market, which is important to Iran’s economy. At the end of the day, the discussion entails a lot of speculation, but nearly every expert said there’s a reasonable likelihood that other countries would choose to stop enforcing sanctions no matter what the United States decides to do. It’s worth noting that it will be difficult for Congress to maintain the sanctions because there would have to be enough votes to survive a presidential veto. Our ruling Trump said of Iran that "if the (nuclear) deal gets rejected, they still get" $150 billion. Experts told us that even if Congress rejected the nuclear deal -- thus maintaining current U.S. sanctions -- other countries could stop enforcing their own sanctions anyway. As a result, Iran would be able to access at least some of its assets that have been frozen under international sanctions. However, experts said it’s highly unlikely that this would amount to $150 billion, the maximum estimate of how much Iran could benefit by the lifting of all international sanctions without regard to Iran’s outstanding financial obligations. Without United States participation, the best estimate we could find was $40 billion. Trump’s claim is partially accurate but cherry-picks the high end of estimates for the unfrozen assets. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-08-16T18:26:33	2015-08-16	['Iran']
pomt-11814	Says a Washington Post reporter is "calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore" for up to $7,000.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/15/anonymous-caller/no-washington-post-did-not-offer-7000-roy-moore-di/	A person purporting to be a Washington Post reporter left a voicemail on an Alabama phone number offering up to $7,000 to women willing to malign Republican senate nominee Roy Moore. The Nov. 14 message was received by Pastor Al Moore of Creola, Ala., who played the recording for local CBS affiliate WKRG. The news outlet described the message as a "robocall" and said "at least one person in our viewing area" received the message. (They did not respond when we asked how many people had received the call.) "Hi, this is Bernie Bernstein, I’m a reporter for the Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5,000 and $7,000 dollars," the message stated. The caller then said the newspaper "will not be fully investigating these claims" but would make a written report, and said he could be contacted via email at albernstein@washingtonpost.com. This voicemail smelled fishy to us — so we decided to investigate further. It turns out the call was a hoax that appears calculated to undermine the work of real journalists. Voicemail comes on heels of Washington Post report The suspicious voicemail comes as top Republicans call for Moore to end his bid in the Dec. 12 special election after the Washington Post reported that Moore, while in his 30s, had sexual encounters with several teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl, according to the women. Since then, another accuser has alleged that Moore assaulted her in locked car when she was 16. Moore’s attorney, Trenton Garmon, seized on the phone call during a Nov. 15 appearance on MSNBC and floated the possibility of pursuing legal action. "Robocalls are now even being made asking for people to come forward against Roy, which I think is kind of an indication of the political climate that we're in, and we plan on even probably getting into some depositions related to that," said Garmon, who acknowledged that he did not know who was responsible for making the call. Washington Post's denial It’s unclear what relationship, if any, the voicemail bears to the Nov. 9 Washington Post report concerning Moore’s alleged sexual encounters. But for his part, Moore forcefully denied the allegations and threatened to sue the Post after their bombshell investigation led top Republicans to call for Moore’s exit. "The Washington Post published another attack on my character and reputation because they are desperate to stop my political campaign," he said at a Nov. 12 campaign speech in Huntsville, Ala. "These attacks said I was with a minor child and are false and untrue -- and for which they will be sued." The Moore campaign did not respond to our request to comment on this story. Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron dismissed the voicemail as an effort to "discredit real journalism," saying the reporting methods described in the call bear "no relationship to reality." "The Post has just learned that at least one person in Alabama has received a call from someone falsely claiming to be from The Washington Post," Baron said in a written statement. "The call’s description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality. We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism." The Washington Post further noted in a Nov. 15 article that no Post newsroom employees are named "Bernie Bernstein" or "Al Bernstein." Additionally, Moore, the pastor who received the voicemail, told WKRG that his attempt to email the address provided in the message came back undeliverable. (The same was true of our efforts.) Our ruling A caller purporting to be a Washington Post reporter named Bernie Bernstein left a voicemail saying the newspaper was offering women up to $7,000 for damaging information on Roy Moore. The Washington Post denied having made the call and dismissed it as an effort to discredit journalism. Further, it said the reporting methods described in the call — offering cash in exchange for muck — runs counter to Post practice. We found no record of any Washington Post reporters or editors named Bernie Bernstein or Al Bernstein, and emails sent to the address provided in the message came back undeliverable.

pomt-07636	"Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. I think there are 104 in the United States, two of them around the coast in California."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/16/bill-kristol/bill-kristol-says-20-percent-us-electricity-comes-/	The extensive damage to Japanese nuclear facilities following the massive earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, has focused more attention on nuclear power than it has received in years. On the March 13, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, about how the situation in Japan could affect the use of nuclear power in the United States. "Bill, at a time when Democrats and Republicans were finally getting together and supporting nuclear power as safe, clean, non-polluting energy, and President Obama had $36 billion in loan credits in his 2012 budget to promote more plants, what happens now to the domestic industry?" Wallace asked. Kristol responded, "Well, we can probably save $36 billion from the 2012 budget because I think it's a bit of a setback to nuclear power here in the U.S. I'll go out on a limb and make that prediction. "But, you know, people will say, well, we build new plants. Twenty percent of our electricity currently comes from nuclear power plants. I think there are 104 in the United States, two of them around the coast in California. Very earthquake-resistant, but I guess there could be a tsunami there. It sounds like it's the tsunami that did the most damage in Japan. "So, on the one hand, it's impressive how resistant these things are to damage. On the other hand, I do think, as you say, these alarming fears, whether or not they -- certainly if they come to fruition, and let's hope they don't -- it's obviously a setback to nuclear power. And I think it makes even stronger the case for going after natural gas and oil domestically." We wondered whether Kristol’s statistics on electricity generation and the number of nuclear plants were correct -- and we figured our readers would be too. So we looked into it. We first turned to the Statistical Abstract of the United States, a compendium of statistics published by the U.S. Census Bureau. It includes a table summarizing electricity generation by fuel type through 2009. Dividing net electric generation via nuclear power by net generation in the electric power sector as a whole, we get 20.9 percent. That’s close enough to Kristol’s comment to pass muster with us. Next, we turned to the website of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency has a page where you can find active nuclear generating facilities on a map and in alphabetical order. We counted them up, and there are exactly 104 sites listed. Kristol’s only error was in suggesting that there are 104 nuclear power plants; in fact, there are 104 nuclear power reactors. Because many plants have more than one reactor, the actual number of plants is 65. (This list doesn’t count military and scientific reactors, which are not overseen by the agency.) Finally, we checked Kristol's claim about nuclear facilities on the California coast. There are, in fact, two: Diablo Canyon, located 12 miles from San Luis Obispo, and San Onofre, located 46 miles from Long Beach. The photographs on the agency's website clearly show that the plants are located near the water. So Kristol was basically correct, only erring with his mislabeling of "reactors" as "plants."

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. The story claims that Willis called Trump the "best U.S. president ever" and that anyone who doesn’t like him should move to Canada. The story revisits an interview Willis did with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon in 2015. But it doesn't make the story more credible. Willis joked with Fallon suggesting that his natural hair looked a lot like Trump’s, poking fun at the idea. Photos then circulated of Willis wearing the signature "Make America Great Again" hat on the show, leading to a stream of stories claiming Willis was a Trump supporter. The image even caught the attention of Trump, who tweeted that Willis was wearing his hat on the Tonight Show. In reality, Fallon never asked if Willis supported Trump, and Willis never expressed support for Trump as a candidate. The Global Headlines article also says Willis is conservative. Willis has shown mixed political leanings. In 2007, he told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly that he has just as many liberal ideas as he does conservative.

"Breaking: Muslim New Jersey Mayor just banned the word ‘Christmas.’" stated a Dec. 16 headline on the Last Line of Defense, a fake news website that identifies itself as satire. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no such ban on the word ‘Christmas’ by Mayor-elect Ravi Bhalla. Bhalla, a city council member and lawyer, was elected mayor Nov. 7 out of a field of six candidates. He will be officially sworn in Jan. 1, 2018. The previous mayor, Dawn Zimmer, decided not to run again. Bhalla will be the first Sikh mayor of Hoboken. During the election, a flier with the phrase "Don't let TERRORISM take over our town" above a picture of Bhalla appeared on car windshields. The Last Line of Defense article stated that Bhalla received a Christmas gift from Zimmer: a chance to make one mayoral decree at the annual Christmas gala at the Patrick C. Farley Community Center at 5th and Brussels. The two politicians shook hands and then "Bhalla shocked the roughly 200 citizens in attendance with his decree that "the word ‘Christmas shall not be said at government functions,'" the article stated. Apparently that didn’t sit well with one man in the audience, according to the website which used a quote allegedly from the Hoboken Journal. "The crowd began to boo loudly and one man was escorted out after throwing a souffle at Bhalla’s head, knocking his turban off. Eventually, things returned to normal but there was a sense of displeasure the rest of the evening." We searched the website of the Hoboken Journal, a blog, and found no such quote. The Last Line of Defense article then stated that the "war on Christmas has gone on long enough." "If Mr. Bhalla doesn’t like it he can go back to his home country of IDontGiveAFuckistan and leave Americans to be Americans," stated the article. Hoboken spokesman Juan Melli said that the only truthful part of the article is that Bhalla will become the mayor in January. The photo accompanying the article is of Bhalla and Zimmer in front of City Hall. "Everything else is garbage," Melli told PolitiFact. "I don’t know how else to put it." There was no Christmas gala (there was a Christmas tree lighting that was indeed open to the public). Also there is no intersection of 5th and Brussels in Hoboken. And Bhalla isn’t Muslim -- he is a Sikh. Bhalla, a child of Indian immigrants, was born in New Jersey. Melli said that he sent the fake news article to Bhalla and that the mayor-elect laughed. A headline stated that a "Muslim New Jersey Mayor just banned the word ‘Christmas.’" Bhalla, the mayor-elect of Hoboken, didn’t ban the word ‘Christmas’ and he is not Muslim.

pomt-01589	ISIS is "right now crucifying Christians in Iraq, literally nailing Christians to trees."	false	/texas/statements/2014/sep/05/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-isis-crucifying-christians-iraq-nail/	We were unaware of a horrible turn against Christians in Iraq until U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz brought it up. The Texas Republican, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, recently told a reporter for WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, that the Islamic State group, in the news for numerous acts including killings of two U.S. journalists, is "right now crucifying Christians in Iraq, literally nailing Christians to trees." Crucifixions as in killing someone by nailing or tying his or her hands and feet to a cross or, as Cruz said, a tree? Cruz, news stories offer no evidence We emailed Cruz’s office about how he knew of the crucifixions and received no evidence in reply. Our own research did not uncover news stories confirming the crucifixion of a Christian in Iraq or elsewhere while U.S. advocates and experts on the bloody conflicts in Iraq and Syria expressed unfamiliarity with such actions. But Christians, along with people of other faiths, have been in the crossfire of the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. On Aug. 8, 2014, a CNN news story said Iraq's largest Christian town had been overrun by ISIS, causing thousands of Christians in the city to flee, just as other minority groups targeted by ISIS had done, as well as Shiite Muslims, the story said. CNN said the French government confirmed the Iraqi city of Qaraqosh had fallen into the hands of ISIS. The story said ISIS earlier took over Mosul, another city in Iraq, prompting many residents to flee to Qaraqosh. In Mosul, CNN said, ISIS issued an ultimatum to Christians living there: Convert to Islam, pay a fine or face "death by the sword." CNN’s story noted the Pope saying on Twitter Aug. 8, 2014: "I ask all men and women of goodwill to join me in praying for Iraqi Christians and all vulnerable populations." A few weeks later, CNN described young boys being trained by ISIS at a camp in Syria and, according to a participant identified only as Mohammed, witnessing a crucifixion. According to the Aug. 29, 2014, news story, some boys were forced to watch hideous things. "They used to bring young (kids) to the camp to lash them," Mohammed said. "When we go to the mosque, they order us to come the next day at a specific time and place to [watch] heads cut off, lashings or stonings." "We saw a young man who did not fast for Ramadan, so they crucified him for three days, and we saw a woman being stoned (to death) because she committed adultery," Mohammed said. Experts: Crucifixions possible, not observed yet Close observers of the turmoil in Iraq and Syria said they could imagine ISIS doing crucifixions. No one expressed awareness of Christians already being crucified. By email, Daniel Sullivan of a Washington, D.C.-based group, United to End Genocide, noted the CNN story before telling us he hadn’t seen "confirmed reports in either Iraq or Syria" of Christians being crucified. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said Cruz’s claim went overboard, as far as he knew, though he said ISIS has been ruthless about hurting or killing resistant residents. "There have been people put on crosses," Landis said. "But it’s not Christians." Landis guided us to an April 29, 2014, Fox News story accompanied by photographs of men slung on crosses in Raqqa, a town in northern Syria. The story cited a Syrian opposition group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, saying ISIS jihadists were hanging the bodies of executed enemies on crosses crucifixion-style in the town. The story, citing "multiple reports," said ISIS had ruled over Raqqa for the previous year, killing its remaining rebel population and demolishing national relics. The news story said Ibrahim Alrquaoui of the opposition group said the killed men were rebels that had previously fought against the Syrian government of Bashir al-Assad. The story said that according to Alrquaoui, the ISIS charged the seven men with espionage and attempted assassination of the group’s leaders. According to the story, Alrquaoui said he witnessed the executions himself and took photographs, which were then posted on the group’s Facebook page and circulated on the Internet. The photographs showed different men bound to crosses in what appeared to be a public square area, though the Fox News story said it could not be independently confirmed the subjects were dead or, if they were, by what means the executions had been carried out. "The pictures do not show any apparent signs of the men nailed to a cross, nor are there any obvious, visible signs of fatal wounds," the story said. Landis also pointed out a Feb. 26, 2014, online post by Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, an Oxford University student, describing a traditional practice in Islam for a Jew or Christian living under the authority of an Islamic state agreeing to pay a jizya, or poll tax, in return for protection from the state. The Feb. 26, 2014, post, on Landis’ website devoted to Syrian politics, history and religion, said the tax is equivalent to Mafia racketeering; a failure to pay leads to the loss of protection. ISIS similarly imposes the tax, the post said, in northern Iraq and Syria. By telephone, Jeffrey White, a defense fellow at The Washington Institute specializing in the military and security affairs of the Levant and Iran, told us he monitors videos from Iraq and Syria and is familiar with the ISIS practice in Syria of hanging a body from a post after a killing. (That’s not a crucifixion as that act is commonly defined.) But, White said, he hasn’t seen videos of anyone nailed to a tree -- in Iraq or elsewhere. Cruz’s claim "doesn’t accord with what I’ve seen," White said. Our ruling Cruz said ISIS is "right now crucifying Christians in Iraq, literally nailing Christians to trees."

pomt-13611	Says his father-in-law, former Gov. Linwood Holton, "integrated Virginia public schools."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-over-credits-his-father-law-linwood-holt/	Tim Kaine has a special place on his heroes list for his father-in-law, former Virginia Gov. Linwood Holton. "Linwood Holton, who turns 93 next month, was the Republican governor of Virginia from 1970 to 1974 who made the decision to desegregate Virginia schools," Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said during an Aug. 4 speech to the National Urban League. Kaine told the civil rights group that before Holton, Virginia governors had played "all kinds of tricks" to avoid complying with the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 that struck down public school segregation. "But Lin decided we want to be an aristocracy of merit; everybody’s equal," Kaine said. "He integrated Virginia schools." He gave the same credit to Holton during a speech in Miami on July 23, when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton introduced Kaine as her running mate. Kaine also said Holton "integrated Virginia’s public schools" during his July 27 speech at the Democratic National Convention, when he accepted the vice presidential nomination. Was Holton really the force that broke Virginia’s history of school segregation? The answer, two historians and a political scientist told us, technically is "no" but symbolically "yes." "It is inaccurate to say Linwood Holton integrated Virginia public schools," said Robert Pratt, a University of Georgia historian who grew up in Virginia and in 1992 wrote a book about the desegregation of Richmond schools. "All of the desegregation that came about in Virginia came as a consequence of federal court action." Benjamin Campbell, author of "Richmond’s Unhealed History," agreed. "The integration of schools in Virginia was court-ordered," he said. But Holton’s public and personal reactions to the court orders, they added, set a tone of acceptance in Virginia for a new era of integration. A brief history Let’s start with the Brown v. Board of Education decision. At that time, Virginia’s government had been dominated for 28 years by a segregationist Democratic machine led by U.S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd Sr. Rather than integrate public schools, Byrd led a movement to close them and set up publicly funded tuition grants to help white students attend private academies. The result was that some black students, most notably in Prince Edward County, were left with no schools to attend. Virginia lawmakers also created a three-person pupil placement board tasked with assigning all students in the state to schools. Black students seeking to transfer to white schools rarely received permission from the panel. Congress put pressure on Virginia and other Southern states by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Among other things, it allowed Washington to withhold education funds to states that refused to integrate public schools. Massive Resistance and the pupil placement board gave way in the mid-1960s to a new ploy. Localities adopted "freedom-of-choice" plans that gave all students the right to select their schools, regardless of race. But this didn’t spur integration. Black and white parents were concerned about sending their children to schools where they would be minorities, Campbell said. In addition, the plans typically did not provide transportation for students who wanted to go to schools outside their neighborhoods. In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the freedom-of-choice plan in New Kent County wasn’t meeting the mandate of establishing "a unitary non-racial system of public education." It ordered federal district courts to devise school plans for New Kent and other freedom-of-choice localities in which "racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch." The combination of the 1968 high court ruling and the increasingly real threat of losing federal funds spurred many school systems toward serious integration. Richmond, however, dragged its feet. Enter Holton Holton’s election in 1969 was historic. It marked the first time since the Reconstruction days of 100 years earlier that Virginia elected a Republican governor. It also ended a 44-year era in which the Byrd Machine held the state’s top office. During his inaugural address in January 1970, Holton said "old dogmas have died" and called for a new era of integration. "Here in Virginia, we must see that no citizen of the commonwealth is excluded from participation in both the blessings and the responsibilities of our society because of race," he said. "We will have a government based on a partnership of all Virginians, a government in which there will be neither partisanship nor prejudice of any kind. As Virginia has been a model for so much else in America, let us now endeavor to make today’s Virginia a model for race relations." Holton’s calls for cooperation touched a special nerve in Richmond, where black parents filed suit to integrate the city’s schools. In March 1970, U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. ordered Richmond to draft a new integration plan. On Aug. 17 - just two weeks before schools opened - Merhige approved a plan for the busing of 13,000 students. In addition to Richmond, Roanoke, Lynchburg and Norfolk were under court-ordered busing plans for the new school year, sparking white flight in all of those cities. Amid the controversy, Holton and his wife, Jinks, had to make a choice. The Executive Mansion, while located in Richmond, is state property. So the Holtons could send their three children to any public school in Virginia. They chose to enroll them in the predominantly black schools that were closest to the mansion. On Aug. 31, 1970, Holton escorted his oldest daughter - 13-year-old Tayloe - into John F. Kennedy High School. The moment was memorialized by a photo that ran the next day in newspapers across the country, including just under the masthead of The New York Times. Kaine’s future wife, Anne, and her younger brother, Woody, were taken to Mosby Middle School on the first day by their mother. Experts who told us the courts integrated Virginia schools still heap praise on Holton. "Of course, the courts ordered everything," Campbell said. "But this was the first political leader in Virginia to advocate for integration. From the point of view of those of us living in the state, it was absolutely amazing. It was unheard of." "I have the utmost regard for Linwood Holton," Pratt said. "What he did played a very important symbolic role." Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said, "We had a history of governors and other officials ignoring orders on desegregation or tying them down on appeals. (Holton) obeyed the busing order, and that did result in integration." Sabato said Holton’s political career suffered from his stand. The state "Republican Party wouldn’t have anything to do with him after that," he said. In 1978, Holton sought the party’s nomination for the U.S. Senate and finished last among three candidates at the state GOP convention. We should note that Merhige also suffered consequences after ordering busing. The judge received death threats and sent his children out of the country. His dog was shot, and a guest house on his property was burned down. Our ruling Kaine often says that Holton, his father-in-law, "integrated Virginia public schools." He offers no qualifications and creates an inaccurate impression that Holton, as governor, ordered the opening of all state school doors to all students. The technical credit belongs to the courts, which outlawed segregated schools in 1954 and for years afterward closed loopholes fashioned by politicians in Virginia and other Southern states. Those efforts were stymied in Virginia in 1970 by court-ordered busing. Holton’s symbolic efforts, however, can’t be dismissed. Unlike Virginia governors before him, he embraced integration. Unlike his predecessors, he didn’t contest court orders. And in a small but significant way, it can be said that he helped to integrate Virginia schools by enrolling his three children in predominantly black schools. So on the whole, we rate Kaine’s statement Half True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-08-15T02:00:00	2016-08-04	['Virginia']
pomt-08452	Says state Rep. Patrick Rose votes 90 percent with liberals, backed the state's largest tax increase, proposed nearly $15 billion in government spending and supported "Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/15/jason-isaac/jason-isaac-says-state-rep-patrick-rose-votes-libe/	Playing on his foe's name, Republican Texas House nominee Jason Isaac calls fourth-term Democratic Rep. Patrick Rose a "liberal thorn in our side." In a video ad that debuted online Oct. 7, Isaac lists pointed reasons to yank Rose, who's in his fourth term. Rose, the narrator says, "votes with the liberals 90 percent of the time, ...backed the largest tax increase in Texas history... (and) proposed nearly $15 billion in new government spending." The narrator adds: "Rose even supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas." The Truth-O-Meter analyzed the biggest-tax-increase charge earlier this year when U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison laid it on Gov. Rick Perry. We rated False Hutchison's statement that the state's revamped business tax amounted to the largest tax increase Texas has ever had. In checking Hutchison's statement, we noted that her campaign said the revised franchise tax, often called the margins tax, cost taxpayers $8.8 billion in 2008-09. Her camp compared that figure with the estimated $5.7 billion tax package signed into law in 1987 by Gov. Bill Clements. At the time, that increase was widely reported to be the largest tax hike in Texas history. There were fatal flaws in Hutchison's math. For instance, the $8.8 billion figure is the total amount generated by the franchise tax, not the net increase resulting from the revision that became law under Perry. The actual increase — revenue above what the old franchise tax would have brought in — was about $3 billion, significantly less than what had been projected. We compared that with the largest single piece of the Clements-era tax package: a hike in the sales tax. After it was enacted, sales tax revenues went up $4.2 billion during 1988-89 compared with the previous biennium. Isaac's campaign consultant, Corbin Casteel, cited the same 2006 tax law, House Bill 3, as the basis for Isaac's "largest ever" claim. Casteel also referred us to the same source referenced by Hutchison, a Dallas Morning News blog post that doesn't that doesn't specify how the paper compared 2006 changes in business and tobacco taxes to past tax hikes. Meantime, two experts we contacted--Dale Craymer of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and Talmadge Heflin of the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation--independently told us the 2006 tax changes did not amount to Texas history's largest increase. But what of Isaac's other not-rosy claims? Casteel said the reference to Rose voting with "the liberals" 90 percent of the time was backed up by an analysis of House votes by Mark P. Jones, who chairs Rice University's political science department. Casteel guided us to a Texas Tribune chart based on Jones' work showing that Rose is the 68th most liberal of the House's 150 members and the 7th-most conservative Democrat. We didn't find an indication Rose had mostly voted with liberals, so we called Jones, who said that there's nothing in his research, based on Rose's votes throughout his House career, to justify the 90-percent statement. While Rose "votes in a more liberal manner than any Republican in the House," Jones said, "he will be one of the five most conservative Democrats if he comes back." We alerted Casteel to Jones' interpretation; he then shared another way of breaking down Rose's voting record -- based solely on 561 Rose votes during the 2009 legislative session. A research sheet prepared for Isaac's campaign says the selected votes don't include opening-bell procedural votes or votes when no one voted "no." It doesn't specify each vote. The sheet says Rose voted with 11 Democratic colleagues identified as "most liberal" on the Tribune chart 87 to 92 percent of the time, voting 90 percent or more often with six colleagues in the "most liberal" category: Reps. David Leibowitz of San Antonio, Eddie Rodriguez of Austin, Jim Dunnam of Waco and Alma Allen, Garnet Coleman and Ana Hernandez of Houston. In contrast, Isaac's sheet says, Rose voted like the former Republican House speaker, Rep. Tom Craddick of Midland, 65 percent of the time. Back to the professor... Jones said via e-mail that Isaac's camp correctly identified the "most liberal" members using his research. But he said they used a less sophisticated approach by including votes not necessarily reflective of ideology. Casteel said Isaac's statement about Rose proposing nearly $15 billion in spending is based on the projected costs of proposals authored by Rose in the 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 legislative sessions; spreadsheets Casteel provided to us indicate that Rose offered 96 measures over those years that together would have cost the state nearly $14.4 billion through six years. But did they? We asked which of the Rose proposals passed into law. Casteel countered that Isaac was talking about what Rose wanted to spend--not what he passed into law. Why six years, since legislators typically only focus on two years of spending at a time? (That's the length of the budget adopted every odd-numbered year.) Casteel said Isaac's statement relies on the six-year spending forecasts because that's what Rose's ideas would have cost taxpayers over the longer term. Casteel said Isaac's statement that Rose "supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas" refers to a May 21, 2007 floor vote. Online legislative records show that Rose was among 51 members to vote against tabling a proposal by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, directing the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to prepare a report "detailing the means by which this state could insure the maximum number of people and eventually implement a system of universal health care." The motion to table prevailed, killing Burnam's amendment. All in all, does Isaac's prickly statement draw blood? Isaac's largest-tax-increase claim is incorrect. And while Isaac's method of counting votes indicates that Rose votes 90 percent of the time with House liberals, it's based on research conducted by a university professor who says Isaac's message -- that Rose's ideology swings liberal -- isn't justified by Rose's career voting record. Per Isaac's spending charge, the tally of what Rose's proposals would have cost is closer to $14 billion than the nearly $15 billion Isaac proclaims. Also, adding up projected costs over six years--rather than the two years covered by each budget--isn't how lawmakers usually weigh fiscal implications. Isaac's statement that Rose "supported an Obama-style government-run health care system for Texas," reflects Rose's vote against ending debate on a proposal calling for a report on how the state could implement a "universal health care" system. Ordering a feasibility report on universal health care--in action, ahem, more than a year before Obama won election as president--is not the same as endorsing a particular system. We rate Isaac's four-part sally Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05060	Says state Sen. Paul Sarlo "said in February on NJTV, ‘there will be no tax increases in this budget’" and "voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/08/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-state-senator-promised-no-ta/	The Democrat-led Legislature has promised to cut taxes if Gov. Chris Christie hits his revenue targets in the coming months, but the Republican governor has a warning for New Jerseyans: "Be very suspicious." After offering such advice at a June 26 town hall meeting in Ocean County, Christie suggested that Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, had broken a promise not to have any tax hikes in the new state budget. "Oh, and by the way, that same senator, Paul Sarlo, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who said in February on NJTV, ‘there will be no tax increases in this budget,’ voted – voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million," said Christie, according to a video posted June 26 on YouTube. PolitiFact New Jersey found that the governor’s statement is mostly accurate, but missing a couple of critical details. Sarlo (D-Bergen) vowed to not include new taxes in the upcoming budget during a February TV interview and then voted last month to raise income taxes by around $800 million in the new fiscal year. But the governor failed to mention two points: that tax hike technically was separate from the budget bill approved by the Legislature, and it only would have affected taxpayers with more than $1 million in taxable income. First, let’s discuss Sarlo’s earlier comments and recent vote. In a Feb. 22 interview on NJToday, Sarlo said the following in regard to the spending plan for fiscal year 2013, which started July 1: "There will be no new taxes in this budget." But at the June 21 meeting of the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, Sarlo voted for a bill raising the state income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million. That tax hike -- known as the so-called "millionaires tax" -- would generate between $754 million and $836 million in fiscal year 2013, according to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services. The money would be used to boost property tax relief payments. By June 28, the Legislature -- with Sarlo voting yes -- had approved the tax hike. Christie conditionally vetoed the legislation on July 2 and called on legislators to amend the bill to implement a tax cut. Democrats, who set aside $183 million in the fiscal year 2013 budget for a possible tax cut, have said the reduction only would occur if Christie meets his revenue projections between now and December. Now, let’s address the points missing from Christie’s claim. When discussing Sarlo’s vote "to raise income taxes $800 million," the governor failed to mention that the tax hike only would apply to taxable income exceeding $1 million. Unless they’re millionaires, the people at that town hall meeting would not pay higher income taxes. Also, Christie’s statement suggests that the tax hike was part of the budget sent to him by the Legislature. But it technically wasn’t. The millionaires tax bill was separate from the fiscal year 2013 budget bill approved by the Legislature on June 25. Christie approved the budget, with various changes, on June 29. The millionaires tax would have added money to the fiscal year 2013 budget, but it was still considered separately. In a statement issued before Christie’s conditional veto, Derek Roseman, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, said: "This bill was not considered in conjunction with the budget, is not part of the budget, and whatever happens to it will have no impact on the budget." The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling At a town hall meeting, Christie claimed Sarlo "said in February on NJTV, ‘there will be no tax increases in this budget’" and "voted the other night in the Senate Budget Committee to raise income taxes $800 million." It’s accurate that Sarlo said "there will be no new taxes in this budget" and later voted to increase income taxes by around $800 million in the new fiscal year. But Christie failed to mention that the tax hike was considered separately from the budget bill and that it only would have affected millionaires. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-03494	"Our ranking in terms of the best and worst states to do business in was 43 four years ago, and we just moved up to 17 two weeks ago."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/09/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-wisconsins-ranking-place-do-/	Faced with job growth lagging behind most states, Gov. Scott Walker chooses alternative measures to put a positive spin on the state’s economic performance. He touts falling unemployment. He highlights the rebound in manufacturing and the modest tax cuts he pushed through. And he points to improved national rankings for the state’s business climate. In a Milwaukee television interview that aired June 2, 2013, the Republican governor said liberals are pushing the idea that he’s more interested in running for president than being governor because they have no other argument to use against him. "They can’t argue with the success," Walker told host Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s Upfront show. "We went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower. The deficit was $3.6 billion when I took office. We now have a half a billion dollar surplus." He capped off his list with this talking point: "Our ranking in terms of the best and worst states to do business in was 43 four years ago and we just moved up to 17 two weeks ago." Has the state’s business climate rank improved dramatically under Walker, who took office in January 2011? The rankings The governor points to CEO Magazine’s May 2013 ranking of Wisconsin as 17th best for business, based on a survey of chief executive officers nationally. In 2009, as Walker noted, the survey put Wisconsin at 43rd; A year later, the rank was 41. Just a few weeks into his term, early in 2011, the survey ranked the state as 24th. The CEO survey measures perceptions, not performance. It asks CEOs how conducive each state is for business based on taxes and regulation, workforce quality and living environment. What about other studies? We asked Walker’s office, and spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster pointed to: --CNBC’s "America’s Top States for Business," which moved Wisconsin up to 17th from 25th and 29th in the previous two years. That index uses 51 measures of competitiveness. -- Site Selection Magazine’s 2012 elevation of Wisconsin to its top 25 (rank of 13th) states for business climate for the first time since 1998. The study is based in part on surveys of corporate site selectors. Those back up the notion that the business climate has significantly improved under Walker. We found six other widely quoted business-climate rankings, and they show a much more mixed picture. --The Tax Foundation’s "2013 State Business Tax Climate Index" has Wisconsin in the 10 worst states (43rd), based on how 100 tax variables affect competitiveness. That’s typical; the ranking in this study was 43rd and 40th and 42nd in the previous three years. -- Forbes Magazine’s "Best States for Business" put Wisconsin at 42nd in December 2012, with particularly low marks for growth prospects and labor supply. The ranking was 43rd in the year before Walker took office. -- Beacon Hill Institute’s "12th Annual State Competitiveness Report" ranked Wisconsin 18th, an improvement from rankings of 22, 23 and 22 in the prior three years. --The American Legislative Exchange Council’s "2013 ALEC-Laffer State Economic Competitiveness Index" put Wisconsin’s economic outlook ranking at 15th, a big improvement over the 32, 30 and 23 rankings of recent years. The study put the state’s economic performance rank at 41st, a modest improvement over 42 in 2012 and 44 in 2011. Two prominent studies were new or significantly revised, preventing historical comparisons. They show Wisconsin in the bottom half of states for business. --The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked the state 27th in its "U.S. Small Business Policy Index 2012." --The 2013 "Enterprising States: Getting Down to Small Business" study sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranked Wisconsin’s business climate 39th. We should note that business-climate rankings have long attracted criticism from left-leaning groups. "Grading Places," a report by Good Jobs First, a labor-backed group, calls them pseudo-scientific attempts by business-friendly groups trying to justify corporate demands for lower taxes and suppressed wages. This item does not judge the rankings’ reliability, only Walker’s description of the state’s business climate as set out in these rankings. Our rating Walker said the state’s ranking "in terms of the best and worst states to do business in was 43 four years ago, and we just moved up to 17 two weeks ago." That’s correct, in one study of CEO perceptions, but the "state’s ranking" depends on which study you read. The governor cherry-picks the most favorable of three studies on his side, but ignores studies showing much lower rankings and little or no improvement, creating a misleading impression of dramatic improvement. In reality, the rankings are very mixed. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-06-09T09:00:00	2013-06-02	['None']
pomt-08933	Says that Lee Fisher once said, "I never met a gun control bill I didn’t like."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/25/rob-portman/lee-fisher-never-made-infamous-gun-statement/	It’s a quote that keeps on giving, campaign after campaign. It’s even slightly plausible, if you’ve followed Lee Fisher’s positions on gun control. The quote, cited since at least 1994 by gun-rights advocates, political opponents (including the campaign of at least one Democrat), blogs and websites: "I never met a gun control bill I didn’t like." But did Fisher really say it? We turned to groups that have used the quote against Fisher, including the Buckeye Firearms Association, the Ohio Republican Party and the campaign of Rob Portman, the Republican running against Fisher for U.S. Senate. They all suggest his support for the Second Amendment runs from weak to nonexistent. We spoke with people who dealt with Fisher two decades ago and opposed him on issues in the Ohio Senate. We asked the National Rifle Association -- twice -- to dig into its research archives, although the NRA didn’t follow up either time. We checked decades worth of of newspaper clippings and websites, and asked those who keep using the quote to check their records in case they’ve found it. No one has. This has been an ongoing examination ever since the Buckeye Firearms Association and an operative in the campaign of Jennifer Brunner, a Democrat, separately cited the quote during Ohio’s Democratic primary. Fisher won that primary against Brunner, who is Ohio’s secretary of state. They and others noted earlier references to the quote, and not just from this year. The quote was a piece of political folklore, and Fisher had not appeared to do anything to tamp it down until recently. We won’t speculate why, although it’s clear that any discussion of Fisher and guns can get sticky when he says he’s a Second Amendment supporter. Fisher has tried repeatedly to regulate guns, whether from his perch as a former board member of Handgun Control, Inc., or from his service in the Ohio Senate, or from his time as Ohio attorney general. Fisher says that Americans have the right to own guns for protection and sport. But as he said in May on a radio program, "we should do background checks to make it harder for bad guys, or people who have a serious mental illness to get a gun." He embraced assault-weapons bans. Prior to 1993, when Congress passed the so-called Brady Bill to require background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases, Fisher tried repeatedly to get a similar law passed in Ohio. Second Amendment absolutists and many other law-abiding sportsmen disagree with Fisher. Critics cite other statements he has made in support of gun regulation, such as this, from a 1993 memo when Fisher was Ohio attorney general: ''The right to bear arms is a very limited right..." That’s how the Portman campaign characterizes Fisher’s statement, anyway, although the full quote was actually: ''The right to bear arms is a very limited right and the state and its political subdivisions have the authority to regulate the possession and use of assault weapons." So we can stipulate that no matter what Fisher says about his support for the Second Amendment, he and the gun rights lobby are going to be far apart. But what of the "never met" quote? When a Brunner operative and the Buckeye Firearms Association used it during the spring primary, The Plain Dealer mentioned it, writing, "Gun rights advocates as well as Brunner loyalists like to cite Fisher's famous quote from 1994: ‘I never met a gun control bill I didn't like.’" Fisher’s campaign then said it wasn’t sure of the quote’s origin or whether Fisher actually uttered those words. But the Ohio Republican Party used the quote in an online video attack ad in June. Shortly after, Portman used the quote in a campaign news release. Told that The Plain Dealer was looking into the quote’s origins and questioned its authenticity, a Portman spokeswoman defended its usage, saying the quote had been in circulation for years without any record of Fisher disputing it. But Fisher’s campaign refutes the quote now. Fisher never said it, according to spokesman John Collins. We have searched and asked around widely and find nothing that contradicts him, nor did the Buckeye Firearms Association, which turned to its own sources and traced its usage to at least 1994. So where did the quote come from? That’s not entirely clear, but a 1989 column in the Columbus Dispatch sheds some light. Fisher was a state senator then, trying for the fifth time to pass a statewide gun-control law. This time, Fisher’s proposal was getting a second look, and then-state Sen. Paul Pfeifer, the Republican who chaired the Judiciary Committee, indicated he would give Fisher a hearing. Pfeifer, describing the political climate for gun control, told the Dispatch then that Fisher had a reputation of having "never met a gun-control bill he didn’t like." Those were Pfeifer’s words, however, not Fisher’s. Pfeifer, now an Ohio Supreme Court justice, told The Plain Dealer he doesn’t recall details of what he may have said in 1989, but "if you found the quote, then I probably said it." Pfeifer added, "It’s tough enough being responsible for the things you did say" in a long political career. "And it’s hell being blamed for something you never did say." Seems fair enough to us. That’s why we find this claim False. Comment on this item.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2010-07-25T06:15:00	2010-06-28	['None']
pomt-08900	"There's no negative advertising in my campaign at all."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/jul/29/bill-mccollum/negative-campaigning-not-me-says-bill-mccollum/	Bill McCollum tried to put his tougher-than-expected Republican primary for governor into perspective during a discussion with reporters in Tallahassee on July 29, 2010. Here's the upshot: Rick Scott has spent millions of dollars crafting a negative lie-filled television campaign that has distorted voters' impressions of both Scott and McCollum, and voters don't yet have the full story. Asked what he needs to do to turn his campaign around ahead of the Aug. 24 primary, McCollum told reporters, "I'm simply going to be telling the truth about myself. This man's been telling lies on television with millions of dollars for weeks now. And I'm going to get an opportunity to finally spend my own money where I talk about the governor's race." Later, when reporters suggested that McCollum hasn't exactly been Mr. Clean Campaigner himself, the candidate bristled. "Well, look, there's no negative advertising in my campaign at all," McCollum said. "Some of the outside groups have been running advertising that are pointing out the truth about Mr. Scott and that's not negative." No negative advertising at all? As slightly more than casual observers in the governor's race, we found McCollum's statement puzzling. To us, the Scott-McCollum primary duel has been filled with plenty of vitriol -- on both sides -- for the better part of three months. We decided to put our recollection to the test. Let's go to the tapes. First, we need to mention that McCollum's initial TV ad was plenty nice. It features the endorsement of former Gov. Jeb Bush and highlights parts of McCollum's record as attorney general and his 500,000 jobs plan. The ad, you can see it here, includes the traditional images of McCollum speaking with groups of voters and then walking and seemingly giving orders or instructions to worker-type folks. McCollum's second TV ad directly takes on Scott, a former health care CEO who is self-financing his tea party-inspired campaign. The ad starts by playing a soundbite from Scott's own ads. Then, McCollum jumps in. "Rick Scott, let's get real. While your hospitals were profiting from abortions, I voted 100 percent pro-life. "You cashed in helping illegals send American dollars to Mexico. I led the conservative fight to secure our borders and against amnesty. "And while you pocketed $300 million by ripping off taxpayers, as attorney general, I recovered record millions from Medicaid fraud. "You put profit over principle, and that's wrong." But it's McCollum's next TV ad that comes with all the hallmarks of negative campaigning -- namely grainy photos, haunted house-style music, text flying across the screen, and nary a mention of McCollum. The ad is labeled "Innertube" by the McCollum campaign. "He's a special interest insider whose company defrauded Medicare and taxpayers while he pocketed $300 million," a narrator says. In another frame of the ad, a narrator says that while Scott has publicly opposed the federal stimulus, he's involved in companies who received stimulus funds. The claim comes with three images -- stacks of money kind of flopping in a breeze, a screen grab of President Barack Obama and then a screen grab of Scott. There's more: June 10: The St. Petersburg Times gets a hold of a McCollum mailer that is attempting to attack Scott on his abortion position. The front of the mailer has a woman slumped with her back against an industrial style wall, covering her face and pulling her hair. In big red letters that could give a voter the impression of blood, the mailer begins, "It's a shame," then continues in white lettering, "it's clear when it comes to pro-life issues, Rick Scott is ruthless -- his bottom line comes first." The mailer continues on the back, with more blood-red type, by saying that Scott profited from abortions as CEO of the hospital chain, Columbia/HCA. June 27: A robocall from the McCollum campaign: "Meet Mr. Slick -- Rick Scott. "He's been busted twice this week by Florida newspapers for telling whoppers about Bill McCollum. According to the experts, Mr. Slick -- Rick Scott -- and his campaign have been lying about Bill McCollum's position on the issues of abortion and immigration. "Between Obama and Crist, Floridians are tired of typical politicians willing to say anything to be elected. In August Republicans have a choice. Let's restore principled conservative leadership to Tallahassee. Vote for Bill McCollum." June 28: A fundraising letter by McCollum calls Scott a "disgraced" and "lousy manager" whose hands are "filthy" regarding Medicaid fraud at Columbia/HCA. "He's lucky he's not in prison," McCollum writes in the letter. "And now with a shameless audacity that would make Bill Clinton blush, he says he wants to bring his business savvy and acumen to Tallahassee." July 2: In a web ad, the McCollum campaign says Scott's excuse -- that he didn't know about the fraud at Columbia/HCA -- is "like saying a mafia kingpin doesn't know about his henchmen's crimes." As the narrator says the line, a floating head of Scott is given a black fedora and a trench coat. Then money starts flying through the frame of the ad. Then Scott starts to spin in circles and gets bigger. Then someone starts laughing. July 15: A new mailer, called the Two Faces of Rick Scott doesn't include any mention of McCollum. Instead, it claims that "Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy" (which PolitiFact Florida rated Barely True) and that "Rick Scott's company creates products for the gambling industry." July 27: A new web ad attacks Scott's time at Columbia/HCA, saying he got a $310 million golden parachute "courtesy of American taxpayers." The $310 million represents Scott's severance package when he left Columbia/HCA. The ad is set to Rick Astley's song, "Never Gonna Give You Up," which has become part of a Internet fad called "Rickrolling," where people think they're watching one thing, then get bait-and-switched with Astley's song. We should note that these are all advertisements by McCollum's campaign, and not the 527 groups that are supporting his candidacy. That means McCollum has final approval over their content. And we should make clear that Scott's hands aren't clean himself (See here, here and here, for starters). Determining whether McCollum's ads are all truly "negative," or rather what politicians like to call "contrast" ads, is something of a subjective exercise. Contrast ads typically say things like "Candidate A is for this, well I'm for that." Or, "Candidate A says he'll be tough on crime, but he voted for this." Leaving some room for leeway, we don't want to make a blanket statement that everything we found should be classified as negative. But calling your opponent Mr. Slick, or dressing him up in a fedora and trench coat meets a common-sense definition of negative advertising. So does an abortion mailer with blood-red type, or a TV ad that focuses entirely on your opponent, and uses gimmicks like spooky music and grainy photos. McCollum said "there's no negative advertising in my campaign at all." But there's plenty of evidence to the contrary, and a seasoned campaigner like McCollum has to know it.

pomt-08094	"[State Rep. Doug McKillip’s] donors deserve a refund."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/15/jane-kidd/party-switchers-anger-leaders-dont-have-refund-con/	The 2010 election didn’t put an end to the growth of the Georgia Republican Party, which now dominates state government. After the ballots were counted, six members of the state House of Representatives and one state senator who raised money, ran for office and were elected as Democrats jumped to the GOP. "Foul!" cried Democrats. And when state Rep. Doug McKillip of District 115 in Athens bolted for the Republicans earlier this month, party officials ramped up the rhetoric. McKillip switched parties after he was elected chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. Party officials were outwardly angry with McKillip, the No. 2 Democrat in the House. Democrats openly called McKillip a "turncoat" and ended one press release about the defection with the formal definition of a "Traitor: One who betrays another's trust or is false to an obligation or duty." "His donors deserve a refund; his voters deserve a recall," state Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kidd pronounced in the Dec. 7 press release, a day after McKillip's party change. But do they? We at PolitiFact Georgia specifically wondered if there is anything that mandates a party-switcher to reimburse the folks who gave the candidate money. After all, most of those donors probably assumed McKillip would serve the party whose banner he carried during the election. McKillip said he has no immediate plans to make refunds. "No one has asked me to refund any money," he said in a telephone interview. "I would certainly discuss it with anyone who asked for a refund. "I’m getting five-to-one positive reaction." Kidd was not among the positive. "I used the word ‘deserve’ because I believe it," Kidd told PolitiFact Georgia. "I think it’s a dishonest act to run in one party and then switch after you win." But Kidd admitted she knew of nothing that would mandate a refund to donors. Michael Jablonski, general counsel for the state Democratic Party, said he was unaware of anyone who has refunded donor money after a party switch. "He has a moral obligation to return money to donors who thought he was a Democrat," Jablonski said. "He should also resign so there can be a special election so people can determine if they want a Democrat or Republican in that office." Jablonski pointed PolitiFact to the Democratic Party’s bylaws, which address any money given to a candidate by the party. Section BL1.8.2 states: "The State Party shall seek reimbursement of any contribution, whether real or in-kind, made to a candidate who qualifies for office as a Democrat and, after qualification, switches to another party." A review of McKillip’s campaign contribution reports on file with the State Ethics Commission, however, do not show any direct contributions by the state party to his campaign. Kerwin Swint, political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said he was unaware of anything that would force a party-switcher to return campaign cash. "There have been instances of officials returning money," he said, "but it’s totally voluntarily." Democratic Party spokesman Eric Gray predicted McKillip’s donors will seek revenge during the next election cycle. "There will be political repercussions for Doug as the people in his district vote him out in two years," Gray said. "It’s a liberal Democratic district." Perhaps. But the state Legislature also will be redrawing its new political boundaries as part of the 10-year redistricting cycle before the next election. And McKillip’s newfound party will be in charge of that effort. Democratic officials are entitled to the belief that party defectors should refund donors' campaign contributions. But the idea that a party-switcher actually owes refunds to his donors has no grounding in party rules or in state law. We rule the claim False.

pomt-01792	U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn "earned as much as $300,000 running a nonprofit that had laid off 90 workers."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/25/ending-spending-action-fund/super-pac-goes-after-nunn-layoffs-raise/	Even before David Perdue’s snatched the GOP U.S. Senate nomination from longtime Congressman Jack Kingston on Tuesday, the Ending Spending Action Fund was out with a television ad attacking the Democrat in the race, Michelle Nunn. Nunn, the daughter of former Democratic U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, is viewed as one of the party’s best hopes for reclaiming a high-profile statewide office and for helping the party retain its majority in the U.S. Senate. The Ending Spending Action Fund is a conservative, well-funded super political action committee that originally focused on earmarks but has expanded its message and targets. It was founded by Joe Ricketts, the former CEO of TD Ameritrade and a known conservative backer whose family owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Brian Baker, the group’s president, was an adviser to former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. The group’s attack ad on Nunn began running last weekend and is being aired statewide. The 30-second spot tries to tie Nunn to President Barack Obama (opening with an image of the two of them) and the Affordable Care Act. It also criticizes her leadership as CEO of the nonprofit Points of Light Foundation. "Come on -- Nunn earned as much as $300,000 running a nonprofit that had laid off 90 workers," the ad states. "Do you really think she’ll look out for us in Washington?" PolitiFact Georgia decided that was a claim worth checking. The Ending Spending Action Fund’s current attack ad makes some of the same charges that the group’s pre-primary spots did. Among them is a claim that Nunn supports higher taxes. PolitiFact in April rated that specific claim Mostly False. We reached out to Baker this week on the latest ad. He told us the PAC has spent about $900,000 on two anti-Nunn ads -- the one before the primary and the current spot. "We opposed no other candidates besides Nunn and (Republican U.S. Rep. Phil) Gingrey," he said in an email. Gingrey lost in the crowded May 20th GOP Senate primary that landed Perdue and Kingston in the runoff. Baker sent us a summary of the PAC’s ad research, including excerpts from articles in Politico, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and National Review about the merger of HandsOn Network, a nonprofit Nunn helped establish and ran, and the Points of Light Foundation, a service-oriented organization inspired by President George H.W. Bush. The research also focused on the layoff of 90 to 95 of the two groups’ combined 175 employees, as well as a jump in Nunn’s salary from $120,00 at Atlanta-based Handsn Network to $250,00 at Points of Light. Tax records show that Nunn’s salary was $250,000 in 2007, the first year she took over as CEO at Points of Light. Her total compensation three years later exceeded $300,000. Those same tax records show that her Points of Light predecessor, Robert K. Goodwin, earned $325,000 during his last full year on the job. Nunn told Politico that an executive committee set her salary and that she had argued for it to be lower than Goodwin’s because "of the tough times we were going through." Of the layoffs, Nunn said, they were necessary "in order to have the strength and success we’ve had today." Two years after the two groups merged, Neil Bush, a son of the first President Bush and chairman of the Points of Light board, described to the Chronicle of Philanthropy why the merger was needed. "The Points of Light Foundation, honestly, being an inside-the-Beltway Washington institution, became a little too dependent on federal funding, a little too bloated for the work it was engaged in," Bush told the Chronicle. Others said they initially wondered whether Nunn would make the hard decisions needed to make the merger work -- including the layoffs. "She clearly came through," Walt Shill, a managing director at Accenture Management Consulting, told the Chronicle in October 2009. The Chronicle of Philanthropy recently described Nunn as one of the most visible faces in a burgeoning national movement to promote volunteerism. Under her leadership, Points of Light has a $30 million-plus budget and 250 affiliates across the country, according to the group. Nunn’s on leave from the organization while she campaigns. She and Perdue face off in November to succeed retiring Republican U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. At Points of Light, Nunn’s annual salary has fluctuated. It was $197,506 in 2008 and 2009, according to the organization’s Form 990s. The annual filings show Nunn received $322,056 in total compensation in 2010, with a base compensation of $285,533. She took a cut in compensation in 2011, down to $299,346, with a base salary of $274,793. To sum up our findings on the new ad: The Ending Spending Action Fund is correct that about 90 jobs were abolished when HandsOn Network and Points of Light joined forces. It is also correct that Nunn has earned as much as $300,000 annually as head of the charity, getting a significant raise after the merger. Nunn got a huge raise while some employees were getting pink slips. But a bit of context is needed. Layoffs following mergers are common. And a nonprofit’s success can hinge on whether the public believes that it’s operating as efficiently as possible. Nunn’s salary at Points of Light, meanwhile, was less than her predecessor’s. We rate the statement in the ad as Mostly True.	None	Ending Spending Action Fund	None	None	None	2014-07-25T00:00:00	2014-07-20	['United_States']
pomt-13027	Alison Alter "got an F in attendance in 2016" as an Austin parks board member "and was removed by a unanimous vote of the Austin City Council."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/dec/02/sheri-gallo/sheri-gallo-misses-claim-alison-alter-removed-boar/	In a flier mailed to voters, Austin City Council Member Sheri Gallo says her opponent in the Dec. 13, 2016, runoff to represent West Austin’s District 10 "got an F in attendance in 2016 as a Parks Board member and was removed by a unanimous vote of the Austin City Council." Not so, we found. Gallo’s claim caught our eye because we remembered the incumbent giving a different explanation in August 2016 when she asked council colleagues to remove Alison Alter from the all-volunteer panel after Alter, a philanthropic adviser, signaled plans to challenge Gallo, who worked as a real estate agent before her election to the council. Just the year before, Gallo nominated Alter to represent the district on the board. The 11-member City Council accepted her recommendation in May 2015 and Alter was eligible to begin her service a couple months later. When Gallo made her motion to remove Alter from the board, Gallo said she was acting after Alter refused to resign. On Aug. 4, 2016, Gallo’s colleagues approved Gallo’s request without discussion as part of the meeting’s consent agenda, which typically consists of uncontroversial items that are passed in a single council vote. "I asked Ms. Alter to resign from the Parks and Recreation Board because of her inherent conflict of interest due to her intention to run against me for City Council," Gallo said in an Aug. 4, 2016, statement. "It would be difficult for her to represent both me and the District 10 office in good faith while actively campaigning against me." Gallo made no mention then of Alter’s attendance. For this fact check, we reached out to Gallo’s campaign by phone and email, seeking the factual basis for her claim that Alter’s "F" for attendance preceded her removal from the board. Gallo’s campaign cited those two missed 2016 board meetings in an email to PolitiFact, defending the claim. Separately, we checked on Alter’s attendance history by reviewing meeting minutes for the 11-member parks board. From January to July 2016, the period claimed by Gallo, the minutes indicate the board had six meetings, and a subcommittee Alter served on also had six meetings. Alter missed two of each--meaning she missed one-third of the year’s meetings. But that’s an incomplete accounting. The year before, Alter was absent from her initial full board meeting on July 28, 2015, according to that meeting’s minutes. Yet she was present at each of her next eight meetings of the year--from Aug. 25 through Dec. 8, 2015--including three committee meetings, according to respective meeting minutes. All told then, Alter was present at 16 of 21 parks board or subcommittee meetings until her removal. That breaks out to a 76 percent attendance record, arguably a ‘C’ letter grade. We wondered if the city in any way grades or ranks board members on attendance. At our request, city spokesman David Green emailed us the city’s log of attendance for the parks board; it didn’t include attendance grades or such. Green said too that the city clerk’s office, which tracks board and council absences, doesn’t rank or grade members on attendance. Our ruling Gallo said Alter "got an F in attendance in 2016 as a Parks Board member and was removed by a unanimous vote of the Austin City Council." This claim gets events flat wrong in that we found no evidence that Alter’s removal from the board--which occurred at Gallo’s behest--had anything to do with missed meetings. Austin volunteers who serve on city boards don’t get graded on attendance. Still, if Alter were graded on her entire tenure rather than a cherry-picked stretch, she’d merit a passing grade of ‘C.’ We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-01977	It would be illegal for the Fulton County Commission to raise the county tax rate.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/18/john-albers/it-illegal-if-fulton-skirts-law/	The curious image of Fulton County commissioners being led away in handcuffs – for the crime of voting on their annual budget – recently popped into PolitiFact’s head. The reason? Fulton is taking steps to raise its countywide tax rate for the first time since 1991. Leaders in Georgia’s largest county say the state constitution was on their side when they voted last year to repeal a property tax cap that affects only Fulton. That set the stage for this year’s proposed increase. But state lawmakers point to House Bill 604, which bars Fulton from raising taxes until 2015. Any tax increase above the rollback rate – the millage that would raise the same money as last year – violates that law. "Contrary to law, the Fulton County Commission has taken preliminary action to move forward to increase property taxes," state Sen. John Albers, R-Roswell, wrote in an email blast to constituents. "This is both illegal and immoral." Illegal? That gives us the image of time in the clink – and makes it necessary to vet this one quickly since Fulton is taking up the issue of advertising the tax increase at its meeting Wednesday. Fulton Commission Chairman John Eaves says the law created by HB 604 violates the state constitution by singling out the county and removing the job of its leadership to set taxes. Moreover, advertising a rate increase doesn’t mean the County Commission will move forward to raise taxes, he said. The commission could lower the rate from the one advertised when it adopts the final rate this summer. "A final millage rate will not be set until our citizens have had an opportunity to be heard," Eaves said. "We are duly elected to ensure that the services our citizens have come to expect are available to them." The tax for general county services in Fulton is currently 10.211 mills. That’s about $817 on a $275,000 home with the $30,000 homestead exemption. The proposed rate of 11.781 mills – a 17 percent increase above the rollback and a 15 percent jump from the existing rate -- would add about $125 to the bill from last year and $140 from the rollback rate. State lawmakers from north Fulton have battled with the Democratic-led County Commission for years, saying their constituents do not get their money’s worth for those taxes. After unsuccessfully pursuing state legislation to split Fulton into two counties by lopping off the northern part, lawmakers drove home their belief that county government spends too much money by passing HB 604. "Fulton County already has a bloated budget, and this is us trying to make them responsible and follow the law," Albers said. "If not, we will seek a court battle, and that just means taxpayers will be paying even more to fight themselves. That makes no sense." But does disagreeing with a law mean acting against it is illegal? Reminding us of why people hate lawyers (and reporters), the legal experts say no. Unlawful, and illegal, are not synonyms in the technical sense, said Jack Williams, a professor of law at Georgia State University. The legislative branch of government – whether it’s the Legislature at the state level or a county commission locally – can adopt laws and speak to whether something is lawful, Williams said. But in our separated system, it’s up to the courts to decide whether a law is legal. For instance, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But not until 2012, when the Supreme Court upheld what’s become known as Obamacare, did it become legal. "It’s a political statement. It’s not a legal one," Williams said of the "illegal" claim. "He may be right in the end, but we don’t know yet. That’s why we pay taxes to build courthouses." But does it matter that most people aren’t attorneys and therefore have a different understanding of what "illegal" means? Maybe. After all, elected officials are sworn into office promising to act in accordance with state law and the constitution, said Mary Dudziak, a professor of law at Emory University. "Acting contrary to (the law) would be a law violation, whether or not a court has ever ruled on it," Dudziak said. "And it is not out of line for a lawmaker to say that a local tax is ‘unlawful’ because it is in conflict with a state statute." Ah, which brings us back to the difference between unlawful – something that violates a law – and illegal – a court’s decision on whether a law can be enforced. In that sense, parsing words matter. Albers said it would be "illegal" for Fulton to raise its taxes. That isn’t up to him any more than it is to the commission, regardless of common understanding of the word. For that reason, we rate his statement as Mostly True.	None	John Albers	None	None	None	2014-06-18T00:00:00	2014-06-14	['None']
pomt-08920	"We've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/27/timothy-geithner/geithner-claims-us-had-six-months-positive-job-gro/	During the July 25, 2010 segment of ABC's This Week, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner defended President Barack Obama's economic track record. He specifically brought up the successes that the administration has had in boosting activity in the private sector. "But right now, the best thing the government can do...is help create the conditions for the private sector to start to invest in hiring again. Now, we've seen six months of positive job growth by the private sector. That's pretty good." We don't have the expertise to evaluate what constitutes "pretty good" job growth, but we can check the claim that the growth has been positive for the last six months. We visited the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of our favorite federal number crunchers. On July 2, 2010, the bureau released its monthly Current Employment Statistics Highlights report. On page five, the report contains statistics on seasonally adjusted private sector employment going back to January 2000. Geithner specifically referenced the last six months of the current year, so that's where we focused our attention. In December 2009, the private sector shed 83,000 jobs. That was significantly smaller than the average drop for the year, since the private-sector employment losses averaged 388,000 per month during 2009, according to the report. And so we come to 2010. How have we fared for the past six months? Here's a quick monthly summary of jobs added: January: 16,000 February: 62,000 March: 158,000 April: 241,000 May: 33,000 June: 83,000 Data for the month of July --which wasn't over when Geithner spoke -- won't be released until August, so that's the most up-to-date data available. The report notes that data for the two most recent months are preliminary. But unless there's an unusually big after-the fact correction for either month, it's pretty clear that Geithner was correct. We've seen positive job growth in the private sector from January to June. We rate this True.	None	Timothy Geithner	None	None	None	2010-07-27T12:01:22	2010-07-25	['None']
pomt-15126	"Almost 40 percent of all (undocumented) immigrants come by plane and they overstay their visas."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/08/jorge-ramos/ramos-40-undocumented-immigrants-come-air/	Depending on which poll you believe, between 40 and 50 percent of Americans support building a wall or fence along the border with Mexico. Jorge Ramos, a news anchor on Univision and Fusion, makes no secret of his disdain for the idea. A few days after attracting widespread notice after being thrown out of a Donald Trump press conference while asking a question on immigration policy (he was later allowed back in), Ramos accepted an invitation to appear on Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor on Sept. 2, 2015. Host Bill O’Reilly’s first question pressed him on the issue of a border wall. O’Reilly: "You don’t want a border wall. You don’t want that. Why not?" Ramos: "It’s a completely absurd idea. Why would you want to build a 1,900-mile wall between Mexico and the United States if almost 40 percent of all immigrants come by plane and they overstay their visas?" Ramos is far from the first person to deploy the statistic that 40 percent of unauthorized immigrants come into the country under a legal visa and then stay beyond its expiration date. Two Republican presidential candidates, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have said the same thing. When we checked Rubio’s claim, we rated it Mostly True. However, Ramos’ statement adds the wrinkle that these people typically arrive by plane to rebut the notion that a wall would stop unauthorized immigration. As it turns out, it's hard to prove how they travel. Actually, 40 percent might be too low The key research on "overstays" -- the working term for this group of unauthorized immigrants Ramos had in mind -- was undertaken in 1997 by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS estimated that overstays accounted for 41 percent of the undocumented. Here we’ll add a bit of complexity. Immigration researchers divide the undocumented into two groups -- overstays and "entries without inspection." The first group might have a student, temporary work or tourist visa. The second group never went through any review. Robert Warren -- who helped with that work at the INS and now is a senior fellow at the Center for Migration Studies, a research group founded by Catholic missionaries -- told PunditFact that not only does the balance between the two still hold, it has likely tilted toward the overstays. "Since 2000, arrivals from Mexico, who are about 85-90 percent 'entries without inspection,' have plummeted, while overstays have increased, or stayed at about their historical levels," Warren said. Warren said the shift likely stems from U.S. efforts that have made it harder to enter by land. He sent us this graph from his latest research at the center. Source: Center for Migration Studies Analysts with two other organizations, the Pew Research Center and the Migration Policy Institute, largely back Warren’s overall estimates. "It is likely that the 40 percent figure is still valid and, if anything, the share of unauthorized immigrants who are visa overstayers is probably higher than 40 percent," said Jeffrey Passel at Pew. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said his group uses a wider range for overstays of one-third to one-half. While he’s comfortable with that, he noted it ultimately goes back to data collected by Pew in 2006. "It’s widely cited and generally accepted as accurate, but it should be taken with a grain of salt because the estimate is old and characterized by some uncertainty," he said. Rosenblum said the Department of Homeland Security has developed a way to count overstays who arrive by air or sea, but so far, the department doesn’t seem to have settled on an approach for people who enter at a land port of entry, such as the southern border. We reached out to a couple of agencies within the department, but did not get any information. Guesstimating the fliers If the 40 percent stat is defensible, the point that all those people arrive by air is much less so. In fact, the limited data we have suggests that whatever fraction flies into the country, it is less than 40 percent. When we asked Ramos for his source, he pointed us to a 2006 report by Pew. However, while that assessment provides the 40 percent figure, it gives no details on the fraction that arrived in an airplane. All of the experts we asked said they could only provide a gut assessment on this question. "I have no information" on the form of transportation used by overstayers at the time of their entry, Pew’s Passel said, "but I suspect that most of them do arrive by plane." But Rosenblum noted that overstays represent about 16 percent of unauthorized Mexican immigrants, about 27 percent of unauthorized Central Americans, and about 91 percent of all other unauthorized immigrants. Using his group’s estimates of the unauthorized population, that translates into about a third of all overstays coming from Mexico and Central America, and about two-thirds coming from the rest of the world. "Many, but not all, of the Mexican and Central American overstayers likely arrived legally by land," Rosenblum said. "Almost all of the other overstayers likely arrived by air." So let’s assume that none of the Mexican and Central American arrivals came by air, but all of the other arrivals did fly in. Since two-thirds of the overstays come from places other than Mexico and Central America, that would mean that two-thirds of the overstay population (the 40 percent figure) came by air, or about 27 percent. That’s not far from the result Warren got using a slightly different approach. He estimated that at least one-third of the undocumented population arrives by air. Ramos acknowledged the lack of hard data behind his statement. "The important fact is that around 40 percent came legally and then overstayed their visas," he said. "How they got here is another matter." A final note: The rationale for building a wall between the United States and Mexico is strongly linked to the idea that illegal immigration is fundamentally a problem of a porous southern border. Ramos, Rubio and Bush use the 40 percent figure to highlight that a large portion of the problem lies elsewhere. However, Rosenblum noted that does not make the two groups equivalent. "One difference between overstayers and those who enter unlawfully is that overstayers have been screened and found admissible at least once, while those who enter another way -- mostly by crossing the border, or passing illegally through a port of entry -- could include people who would be inadmissible, because they have committed serious crimes or are on a security watchlist," Rosenblum said. "This is a legitimate reason to be more focused on illegal entries than overstayers." Our ruling Ramos said that about 40 percent of undocumented immigrants fly into the country and overstay their visas. While there is some evidence that overstays represent about 40 percent of the unauthorized population, and perhaps more, the best estimates of those flying in -- which are admittedly a bit shaky -- could be as low as one-quarter or somewhat more than one-third. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. Editor's note: Shortly after we published this fact-check, we added the word "undocumented" in parenthesis to our ruling statement to clarify the context of Ramos' remarks, specifically that he was speaking of undocumented immigrants, not all immigrants. The rating remains the same. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jorge Ramos	None	None	None	2015-09-08T13:19:23	2015-09-02	['None']
pomt-04775	"In 2008, candidate Barack Obama attacked John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/26/mitt-romney/romney-ad-says-obama-attacked-mccain-medicare-08/	As the presidential campaigns trade attacks about Medicare, a new TV ad from Mitt Romney accuses President Barack Obama of hypocrisy. The ad says that in 2008, Obama attacked his opponent, U.S. Sen. John McCain, for wanting to cut Medicare -- and then did so himself to to pay for Obamacare. The ad uses a clip of Obama speaking at a campaign rally in October 2008. "Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth," Obama says from a podium. The ad then says Obama "cut $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare" -- a claim PolitiFact previously rated Half True -- and concludes with another clip of Obama saying "it ain’t right." "No, Mr. President," the announcer says, "it ain't right." Here, we’ll rewind to 2008 to see how candidate Obama handled the delicate topic of Medicare. It turns out we fact-checked Obama's claim back then. Rallying voters in Virginia We went back to a transcript of the 2008 event to make sure Obama's comments were not taken out of context. Speaking before a crowd of more than 8,000 on Oct. 17, 2008, Obama unloaded on McCain’s Medicare proposal, according to a transcript of the event: "It turns out, Sen. McCain would pay for part of his plan by making drastic cuts in Medicare, $882 billion worth, $882 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for an ill-conceived, badly thought-through health care plan that won't provide more health care, to people, even though Medicare is already facing a looming shortfall. "Now, this should come as no surprise. It's entirely consistent with Sen. McCain's record during his 26 years in Congress, where time and again he's opposed Medicare. In fact, Sen. McCain has voted against protecting Medicare 40 times -- 40 times, he's failed to stand up for Medicare. "So what would Sen. McCain's cuts mean for Medicare, at a time when more and more Americans are relying on it? It would mean a cut of more than 20 percent in Medicare benefits next year. "If you count on Medicare, it would mean fewer places to get care and less freedom to choose your own doctors. You'll pay more for your drugs. You'll receive fewer services. You'll get lower-quality care. "I don't think that's right. In fact, it ain't right. (Cheers.) When you've worked hard your whole life and pay into the system and done everything right, you shouldn't have the carpet pulled out from under you when you least expect it and can least afford it." An ad, and ensuing criticism Back in 2008, the Obama campaign released a television ad making the same basic claim. "How would your golden years turn out under John McCain?" the announcer said in the 2008 ad. "His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 billion. That means a 22 percent cut in benefits. Higher premiums and co-pays. More expensive prescription drugs. Nursing home care could suffer. ... After a lifetime of work, seniors' health care shouldn't be a gamble. John McCain's plan? It's not the change we need." PolitiFact examined the claim from Obama’s speech about McCain’s Medicare plan and rated it False. "McCain has never talked about Medicare benefit and service cuts to pay for his health care plan. Instead, his campaign says it would achieve the necessary cost savings by overhauling Medicare reimbursement policies, streamlining treatments for certain chronic diseases, cracking down on fraud and waste, expanding the use of lower-cost generic drugs and assorted other steps," we wrote. While not the same in every detail, McCain’s ideas for cost savings sound an awful lot like the ones Obama has pursued as president. The New York Times was similarly critical of the 2008 ad, saying it "does mischaracterize Mr. McCain's plan by stitching together vague language from a news report with back-of-the envelope calculations by a partisan policy group." Our ruling Romney’s new ad says "candidate Barack Obama attacked John McCain for proposing cuts to Medicare." That's an accurate description of what Obama said. We rate Romney's claim True.

pomt-12672	The proposed state budget contains "an additional tax cut for the middle class."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2017/mar/17/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-budget-does-not-include-new-tax-cuts/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says tax rates will drop for the middle class as long as they remain high for the rich. As state budget talks begin to heat up, that is his pitch for extending what’s called the millionaires’ tax - an 8.82 percent income tax on those earning more than $1 million annually. That rate will fall to 6.85 percent if the tax is not extended. The additional tax bracket was created under former Gov. David Paterson and then extended by Cuomo and the Legislature in 2013. It's due to sunset at the end of this year. But Cuomo wants to extend it for another three years. In return, he promises lower taxes for the middle class. "We want to start right out of the box by doing an additional tax cut for the middle class because the best thing we can say to our middle-class brothers and sisters is, 'You know what, government is going to take less of your paycheck every week.' " Critics say Cuomo is misleading the public. They say the tax cuts Cuomo is talking about were already passed in last year’s budget. Those rates are scheduled to be the lowest in 70 years when phased in. "Senate says drop the millionaires’ tax. Assembly says raise the millionaires’ tax. I say, continue it as is," Cuomo said. "I also propose in my budget a middle income tax cut. But if you allow the millionaires’ tax to expire, that $3.5 billion loss of revenue devastates the budget. And forget all the proposals." So, which is it? Are there new tax cuts in Cuomo’s budget, or were they already passed last year? A promise or threat? It is true that state tax rates for the middle class are slated to go down. Last year's budget included tax cuts for married filers making between $27,750 and $321,050, as well as for single filers making between $13,850 and $214,000. The cuts are scheduled to be phased in from 2018 through 2025. But Cuomo’s proposed budget legislation doesn't contain any additional cuts. It extends the millionaires' tax through 2020. A Cuomo administration spokesman says that still counts as a tax cut this year. Without an extension of the millionaires’ tax, last year's cuts could be amended or eliminated to balance the books, the spokesman said. "That’s not the governor fighting for a middle-class tax cut. That’s the governor threatening to take away a middle-class tax cut," said Ken Girardin of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a non-partisan, non-profit think tank based in Albany that calls for policy reforms based on free-market principles, personal responsibility and effective and accountable government. Cuomo’s budget proposal won’t change anything for the middle class compared to last year’s agreement, Girardin said. "The legislature could take a one-year hiatus to Saint Lucia and middle-class tax rates would still go down," Girardin said. Our ruling Cuomo said he’s proposing "an additional tax cut for the middle class" in this year’s budget. The tax rates in Cuomo’s proposed budget are not new. They were approved in last year’s budget but are not scheduled to begin until 2018. Middle-class tax rates will decline as scheduled if lawmakers leave them alone. Granted, everything is up for negotiation in a state budget, including tax rates. Legislative leaders could agree to change tax rates as part of this year’s spending plan. But Cuomo’s statement ignores facts and gives a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2017-03-17T18:10:38	2017-02-23	['None']
pomt-13055	Ed Gillespie "would not mention (Donald Trump’s) name unless he was condemning him."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/nov/21/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-stretches-ed-gillespies-statements/	Although Corey Stewart was ousted as Donald Trump’s campaign chairman in Virginia this fall, he’s still anchoring his gubernatorial campaign to the GOP president-elect. In the wake of Trump’s victory, the chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors took aim at Ed Gillespie who, like Stewart, is seeking the Republican nomination for governor. "Ed Gillespie treated Donald Trump like he had typhoid," Stewart said in a post-election interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch. "He would not appear with him on stage. He would not mention his name unless he was condemning him." The record on the first part of Stewart’s statement - that Gillespie would not appear with Trump - doesn’t lend itself to a fact-check because it requires us to get into Gillespie’s head. Gillespie never did appear on stage with Trump in Virginia, but there’s no evidence he refused to do so. Gillespie’s campaign says he was never invited by Trump’s camp and we’ve found no information to contradict that. So we’ll fact check the second part of Stewart’s statement - that Gillespie only mentioned Trump’s name when he was "condemning him." When we reached out to Stewart, he repeated that Gillespie kept Trump at an arm’s length and "never mentioned Trump" in a positive light. Stewart said that early in the campaign, Gillespie simply made a generic vow to support the GOP nominee. The only time Gillespie mentioned Trump by name, Stewart said, was to take the him to task following a release of a 2005 Access Hollywood tape in which Trump made vulgar comments about groping women. Gillespie did criticize Trump for that, calling the candidate’s comments "incredibly offensive and demeaning." But contrary to Stewart’s statement, there were a few times when Gillespie did mention Trump’s name - tepidly - while voicing support for the GOP ticket. Matt Moran, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, pointed out those occasions. •A May 4 article in The Washington Post that noted Gillespie issued a one-sentence, prepared statement of support for Trump. The statement said, "Republican voters have nominated Donald Trump for president, and I will vote for him against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in an election that will not only affect control of the White House but the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation or more." •A May podcast interview with Bearing Drift, a conservative blog. Gillespie said, "It’s very important that we help Donald Trump carry the commonwealth against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders because we play a critically important role in the Electoral College." •An Aug. 23 interview with the Loudoun Times that was recorded by Gillespie’s campaign. "I’m voting for Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton," Gillespie said. "That is our choice in this election. It’s not just about the control of the executive branch for the next four years, but control of the judiciary for the next 30 years." No doubt, Gillespie’s actions on Trump will be an issue in next year’s GOP primary for governor. Stewart isn’t the only Trump supporter accusing Gillespie of shunning the president-elect this fall. John Fredericks, who served as chairman of Trump’s campaign during the final month after Stewart was ousted, also said that Gillespie kept Trump at arm’s length. "This was a cold, calculating political decision that he made that he’ll have to live with now," John Fredericks said of Gillespie. Fredericks became chairman of Trump’s Virginia campaign in October, after Stewart was fired for making unauthorized comments. But Fredericks also acknowledged that he never asked Gillespie to appear with Trump and, therefore, can’t say definitively if Gillespie "would not" do so. Fredericks told us that that Gillespie did attend two rallies held by Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. They were held in Harrisonburg on Oct. 5 and at George Mason University on Nov. 5. At the latter event, Fredericks said he introduced Gillespie, who never mentioned Trump in his speech. While Gillespie is taking hits from Republicans for distancing himself from Trump, the state Democratic Party is trying to tie him to the president-elect. The Democrats started a "Trump for Virginia governor" website that claims Gillespie, Stewart and other GOP gubernatorial candidates are "YUUGE Trump supporters." Finally, we should finally note that Stewart was fired as the Trump campaign’s Virginia chairman on Oct.10 after joining a rally in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington where he accused GOP "establishment pukes" of failing to sufficiently support Trump’s campaign. Our ruling Stewart said Gillespie "would not mention" Trump’s name "unless he was condemning him." Gillespie certainly did not praise Trump, and he did criticize the presidential nominee for making a vulgar statement about women. But there are several instances where Gillespie mentioned Trump while voicing support of the GOP ticket, saying it was important to keep conservative control of the U.S. Supreme Court. So we rate Stewart’s statement False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/cf171a22-e911-49e7-868b-1a84bf9498e4	None	Corey Stewart	None	None	None	2016-11-21T02:00:00	2016-11-09	['Ed_Gillespie']
pomt-10260	McCain "said he was 'stumped' when asked whether contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/26/planned-parenthood/this-condom-speaks-the-truth/	With Sen. John McCain aggressively courting supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton, some of the most fervent of which are especially concerned with women's issues, the advocacy group Planned Parenthood has been spreading the word about why it believes women should oppose McCain. To that end, the group employed one of the more attention-getting novelty items of the campaign thus far on Aug. 25, 2008, handing out condoms at a party near the Democratic National Convention in Denver, each bright-pink package bearing the message "Protect Yourself from John McCain" and one of 10 reasons the group believes voters — especially women — shouldn't vote for him. The group said it plans to distribute 30,000 of the condoms at the convention. The 10 reasons were various claims about McCain's stances on women's issues, such as the well-known fact that he opposes Roe vs. Wade , and the opinion that he opposes certain "commonsense" funding for contraception and education. We decided to look at Reason 9: McCain "Said he was 'stumped' when asked whether contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV." The claim is rooted in a comment — arguably a gaffe — that came during one of the freewheeling conversations with reporters aboard the Straight Talk Express that McCain commonly held earlier in the campaign. Here's a transcript of part of the conversation, which took place in Iowa on March 16, 2007. And here's the crucial exchange: Planned Parenthood condoms carrying statement about candidate John McCain. Q: "What about grants for sex education in the United States? Should they include instructions about using contraceptives? Or should it be Bush's policy, which is just abstinence?" McCain: (Long pause) "Ahhh. I think I support the president's policy." Q: "So no contraception, no counseling on contraception. Just abstinence. Do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV?" McCain: (Long pause) "You've stumped me." Q: "I mean, I think you'd probably agree it probably does help stop it?" McCain: (Laughs) "Are we on the Straight Talk Express? I'm not informed enough on it. Let me find out. You know, I'm sure I've taken a position on it on the past. I have to find out what my position was. Brian, would you find out what my position is on contraception — I'm sure I'm opposed to government spending on it, I'm sure I support the president's policies on it." Q: "But you would agree that condoms do stop the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Would you say: 'No, we're not going to distribute them,' knowing that?" McCain: (Twelve-second pause) "Get me Coburn's thing, ask Weaver to get me Coburn's paper that he just gave me in the last couple of days. I've never gotten into these issues before." So yes, McCain said he was "stumped" when asked whether he thinks contraceptives help stop the spread of HIV. This is one truth-telling condom.

pomt-10100	"One percent of the American people make over 21 percent of all the income in America. That wasn’t the way before George Bush became president."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/27/joe-biden/the-rich-are-in-fact-getting-richer/	In an interview making the rounds on the Internet due to its, let’s say, aggressive tone of questioning, Barbara West of WFTV in Orlando grilled Sen. Joe Biden about Sen. Barack Obama’s tax plan and at one point cited Karl Marx to ask whether Obama’s plan to "spread the wealth around" amounted to Marxism. She also asked this doozy: "Sen. Obama now famously told Joe the Plumber he wanted to spread his wealth around. A Gallup poll showed 84 percent of Americans prefer government focus on improving economic conditions and creating more jobs in the U.S. as opposed to taking steps to distribute wealth. Isn’t Sen. Obama’s comment a potentially crushing political blunder?" "Absolutely not," Biden answered. "The only person who has spread the wealth around has been George Bush and John McCain’s tax policy. They have devastated the middle class. ... For the first time since the late 20s, 1 percent of the American people make over 21 percent of all the income in America. That wasn’t the way before George Bush became president." In highlighting the growing income disparity for the very wealthy, Biden is citing an analysis of U.S. tax returns published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2005. Updated versions of the report show that in 2006 (the most recently available year) the top 1 percent made 22.8 percent of all the income in the United States. And Biden is correct that it hasn’t been that high since 1928. End of story? Not quite. When Biden says "that wasn’t the way before George Bush became president," some context is in order. The increase became evident long before Bush took office. In 2000, the year Bush won election, the top 1 percent made about 21.5 percent of all the income in the United States. So, 21.5 in 2000 to 22.8 in 2006. An increase, but not huge. And the percentage of income captured by the top 1 percent has risen steadily since the 1970s (when it hovered around 9 percent) and through several presidencies. It began to soar in the 1980s, and reached new heights and grew more quickly during the 1990s administration of Bill Clinton, a Democrat. The number dropped in the early 2000s with the burst of the dot.com bubble, and then steadily increased until 2006. So while some of Bush’s policies have favored the rich, economists say it is not fair for Biden to lay the entire rising income gap at Bush’s feet. "The big picture is that we have seen dramatic increases (in the percentage of income for the top 1 percent) over the last couple decades," said Emmanuel Saez, professor of economics at University of California and a co-author of the study. Saez thinks more attention is being focused on the figures now because during the Clinton administration expansion, the bottom 99 percent captured more than half the growth. During the Bush expansion, real incomes for the bottom 99 percent remained fairly stagnant, while the top 1 percent captured 73 percent of the growth. Bottom line, says Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, the bottom 99 percent fared better under the Clinton administration than they did under Bush. Under Clinton, the very rich got richer, as they have under Bush. The difference is that under Clinton, the average salary for the bottom 99 percent increased from $35,500 to nearly $42,000; while under Bush the average salary for the bottom 99 percent has actually gone down $1,100. Economists point to several reasons for the growth in disparity between the very rich and everyone else, including the decline of labor unions, the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs to cheap labor overseas, rising executive pay, and the relative drop of the minimum wage from 1981 to 2007. While goods and services became more expensive, the minimum wage stayed the same. Bush has, however, exacerbated the after-tax income inequality with tax cuts that disproportionately help the rich, economists said. He also has resisted congressional attempts to cut costs for the working poor, such as by opposing an expansion of a popular children’s health insurance program that he says helps some who don’t need it. Biden cites the number accurately for the amount of income captured by the top 1 percent, and he’s technically right when he says "that wasn’t the way before George Bush became president." It went from 21.5 to 22.8. We allow that there is a more stark difference in how well the lower 99 percent fared, which backs up Biden's overall point about income disparity growing under Bush. It has, some. But the percent of income caputured by the top 1 percent has risen fairly steadily for decades, and we think it's misleading for Biden to suggest this disparity didn't exist before Bush. And so we only give him a Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-10-27T00:00:00	2008-10-23	['United_States', 'George_W._Bush']

"CNN to permanently close its doors as ratings plunge 30 percent," said a May 18 headline on Your News Wire. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. Your News Wire, a website that often posts misleading and fake news, repeated information from the conservative website Breitbart, which celebrated a recent drop in CNN’s ratings. Your News Wire used real data from Ad Week to show a 29 percent primetime rating drop during the second week of May compared to the same week last year. Then the story declared that as a result of the "nosedive" in ratings "the failing news network may be about to come to an abrupt end." The story included a photo of what appears to be a CNN studio going up in flames but had no evidence that the network has shut down or plans to do so. CNN spokespersons didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. While a ratings drop or spike by a network can be used by networks to boast about their position, ratings for a short period of time don’t reveal much about a network’s viability. Networks sell ads on longer-term data, so a drop in ratings over a couple of weeks may not mean much. Ratings also must be examined based on news events during the time period in question -- it's built into the business model that some news weeks are slower than others. For example, during the week of May 8-14, 2017, President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified to a Senate panel about Michael Flynn, a former Trump adviser, in the Russia saga. The idea that CNN would shut down is a bit of a fantasy for conservatives who share Trump’s allegation that the network is "fake news." While Trump uses the term "fake news" to describe news coverage that is unsympathetic to his administration and his performance, at PolitiFact we refer to fake news as fabricated content that intentionally masquerades as news coverage of actual events. Statements by Trump have been named PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year award twice. Your News Wire said in a headline "CNN to permanently close its doors as ratings plunge 30 percent." While the ratings drop during the second week of May compared to a year ago is real, the conclusion that CNN is going out of business is nonsense. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10039	"The Congressional Budget Office has found that (the stimulus) bill will lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product by 2019."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/23/mark-sanford/sanford-distorts-impact-stimulus-bill/	A week after the economic stimulus bill was signed into law, it continues to come under fire from Republicans who say it won't do enough to jump-start the economy. In an op-ed in the Washington Post on Feb. 23, Mark Sanford, the Republican governor of South Carolina, wrote that the bill would not only fail to boost the economy, but that it would actually make things worse. "Now that the so-called stimulus plan is law, we're left with one question: Will this package help us or hurt us? Unfortunately, I believe it is the latter, for a few reasons," wrote Sanford. "First, this package will ultimately mean less, not more, economic activity. The Congressional Budget Office has found that this bill will lead to a real 0.1 to 0.3 percent reduction in gross domestic product by 2019. That translates into our economy losing tens of billions of dollars." When we asked Sanford's communications director to provide the source for his data, he pointed us to a Feb. 4 letter from CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf to senators and House members that projects the impact of the stimulus bill. We should note that the CBO is a nonpartisan agency that has the thankless task of projecting the cost and impact of bills being considered by Congress. CBO does not take a position on legislation and its estimates are widely quoted (and occasionally, misquoted) by both parties. The Feb. 4 letter that Sanford cites is about the Senate version of the stimulus bill. It gives an overview of CBO's estimates. (It's worth noting that there is a newer estimate written Feb. 11 that has slightly different numbers, but the patterns are the same. And CBO is likely to update that estimate in the near future.) The letter says, in the cautious language of government economists, that the stimulus bill would indeed stimulate the economy. It says that the Senate version of the bill would boost GDP — the key measurement of the economy's output — by 1.2 percent to 3.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010. The bill would add 1.3 million to 3.9 million jobs. And it would reduce the unemployment rate 0.7 percentage points to 2.1 percentage points below the baseline forecast of 8.7 percent. The letter says that the stimulus, intended as a short-term program to get the economy moving again, would have short-term effects. So if the letter shows the stimulus bill will boost the economy, how can Sanford claim there is a decline in 2019? He's quoting a single number out of context and distorting what it means. His office pointed us to a section of the letter that discusses the long-term impact. It says that by 2019 the Senate legislation "would reduce GDP by 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent on net." That's not worded very clearly and it has led many people — including many conservative critics — to misunderstand what CBO meant. Bill Beach, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that was referring to the long-term impact of the debt from the stimulus bill on the economy. CBO estimates that all of the debt from the stimulus could have effect of "crowding out" private investment, meaning that investors wouldn't put as much of their money into private capital, which has an negative impact on the economy. But the effect is relatively small. It would lower the GDP from its "baseline" level by only 0.1 to 0.3 percent. And contrary to the way Sanford said it, the economy is still growing by 2.5 percent annually at that point, according to CBO. It's just wouldn't grow as fast because of the big debt. Sanford is quoting the number out of context and neglecting to point out that it is a reduction from the baseline, which itself was going up. So he gives the impression it is a decline in the real GDP, when it's really a decline in GDP growth. Big difference. To say Sanford is cherry-picking the letter would be too generous. He has taken one number from a letter that seems to support his thesis and distorted it. And he's ignored several more prominent measurements that show the stimulus bill would help the economy. So we find his claim to be False.	None	Mark Sanford	None	None	None	2009-02-23T16:36:59	2009-02-23	['None']
pomt-05892	"No candidate has run more negative ads in American history than Barack Obama did in 2008, especially in the general.’’	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-no-candidate-has-run-more-negative-ads/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spoke to CNN on the state's primary day and predicted that the winner of Florida -- which turned out to be Mitt Romney -- would likely be the nominee of the Republican Party. On CNN, Rubio was asked about the many negative ads that ran during the campaign and if it was a preview of what was to come in the general election. "I think that's been a part of every campaign," Rubio said. "Unfortunately, it's only gotten worse. No candidate in American history has ever run more negative ads than Barack Obama. I don't think that will change in 2012. Unfortunately people have to get used to it. I think voters see through that." Did Obama earn the mantle of running the most negative ads in American history? Detailed data on campaign advertising has been kept since the 1996 founding of Campaign Media Analysis Group, which is part of Kantar Media, said Erika Franklin Fowler, assistant professor of government at Wesleyan University and co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. The predecessor to the Wesleyan Media Project, the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project, did an analysis of that data for the 2008 campaign. The 2008 presidential campaign set a record for political ads; television ads totaled nearly $600 million. Combined, the candidates aired more than 1.1 million campaign ads. Obama aired 141,541 spots and spent more than $74 million on television ads during the Democratic primary. During the Republican primary, McCain aired 19,581 ads at the cost of approximately $12 million. These are figures for candidates’ spending -- not that of other groups. Between June and election day, Obama far outspent McCain: Obama spent more than $226 million to McCain’s expenditure of over $162 million. Obama aired more than 436,000 ads, while McCain aired 337,000 ads. The report concluded that Obama bought significantly more ads, but that more of McCain's ads were negative. "During the final presidential debate Sen. John McCain argued that Obama had ‘spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history,’ while Barack Obama accused Sen. McCain of running an entirely negative campaign," the report said. "In a way, both candidates were correct. .... At certain points in the campaign Barack Obama aired nearly as many negative or contrast ads as John McCain aired altogether. As a proportion, however, it is clear that most of McCain’s ads were negative in tone." The Washington Post’s The Fact Checker examined the same claim and cited a study by University of Missouri professor William Benoit who is now a professor at Ohio University. We also spoke to Benoit. "It is true (Obama) ran more negative ads or ran them more often than McCain, but if you look at the content of the ads to see what they were saying, it was really about the same,’’ in terms of what percentage were negative, Benoit said. Benoit said he examined specific negative and positive statements in TV ads by the campaigns. One ad could have both negative and positive statements. During the primary election, 19 percent of the statements he examined in McCain ads were negative, while for Obama 20 percent of statements were negative. During the general election, Benoit found that 68 percent of the statements in Obama’s ads were attacks while McCain’s were 62 percent attacks. (Benoit did a separate analysis of Obama’s 30-minute ad near the end of the campaign and found that only 18 percent of the statements were attacks as Obama tried to end on a mostly positive note.) Benoit said that the difference in the general election in terms of percentages wasn’t significant, concluding that about two-thirds of both campaigns' statements in the general election were attacks. Benoit said he has analyzed TV ads back to 1952, and the only campaign that came close to that was Dwight Eisenhower’s 1952 campaign -- 69 percent of his statements were negative. "Obama and a Republican -- Eisenhower -- are about virtually tied," Benoit said. "Eisenhower had one percentage point more." Benoit told us that Obama ran more negative ads because he ran many more ads overall, both positive and negative. "He ran more simply because he had more money not because of the tone of the ads he had were more negative. There was no significant difference in the tone of ads both campaigns created," he said. Rubio responds Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told us in an e-mail: "(Obama) spent way more on TV ads than any other campaign in history, and they were predominately negative." Conant also sent a few articles that appeared during the campaign about Obama’s rampant spending including Washington Post article that stated that Obama and Democratic Party committees spent nearly $105 million the first two weeks of October compared to just over $25 million by McCain and Republican entities. Our Ruling Rubio said. "No candidate has run more negative ads in American history than Barack Obama did in 2008, especially in the general.’’ In sheer numbers, that statement is correct: Obama bought many more ads than McCain did, both positive and negative. Nevertheless, two studies suggest that, overall, Obama's ads were not significantly more negative than his rival. He ran the most negative ads because he ran the most ads. We rate Rubio's statement Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2012-02-06T16:44:12	2012-01-31	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-09521	Says the Texas Education Agency follows up to make sure undocumented immigrants paying in-state tuition at Texas colleges are applying for permanent residency.	false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/14/rick-perry/perry-says-tea-checks-whether-undocumented-student/	In 2001, Gov. Rick Perry proudly signed legislation into law allowing illegal immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates. The law lets undocumented students who have graduated from a Texas high school and lived in Texas for at least three years qualify — if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they're able to do so. As of 2008, 22,697 non-U.S. citizens and permanent residents had attended Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates. More than 10,000 were enrolled in fall 2008 — the latest count available. Tuition varies among Texas public colleges and universities, which make their own tuition policies and set their own rates on top of the base tuition set by statute: $50 per semester credit hour at four-year universities for Texas residents and $327 for non-residents. Perry, responding to a reporter's question, recently said that the Texas Education Agency verifies that undocumented students are making good on their sworn promise to apply for permanent residency. We wondered if that was so. During the second GOP gubernatorial debate Jan. 29, Len Cannon, KHOU-TV Houston news anchor, asked Perry: "You pointed out that for illegal immigrants to get the in-state tuition they have to apply for legal residency, correct?" Perry: "Yes, sir." Cannon: "According to the bill it says you have to promise to apply. Does the state then follow up to verify that the application has been made for residency?" Perry: "It is my understanding, yes, sir, absolutely." Cannon: "And what agency?" Perry: "TEA." Twice, Cannon repeated the question, with the same result. He tried again one more time. Cannon: "TEA does that?" Perry: "Yes, sir. Texas Education Agency." Clearly, Perry believes the TEA follows up on public college students who enroll as illegal immigrants. But is it true? Not according to Suzanne Marchman, TEA spokeswoman, who said the agency oversees primary and secondary public education. "The law (at issue) applies to colleges and universities," she said of House Bill 1403, the measure Perry signed in June 2001 permitting undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at higher education institutions. "Our agency doesn't oversee any of that." Catherine Frazier, deputy press secretary at the Perry campaign, immediately conceded the governor's misstatement. Frazier said: "Each university is supposed to follow up on whether undocumented immigrants are pursuing citizenship and report to the (Texas) Higher Education Coordinating Board." That so? Not exactly, at least not at the University of Texas at Austin: "There's no requirement in the law that we follow up on that," said Deana Williams, UT's assistant director of admissions. Williams, a UT admissions official since before the 2001 law took effect, said the coordinating board, which oversees colleges and universities statewide, has told the schools to collect undocumented students' affidavits and check their transcripts to confirm that they've lived in Texas for at least the three years required to be eligible for in-state tuition. Williams said UT keeps the affidavits on record indefinitely but it's "never required to report or check" whether those students are actively pursuing permanent residency . Andy Kesling, the coordinating board's director of communications, said the board doesn't follow up with benefiting students at all. Indeed, there's nothing in the statute requiring it to. Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, carried the legislation in the Senate that had been authored in the House by then-Rep. Rick Noriega. Van de Putte told us: "There's nobody checking, but they technically could — there's nothing prohibiting them from checking and there's nothing that mandates them to check." And while undocumented students can apply for permanent residency, current immigration laws generally preclude them from obtaining a green card without an employer's sponsorship. The DREAM Act, proposed federal legislation that has several times failed to pass Congress, would allow undocumented students to obtain permanent residency after two years of college or military service. "It's almost like a Catch-22," Van de Putte said. "There's so many hoops and barriers. Getting the education is just one part." For the moment, it appears that no state agency checks up on whether students benefiting from HB 1403 pursue permanent residency. We rate both Perry's claim — and his campaign aide's attempted correction — False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-02-14T20:11:51	2010-01-29	['Texas', 'Texas_Education_Agency']
pomt-11954	"White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/06/newsweek/are-white-males-responsible-more-mass-shootings-an/	As details about the Las Vegas shooter’s identity emerged, media outlets noted some of the characteristics fit neatly within a familiar profile of prior mass shooting perpetrators. Newsweek, for instance, ran a story with the headline, "White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group." The article builds on this claim, stating that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white males. We’ve covered the demographics of mass shootings before but had not heard this specific claim. So we decided to take a closer look at who’s behind mass shootings. Tracking mass shootings No U.S. government entity specifically tracks mass shootings — much less, the shooters’ race and ethnicity, experts told us. But some media organizations and nongovernmental groups have taken up the task in various forms. Some of the differences in the datasets are the result of having no universally accepted definition of mass shooting. The number of mass shootings a group tallies can vary dramatically based on how the term is defined. For example, the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that tracks gun-related injuries and deaths, defines a mass shooting as "four or more shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter." According to that group, there have been 274 mass shootings so far this year, or nearly one per day. Another widely cited source comes from the progressive media outlet Mother Jones, which created a database in 2012 after the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater. Mother Jones defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. This language is similar to a 2013 statute that defines "mass killings" as three or more killed in a single incident, though that applies to any weapon. The Mother Jones database, which dates back to Aug. 20, 1982, counts 91 mass shootings. Of these, 50 were carried out by white men — hence, where Newsweek and other outlets got the statistic that 54 percent of mass shootings carried out since 1982 were done so by white men. For comparison’s sake, Mother Jones' data show African-Americans accounted for 15 mass shootings, while Latinos and Asians were responsible for seven each. Three attacks were carried out by women, including one of the two perpetrators behind the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. We should note that some experts expressed concern that if the public debate around gun violence focuses too much on mass shootings, there’s a risk of overlooking the fact that gun murders disproportionately affect minorities, especially African-Americans. Assessing the data Because Newsweek’s claim derives from Mother Jones’ data, we asked experts about the reliability of this count. Grant Duwe, author of Mass Murder in the United States: A History, considered a leading scholarly book on the subject, has long criticized Mother Jones’ accounting. Duwe pointed us to an essay he penned for Reason magazine in 2014, in which he argued Mother Jones has low-balled its tally of mass shootings as a result of relying solely on news coverage as its source of data. Duwe believes this creates a false impression that mass shootings have been on the rise (a claim that’s beyond the scope of this fact-check). "The main concern is an underreporting problem that gets worse the farther back in time we go," Duwe told PolitiFact. "This creates problems when it comes to drawing conclusions about trends in the prevalence of mass public shootings." Nevertheless, Duwe said his own research dating back to 1900 corroborates that white men have committed more mass shootings than any other group, though he believes white men make up an even larger share than the Mother Jones data show. "There have been at least 184 mass public shootings in the U.S. since 1900, including the Las Vegas attack," Duwe said. "Among these mass public shooters, non-Hispanic whites make up 63 percent, which is close to what we see for the U.S. population in general. So, the Mother Jones data actually underreport the extent to which whites are involved as mass public shooters." The vast majority of mass shootings is committed by men. Looking only at the male population, some have argued that statistical claims based on Mother Jones data on the racial makeup of mass shooters leaves out important context. Critics argue that when you consider that non-Hispanic white men make up about 63 percent of the male population, white men appear proportionally less likely to commit a mass shooting, according to the Mother Jones statistics showing white men account for 54 percent of mass shootings. (Duwe’s finding that non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of mass shooters is roughly in line with the white portion of the male population. White men make up roughly 31 percent of the overall U.S. population.) Duwe defines "mass public shooting" as an incident that occurs in the absence of other criminal activity, in which a gun was used to kill four or more victims at a public location within a 24-hour period. Mother Jones national affairs editor Mark Follman praised Duwe’s dataset as valuable, but he pushed back on the notion that they’d underreported attacks, saying that to the best of his recollection some of the shootings Duwe flagged as deserving to be included in Mother Jones' database did not fit their criteria. He also said that while most of Mother Jones’ data is initially culled from media reports, they have also relied on primary source documents, interviews with law enforcement and tips from the public about more obscure cases going back further in time. For more on how the group calculated the frequency of mass shootings, he pointed us to a 2014 Mother Jones article claiming the rate of mass shootings tripled since 2011. Our ruling Newsweek said, "White men have committed more mass shootings than any other group." Newsweek based its claim on data from Mother Jones, which defines a public mass shooting as an incident in which the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing and a lone gunman took the lives of at least three people. Under this definition, Mother Jones found that non-Hispanic white men have been responsible for 54 percent of mass shootings since August 1982. Another tally, with a longer timeline and a different definition of mass shooting, found non-Hispanic white men make up 63 percent of these attacks. Under both definitions and datasets, white men have committed more mass shootings than any other ethnicity group. Newsweek's claim is literally accurate. But it's worth noting the imprecision of this data, and the percentage of mass shootings by white men is lower than their share of the male population, according to Mother Jones.

pomt-09449	"Florida's new fingerprint identification system is improving our rate of solving cold cases by 300 percent."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/08/charlie-crist/new-fingerprint-technology-results-solve-rate-300-/	In the crime portion of his final State of the State speech, Gov. Charlie Crist touted the success of a new technology that he says is helping police close unsolved cases. The technology -- an advanced fingerprint and palm print identification system -- has increased solve rates on cold cases three-fold, Crist said in his 43-minute address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 2, 2010. "Florida's new fingerprint identification system is improving our rate of solving cold cases by 300 percent, benefiting victims hurt by previously unsolved crimes," Crist said. Is this new technology putting that many more bad guys behind bars? The new system Crist is talking about is called the Biometric Identification System, or BIS for short. According to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which manages the new system, BIS is more precise and has more capacity than previous systems. Here's how it works: Law enforcement officials from across the state upload fingerprint and palm print information from crime scenes and from people they arrest. The computer then tries to match the two, looking for people in the system who may have committed unsolved crimes. The concept isn't new -- FDLE has been matching fingerprints electronically for years -- but the state is now able to match palm prints for the first time. The new system also improves accuracy in fingerprint searches, said FDLE spokeswoman Kristen Chernosky. The new statewide BIS system has been up and running since May 2009 and has paid great dividends, Chernosky said. In fact, the FDLE spokeswoman said it was the state law enforcement agency that provided Crist's office the 300 percent figure he cited in his speech. But the number isn't calculating what Crist said it was. "There has been an approximately 300 percent increase in the number of fingerprint hits that have been provided to our local law enforcement agencies," Chernosky said. "That means there was some kind of match, but not necessarily the number of cases solved." Put another way, the new system is increasing the number of fingerprint and palm print matches to aid local law enforcement, but it's yet unclear if those matches are leading to a similar increase in arrests. The FDLE hasn't tracked that number, Chernosky said. Bill Schade, who manages Pinellas County's fingerprint records department, sings the praises of the new system. He said it produced 20 fingerprint hits on cold cases in February 2010, and already has produced a handful of matches in the first week of March. Some hits lead to arrests -- he pointed to one case in Clearwater where a fingerprint match tied a suspect to a string of local burglaries. But many do not, Schade says. A recent example involved a stolen washer and dryer. Forensics investigators were able to get prints at the home where the crime occurred, and eventually, law enforcement officials got a match. But in between the crime and finding a fingerprint match, the washer and dryer were returned to the home. In that case, no one wanted to press charges and the investigation stalled. That's an important distinction in assessing Crist's claim. He said the new technology is "improving our rate of solving cold cases by 300 percent, benefiting victims hurt by previously unsolved crimes." Crist is right that the new BIS system is helping police and sheriff's deputies. But he's making it sound like the new technology is having a dramatic impact on the number of cases solved. In fact, fingerprint matches are up 300 percent, but that doesn't correspond to a similar percentage of additional cases being solved. That data doesn't exist, and system users acknowledge that fingerprint matches don't always lead to arrests. As a result, we rate Crist's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11767	Says the tax bill "is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/30/donald-trump/will-gop-tax-bill-cost-donald-trump-fortune-no/	President Donald Trump said he wouldn’t benefit financially from the Republican tax legislation on Capitol Hill. In fact, he said he would get socked by it. "So right now, America's tax code is a total dysfunctional mess," Trump said in a speech in St. Charles, Mo., on Nov. 29, 2017. "The current system has cost our nation millions of American jobs, trillions and trillions of dollars, and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance. It is riddled with loopholes that let some special interests -- including myself, in all fairness. This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me." Trump’s claim sounded dubious. The analyses of the bills we have seen show advantages, not disadvantages, for the wealthy as well as corporations. When we asked the White House for additional details about how the law would hurt Trump, they cited the repeal of the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers to deduct all or some of their state and local tax burden from their federal taxable income. As a wealthy resident of New York City, Trump would likely face high tax state and local rates. (At the Nov. 30 press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited the elimination of deductions as one possible source of a tax increase for the president.) The White House also cited "anti-abuse" provisions within the changes being made to the "pass-through" tax rates for business income that is taxed within individual tax filings. Trump may indeed get hit by some of the tax bill’s specific provisions. But independent analyses of the bill’s potential impact on his own tax situation agree that, after all is said and done, he should come out far ahead compared to the status quo. It is impossible to pin down the benefits that would flow to Trump's tax situation due to his own refusal to follow the decades-old presidential precedent of releasing his tax returns. (He broke his promise to release them). Any projections depend on a leaked, partial tax return from 12 years ago, and a lot may have changed since then. For instance, there's no way of knowing whether 2005 was an unusual year for Trump’s finances. Analyses by the New York Times and NBC attempted to understand how Trump's finances would be impacted by the House bill rely on the partial 2005 return. The Times based its calculations on a framework that preceded the official release of both chambers’ bills. The NBC analysis was based on the House version of the bill. (The framework is different than the House bill in its details, but they share many common elements.) The elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the lowering of the pass-through tax rate for certain types of business income -- minus tax increases from eliminating many existing deductions -- would leave Trump $42 million better off, according to the New York Times analysis. (The alternative minimum tax requires that taxpayers with many deductions pay at least a minimum amount of taxes.) The NBC analysis — undertaken by Maury Cartine, the partner in charge of tax and business services in the New York City office of the Marcum Group — found net savings of $22.5 million for Trump, primarily from eliminating the alternative minimum tax. Trump’s myriad ventures could enable him to benefit from several changes. The House version would allow "pass-through" business income to be taxed at 25 percent, rather than the current maximum of 39.6 percent. The Senate bill would use a different mechanism for such income that is less advantageous. Trump’s 2005 return showed more than $109 million in income from businesses that would potentially benefit from a tax break on pass-through income. So, at the very least, two independent estimates came up with immediate savings in the low tens of millions of dollars. Even if the actual savings for Trump end up being a small fraction of that amount, that would be more money than most Americans make in a year, and more than some make in a lifetime. Meanwhile, this doesn’t include the potentially massive benefits Trump could see from changes to the estate tax -- albeit savings that would take longer to materialize. The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax. Due to generous exemptions, the tax generally hits wealthy taxpayers. The House bill would end the estate tax after 2024. The Senate bill would keep it, instead doubling the current exemption for individuals to $11 million. The approach that prevails in the final version of the bill is unknown for now. Both the Times and NBC estimated that the House version of the estate tax could save Trump more than $1.1 billion. Neither analysis looked specifically at the Senate’s version; that approach would likely provide Trump with some savings, but on a much smaller scale. (It’s worth noting that any potential savings from the estate tax would come only after the death of Trump or his wife Melania, presumably years down the road.) Trump’s possible gains from the bill are hardly unique for the wealthiest Americans. According to analysis of the Senate bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, American households with incomes in excess of $1 million -- a threshold Trump is almost certainly far above -- would see a tax savings of $41,819 in 2019 and $36,259 in 2017. And an analysis by an independent group, the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, estimated that for the top one-tenth of 1 percent of earners -- those with incomes of at least $3,439,900 -- 72 percent would see tax cuts and 28 would see a tax increase in 2018. The average tax cut for this group would be $174,620 in 2018. Our ruling Trump said, "This (tax bill) is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me. Believe me, this is not good for me." While there is uncertainty about the exact scale of Trump’s potential gains -- both because of the lack of a final version of the bill and because of big gaps in the public knowledge about his personal finances -- either of the GOP bills would almost certainly give Trump a big windfall. Two independent analyses suggest that it could be in the low tens of millions of dollars immediately. His family also could get as much as $1.1 billion over the longer term if the estate tax is fully repealed, as the House bill would do. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07267	The Paul Ryan budget proposal would "privatize Medicare."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/25/agenda-project/throw-granny-cliff-ad-says-paul-ryan-plan-would-pr/	Amid discussion of the Medicare overhaul proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., an ad created by the Agenda Project, a liberal group, cut through the clutter quite dramatically -- though with critics saying it was literally over the top. The ad, set to "America the Beautiful," shows a man pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair toward a scenic overlook. At first, the woman is happy, enjoying the sights. But then the man picks up the pace, veers past warning signs and rushes toward a cliff. When he reaches the edge, he tips over the wheelchair, and the woman falls dramatically over the ledge. The man walks calmly away. The ad contains no dialogue, so its point is made through a series of superimposed statements. "In 1965, Americans made Medicare into Law. Today, Medicare provides the health insurance for 46 million Americans. More than half of Americans on Medicare live on less than $28,000 a year. Now, Republicans want to privatize Medicare. Is America beautiful without Medicare?" We decided to check two claims in this ad. One, which we’ll look at in a different item, is whether the Ryan plan would leave the country "without Medicare." The second, which we’ll investigate here, is whether the Ryan budget proposal would "privatize Medicare." First, we’ll provide a summary of the Ryan plan, which was passed by the House in a near-party-line vote and which has more recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters will not be comfortable with its approach. Ryan’s plan would dramatically cut federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline. One of its major features is dramatically restructuring Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older. Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government, although they would receive "premium support" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money. The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people the same age. The plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provides smaller premium support to high earners. In analyzing the claim that Ryan's plan privatizes Medicare, we see at least three questions to consider, based on our discussions with a range of policy experts: How do you define "privatization"? When we contacted Erica Payne, the founder and president of the Agenda Project, she defended the use of "privatization" by arguing that under the current system, the purchaser is the government and the vendor is the health provider, while under the Ryan plan, the purchaser would be the patient and the vendor would be the insurance company. "Because the choice of vendor is now in the hands of an individual who will in essence ‘shop’ for an insurance plan provided by a private company, this change will have the effect of transforming Medicare into a private insurance system," Payne said. "As such, we conclude that this plan seeks to ‘privatize’ Medicare. Supplanting a government system that pays directly for benefits with a plan that inserts private companies into the exchange of goods and services seems like a fairly standard interpretation of the privatization concept." Is she right? There are actually a number of definitions of privatization, but Steven Berry, a Yale University economist, said that at least one common definition does seem to fit what he calls "Ryancare." In what Berry says is an oft-cited 1988 law journal article, Paul Starr, a liberal professor of sociology and public policy, wrote that one acceptable definition of "privatization" is, "Instead of directly producing some service, the government may finance private services, for example, through contracting-out or vouchers." While the Congressional Budget Office has followed Ryan’s lead in calling the subsidies "premium supports" rather than "vouchers," Berry said the definition still applies. "The Ryan plan takes some functions the government currently provides and transfers these to private sector insurance companies, providing a government subsidy to pay for the private sector services," he said. "Ryan is clear about this -- he thinks the private sector will do a better job in these activities as opposed to the ‘monopoly’ government agency. This is a traditional argument in favor of this kind of privatization." Is Medicare fully public now? In many important ways, Medicare is a public program today. Payments to doctors are made with government money, collected through mandatory tax assessments. There’s a large bureaucracy called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that sets standards for the program and carries out enforcement. But Robert Moffitt, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, points out that Medicare -- despite its reputation as an exemplar of single-payer health care -- has some noteworthy aspects that are more accurately considered private. "The entire Medicare delivery system -- doctors, hospitals, home health care agencies, nursing homes, hospice care facilities -- are almost all private agents or institutions," Moffitt said. "Exceptions would include county or public hospitals that are reimbursed for treating Medicare patients." In addition, most Medicare enrollees have supplemental insurance to cover costs the program doesn't, and most of this supplemental coverage is either bought on the private market or secured through employers. The Medicare Advantage program, which accounts for roughly a quarter of Medicare enrollees, is run by private insurers using Medicare funds. About 60 percent of seniors are enrolled in private drug plans in the Medicare Part D Program. Finally, the federal government already administers Medicare through private contractors, usually large private insurance carriers that process Medicare claims. So while the Ryan plan would shift the needle further toward the private sector than it is today, it’s important to remember that Medicare today is not simply a government program without a private-sector role. How much of a government role would remain under the Ryan plan? Ryan’s spokesman, Conor Sweeney, emphasizes that under the proposal, Medicare will retain significant government aspects. "The government continues to collect payroll taxes to fund Medicare for future seniors," Sweeney said. "It provides financial support to guarantee that future seniors are covered. And it tightly regulates the plans among which future seniors get to choose, so that they are protected from discriminatory pricing. Under our plan, Medicare remains a government program dedicated to help fulfill the health security for America’s seniors. The real question on Medicare is not whether government should be involved, it is how much power should the government have over individual health care decisions?" Several economists with experience in privatization issues told us there’s enough evidence to call the Ryan proposal a privatization plan. "I would have to say that (privatization) is a correct characterization of the plan's operation," said Ellen Dannin, a Penn State law professor. "It isn't private in the sense that a mom-and-pop store is private but, rather, it would operate more or less as a regulated and heavily subsidized private industry. Because someone reaching the age for enrollment in Medicare after the bill's threshhold date would have no ability to enroll in Medicare (as currently structured), their best and only option seems likely to be taking the plan's payment and enrolling in a private plan provided by an insurance company." Roger Noll, a Stanford University economist, said that the Ryan plan would clearly shift the duties for paying expenses from a federal agency to a private insurance company. The act of the government providing regulatory oversight, he said, isn’t the same as the government providing a service. Noll added that confusion on this issue may stem from an imprecise understanding of how Medicare actually works. "Health care and insurance are separate services," he said. "Medicare always has relied on privatized health care. What's being privatized in the Ryan plan is health insurance services." So where does this leave us? It’s true that under the Ryan proposal, the government will retain important duties in running Medicare. But "privatization" does not have to mean that the government has nothing further to do with the enterprise. Under longstanding definitions, privatization could take place without the government giving up its right to regulate a privately provided service, such as an electric utility. That said, we think it’s fair to note that Medicare already provides some types of coverage through private insurance now, so the shift toward the private sector prompted by the Ryan plan would be more a question of degree than kind. On balance, we conclude that the idea that the Paul Ryan budget proposal would "privatize Medicare" is Mostly True.

pomt-09108	"We have a director of homeland security who cannot use and will not use the term 'terrorist attack' but instead substitutes 'man-made disaster.' "	false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/21/jerry-patterson/patterson-says-napolitano-wont-say-terrorist-attac/	Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson fired up the crowd during a speech at the state GOP convention June 11 by declaring that “we’re besieged today by political correctness.” To illustrate his point, he singled out Janet Napolitano, the former Arizona governor who joined President Barack Obama’s Cabinet. “We have a director of homeland security who cannot use and will not use the term ‘terrorist attack’ but instead substitutes ‘man-made disaster,’ ” Patterson said. Has the leader of an agency charged with keeping the United States safe indeed scrubbed “terrorist attack” from her vocabulary? When we contacted Patterson, he pointed us to congressional testimony that Napolitano gave in early 2009 and media accounts of the criticism that followed. On Feb. 25, 2009, Napolitano made her debut appearance before the House Homeland Security Committee. Before delivering her prepared statement, the committee’s ranking Republican, Peter King, R-N.Y., noted correctly that the word “terrorism” did not appear in the text of her remarks. King said that he was “not trying to get into semantics on this” but that “it’s important for us in positions of leadership to constantly remind people how real that (terrorism) threat is … and if we don’t do it, it’s going to be hard for us to get legislative support for the measures that we think have to be taken.” In an aside to King as she addressed the committee, Napolitano then invoked the “T” word to describe the agency’s mission: “to confront and prepare for threats that face this nation, be they man-caused -- and terrorism, Rep. King, I believe falls into that category and is central to that category -- or be they caused by nature.” The phrase “man-caused” deviated from Napolitano’s prepared text, which used “man-made” instead. The first instance we found of Napolitano pairing the man-made concept with “disaster” occurred a month earlier, in remarks prepared for her Senate confirmation hearing. Republicans, conservative commentators and other critics pointed to Napolitano’s word choice as evidence that the Obama administration was tip-toeing around the threat of terrorism. Patterson told us that he sees it as “some kind of reluctance to use words that others may take offense at even if those terms are accurate and truthful.” Napolitano was asked about her terminology in March 2009 by a German news magazine, Der Spiegel. Using the term “man-caused disasters,” she replied, “demonstrates that we want to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur." In April 2009 remarks to an Anti-Defamation League conference, Napolitano offered further explanation for her use of “man-caused disaster.” She said that “so often we think of terrorism and the mindset is just al Qaeda … But it is not the only such group, and so to use a different phrase is an effort to cause people to think more broadly about what we are dealing with, and that is those who seek to commit violence to impact broader societies through their economies, through the exercise of their freedoms, and the like.” In early 2010, a writer for The New York Times cast the dust-up over Napolitano’s language as an example of how the Obama administration has rejected some of the Bush administration’s terrorism-related rhetoric (such as Bush references to “evildoers” and “Islamo-fascist”). So Napolitano says she’s trying to expand the public’s thinking about the kinds of threats the U.S. faces. Does that mean she cannot and will not say “terrorist attack,” as Patterson claims? It doesn’t look that way. During her January 2009 confirmation hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Napolitano spoke the word “terrorism” five times and “terrorist” once; we counted. In March 2009, at a conference in Kansas City, Mo., she employed “terrorist attack” in response to a question about the role of the private sector in so-called “fusion centers” enabling law enforcement agencies to analyze and share intelligence information. And in a July 2009 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, Napolitano used “terrorist attack” twice and “terror attack” once. An example: “Make no mistake, Americans continue to be targeted in terror attacks,” Napolitano said. “Just two weeks ago, American hotels were the target of bombings in Jakarta that killed eight people and injured six Americans.” More recently, Napolitano told CNN on May 2, 2010 – the day after a sport-utility vehicle holding a bomb was found in New York’s Times Square – that the incident was being treated “as if it could be a potential terrorist attack.” And on Friday, Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department, said: “The secretary speaks publicly about terrorism often, including in a speech less than 90 minutes ago to the American Constitution Society.” Patterson said Friday that Napolitano’s continued use of “man-made disaster” proves his point. We disagree. The essence of his charge at the convention was that the secretary can’t and won’t say “terrorist attack.” News accounts, congressional testimony and speeches prove otherwise. We rate Patterson’s statement as False.	None	Jerry Patterson	None	None	None	2010-06-21T06:00:00	2010-06-11	['None']
pomt-03527	A bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline "is an earmark" under House rules.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/31/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-bill-clearing-way-keystone-xl-pi/	Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., recently took an unusual approach to opposing the Keystone XL pipeline, a 1,700-mile project to bring heavy crude from Canada’s oil-rich tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico. He says it’s an earmark, and earmarks aren’t in line with current House rules. "The Keystone XL Pipeline deal is an earmark to a foreign corporation, plain and simple," Grayson said in a news release. "House Republicans claim to have been incredibly keen on ridding our legislative system of congressional earmarks — yet here they are — hypocritically sneaking one in for a foreign corporation. They seem to believe that the ‘no earmarks’ rule does not apply to them. That’s just unacceptable." For years, environmentalists have battled pipeline supporters over the construction of the new pipeline. This year, supporters turned to the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives to essentially waive a variety of regulatory hurdles that have so far delayed the project’s groundbreaking. A bill, H.R. 3, would effectively sidestep the key governmental reviews delaying the project, which is to be built by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P., a Canadian company. H.R. 3 declares that a presidential permit is not required to advance the project. It also clears the project under the the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, among other laws; and prevents the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator from blocking the project. On May 21, 2013, as H.R. 3 was moving toward a vote in the House, Grayson wrote a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in which he argued that the bill was an earmark. We were intrigued by Grayson’s argument and wanted to look in detail at whether the Keystone project fit the definition of an earmark. What is an earmark? Generally speaking, an earmark is a requirement that money approved by Congress be spent in a specific way at the request of a lawmaker. Critics say earmarks serve the interest of a particular congressional district or constituent group rather than the national good. That's why congressional Republicans -- and President Barack Obama -- have promised to curb their use, with some degree of success. To make his case that H.R. 3 was an earmark, Grayson pointed to the section of the House’s rules that define what constitutes an earmark. House rules are written by the chamber’s majority party every two years and approved, typically on a party-line vote, when a new Congress is sworn in. House rules do not have the force of law, but they are binding for the procedures used in the chamber. The current version of the House rules says earmarks are a specific authorization of spending, targeted to a specific purpose or place, and made without a competitive award process. Here’s the exact definition: "For the purpose of this clause, the term ‘congressional earmark’ means a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process." To sharpen his case to Boehner, Grayson streamlined this language by removing some of the extra words. Grayson’s shortened earmark definition was: "a provision … included primarily at the request of a Member ... providing (or) authorizing … a .. grant ... to an entity … other than through a statutory or administrative … or competitive award process." H.R. 3, Grayson wrote, provides a special benefit, "outside of established statutory, administrative or competitive award processes, and it does so to only one entity -- explicitly named in this bill, ‘TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P.’" Grayson went on to argue that the "requirement that this provision be included ‘primarily at the request of a Member’ is surely satisfied by the act of a Member drafting and offering this bill. It was the conscious choice of a Member from the state of Nebraska to offer this legislation, as well as explicitly mention Nebraska or Nebraskans six separate times, while no other state receives a single mention." We checked with several experts on House procedure to see what they thought of Grayson’s argument. They were not convinced. They said their concerns go beyond H.R. 3’s superficial differences with classic earmarks, though it has some of those, too. Typically, earmarks are narrow provisions of larger bills inserted and supported by a small number of lawmakers and advancing a highly localized purpose, such as a local road or construction project. By contrast, H.R. 3 is a stand-alone bill, it has been co-sponsored by 134 House members and it would clear the way for a project that runs from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico. But the more important problem, the experts said, is that the bill does not affect federal spending -- something the House rule explicitly requires. Grayson, they said, got around this by dropping most of the following clause from his streamlined definition: "providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority." Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee who currently directs the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, cited the Congressional Budget Office in arguing that H.R. 3 "comes nowhere near being an earmark as defined by House rules, period." When CBO -- Congress’ nonpartisan fiscal-analysis arm -- weighed the bill’s fiscal impact, it found that "implementing H.R. 3 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information from affected agencies, CBO estimates that the proposed changes to administrative procedures would not significantly affect federal spending for such activities relative to current law. The bill would not affect direct spending or revenues." Roy T. Meyers, political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who has studied budgeting and earmarks, said he was "astonished to see how (Grayson) selectively and misleadingly edited the definition of earmark, then compounded the fault by drawing a bizarre inference regarding the bill's effective approval of a permit. This bill is about administrative regulation, or more accurately, the lack of it. The earmark definition restricts its application to spending, and lists different types of spending, including grants. Grayson cuts the words on spending and the other types of spending besides grants and replaces these missing words with ellipses, which completely changes the meaning." Two other experts -- Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, and Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist -- agreed with this analysis. "There has to be a dollar figure associated with the provision, and this bill does not have that," Ellis said. Grayson’s office stands by its classification of the bill as an earmark, arguing that the House voted on a measure that amounts to a special favor to one entity, for one project, and that was requested by a Member of Congress, Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb. Despite Meyers’ deep skepticism of Grayson’s claim that the bill is an earmark under House rules, he said Grayson has a point. "Earmarks have been criticized, often justifiably, for not being subject to sufficient scrutiny on their policy merits," Myers said. "Unlike most research grants that are subject to demanding peer reviews, or many contracts that must undergo extensive agency review and competitive bidding, earmarks are awarded only after cursory reviews, typically by committee staff. Congress substitutes its judgment on a particular case, cutting agencies and other experts out of the loop." The similarity here, Meyers said, is that the bill prevents agencies from doing their job -- to assess the impacts of a proposed project. Still, that’s not the same thing as arguing that H.R. 3 actually qualifies as an earmark under House rules. "Grayson would be smarter to argue that the bill violates the spirit, not the letter, of the earmark moratorium and the philosophy that supposedly backs it," Meyers said. We should note that the House -- the only body that can officially determine whether a bill fits the earmark definition under the chamber’s rules -- has not passed judgment on Grayson’s claim. When Grayson raised his argument on the House floor, the lawmaker chairing the proceedings ruled that Grayson’s request was improper, dismissing it before allowing any discussion of the substance of Grayson’s complaint. Grayson’s office added that they have not received ruling determination on the merits of his arguments from the House parliamentarian’s office. This result is not surprising. Grayson wasn’t going into court to argue to an impartial judge; in the House, whichever party happens to be in the majority controls the chamber to a near-dictatorial degree. And to nobody’s surprise, the measure passed by a 241-175 margin when it came to a vote on May 22, 2013. No Republican broke ranks by opposing it, while 19 Democrats sided with the majority in supporting the bill. Because the Democratic-controlled Senate is unlikely to agree, the bill is not expected to become law. Our ruling Grayson said a bill to advance the Keystone XL Pipeline "is an earmark" under House rules. Officially, the House -- the only entity that can make this ruling -- has not rendered a judgment on Grayson’s claim. But several experts on earmarks that we checked with were unanimous that Grayson was wrong by the clear language of the rule. The House’s definition of "earmark" is based on the notion that the provision in question spends federal money, which the bill in question does not -- a difference that Grayson carefully edited out when he made his argument to Boehner. We rate Grayson’s claim False.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2013-05-31T15:14:17	2013-05-21	['None']
pomt-13088	"Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military" ... "When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers?"	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/nov/07/ohio-republican-party/gop-mailer-uses-tricky-wording-smear-oh-candidate-/	A PolitiFact Ohio reader suggested that we look into claims found on a mailer that appears to question the patriotism of Democratic House District 37 candidate Casey Weinstein. So we obliged. "Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military," reads one side of the flier, which was paid for by the Ohio Republican Party. On the opposite side: "Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers? Vote no on Casey Weinstein." We wanted to know more about the story behind this claim, so we reached out to the Ohio Republican Party. Though the flier literally reads, "Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military," Ohio’s GOP spokesperson Brittany Warner told PolitiFact Ohio, "Under no circumstances is this written to imply that Mr. Weinstein has no faith in the service of our men and women in uniform." The candidate’s military background makes the words in this ad all the more puzzling. Weinstein, 34, is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo. He is an Air Force Reserve captain currently separated from active duty. His father, his brother, and his wife are also graduates. Confused? Turns out, "no faith in our military" is a paraphrase of Weinstein’s stance in a 2004 lawsuit against the Air Force Academy. The lawsuit asked for renewed enforcement of the constitutional separation of church and state on the military campus. The lawsuit was filed by Weinstein’s father, Mikey Weinstein, a former Air Force officer. Four cadets at the Air Force Academy, including the candidate Casey Weinstein, joined the suit, and claimed that the Air Force Academy imposed a hostile environment by pushing Christianity on the non-Christians in their ranks. One of the incidents detailed in the suit was an Air Force Academy-promoted screening of Mel Gibson’s film, The Passion of the Christ. (Weinstein is Jewish, and Gibson’s movie has been criticized for portraying Jews as enthusiastic participants in the crucifixion of Jesus.) The movie screening was not the plaintiffs’ only example of pervasive religious activities occurring on duty. We contacted Mikey Weinstein, who wanted to be clear that his participation in this fact-check is not an endorsement of his son nor an opinion on the race. The elder Weinstein is the founder and president of the nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation, dedicated to restoring "the obliterated wall separating church and state in the most technologically lethal organization ever created by humankind: the United States armed forces." He is a 1977 graduate of the Air Force Academy who went on to serve for ten years in the Judge Advocate General Corps (as a "JAG" officer), and as legal counsel to President Ronald Reagan's administration in the White House. Mikey Weinstein pointed out that the campaign flier gets the "sued our soldiers" claim wrong on two points. First, it implies that the suit targeted individuals for their individual acts, which is not accurate. A lawsuit filed against a military branch and its highest civil servant -- in this case, the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force -- is an action against the institution, not the individual. Secondly, the servicemembers of the U.S. Air Force are referred to as airmen and airwomen, not soldiers. "Soldiers" applies to members of the Army. Mikey Weinstein said that his organization has represented over 48,000 service members across every branch of the military and any faith (or lack thereof). As for the lawsuit against the U.S. Air Force, it was dismissed by a federal judge after Weinstein and his co-plaintiffs graduated, losing their legal standing against the institution. An internal Air Force investigation later substantiated the claims brought by the Weinsteins’ lawsuit and prompted the issuance of new religious tolerance policies. Our ruling A GOP-funded campaign flier stated, "Casey Weinstein: No faith in our military," and, "When some of our cadets wanted to watch a religious film, Casey Weinstein sued the U.S. military. Sued our soldiers? Vote no on Casey Weinstein." The mailer twists many facts about a lawsuit to present Weinstein, an Air Force reservist from a military family, as hostile to the armed forces. There is an element of truth in that Weinstein did sue the Air Force Academy, asserting that the institution unconstitutionally promoted the evangelization of Christianity by its leadership and cadets on duty. His lawsuit did not target fellow "soldiers," but the institution itself (also, Air Force members are not called "soldiers"). The flier further capitalizes on the two possible interpretations suggested by the phrase "no faith in our military." A cursory read of the flier could easily leave voters with the impression that Weinstein was critical of the armed forces. For manipulating the real narrative, we rate the claims in the mailer Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4264508e-222a-4309-9db5-ccf92962ff8b	None	Ohio Republican Party	None	None	None	2016-11-07T13:44:35	2016-10-28	['United_States']
pomt-08425	Says Russ Feingold supported a stimulus plan that allowed a company to create 3,000 jobs in China.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/19/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-russ-feingold-supported-stimulus-/	Stung by a TV ad from Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold portraying him as anti-worker for supporting foreign trade deals, Republican challenger Ron Johnson is striking back. In a new TV ad, Johnson tries to tarnish Feingold’s pro-labor credentials by casting him as a desperate hypocrite on trade. Where Feingold has touted his opposition to what he calls unfair trade deals with China, Mexico and other countries, the Johnson ad links Feingold to job creation in China -- not through trade deals, but his vote on the 2009 stimulus package. The Johnson ad begins with a narrator saying: "Russ Feingold ... desperate ... running a misleading, negative campaign." The video pans across headlines from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about PolitiFact Wisconsin items that rated past Feingold claims as Half True and Pants on Fire. Then it turns to trade. "Feingold says one thing, does another," the ad’s narrator charges. "Feingold voted the party line for the stimulus bill that allowed U.S. tax dollars to go to foreign companies to create manufacturing jobs overseas." A large graphic then pops up and lingers -- "Create 3,000 jobs in China" -- as the narrators says: "Democrat senators said the bill will create 3,000 jobs in China alone." So by supporting the stimulus bill, did Feingold sell out his stance on trade and pay for 3,000 jobs in China? That’s a big charge. Let’s dig in. While there is no question Feingold supported the stimulus bill, the ad’s claims turn on whether the measure supports overseas jobs in general, and the jobs in China specifically. With the China reference, the ad echoes spots by various congressional candidates across the country that -- according to an Oct. 9, 2010 New York Times article -- play on fears about China’s economic ascendancy. As backup, the Johnson campaign cites two sources: a March 3, 2010 press release by Democratic senators, including Charles Schumer of New York, and a story the same day by Politico that picked up on the press release. The controversy arose after a report by the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University found that overseas firms had received 79 percent of $2.1 billion in renewable-energy grants under the stimulus plan, as PolitiFact National later recounted. That $2.1 billion piece is a tiny portion -- not even 1 percent -- of the overall $787 billion stimulus deal. Only U.S. energy projects can be funded under the stimulus plan, but overseas companies were ahead of America on wind-turbine production, so many of those projects are being developed by the American subsidiaries of foreign companies, PolitiFact National has reported. This detail is glossed over in the ad, which suggests the stimulus money is primarily aimed at creating jobs overseas. The Investigative Reporting Workshop report included reference to a west Texas wind farm proposal that would use made-in-China wind turbines, which would potentially create up to 3,000 jobs in China. That prompted Schumer and the other Democrats to condemn that prospect in a news release. The release described the Texas project as "on the verge" of receiving $450 million in stimulus funds. That release overstated the case. News accounts at the time quoted project officials in the U.S.-China joint venture as saying they would apply for stimulus funding, and the China jobs would total 2,400 to 3,000 jobs, with a much smaller number created in the United States. But much has changed since fall 2009, when the project was announced. The outcry over the investigation led to negotiations between the U.S. Steelworkers union and the U.S.-China joint venture. In March 2010, the project announced that its Chinese manufacturing partner would build turbines at a plant in Nevada, creating up to 300 jobs there. The plant, which will have other manufacturing uses, could create a total of 1,000 jobs, project officials estimated. In August, 2010, the United Steelworkers announced a deal with the wind-farm partners that they say will assure that major components for the project will be made in the United States. According to United Steelworkers national spokesman Wayne Ranick, under the deal, a total of 1,000 U.S. jobs could be created by establishing a domestic supply chain for the project. Wind machines require hundreds of parts and even when key parts are made overseas, much of the work can be done domestically, renewable energy officials say. Project officials now say that a minimum of 70 percent of each wind turbine, including the massive towers and blades, will be wholly manufactured in the United States and made of American steel. Project officials no longer put an estimate on the Chinese manufacturing jobs, saying that the "vast majority" of all jobs created by the wind farm will be in the United States. Finally, the Texas project, which is in its early stages, has not applied for or received any stimulus funding to date, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. They are eligible to do so, however, and have not ruled out applying later. In any case, the Johnson ad twists the reality of the Democratic news release it cites. The senators were opposed to the prospect of the jobs going to China. The Johnson ad presents their statement as some sort of virtue of the Democratic-backed stimulus plan. The ad also leaves a false impression of Feingold’s views on Buy American provisions, including in relation to the stimulus, and on trade with China. Feingold is a longtime advocate of Buy American provisions. In the stimulus debate, it was largely Republicans and business groups, as well as multinational companies and U.S. trading partners, who objected to including strict Buy American rules they viewed as overly protectionist. Feingold voted against a Republican amendment that would have killed the Buy American provision in its entirety, roll call records show. He did support the compromise version that survived. In the Senate, Feingold has voted consistently against foreign trade agreements he deems as damaging to Wisconsin jobs because he believes they favor foreign competitors. This includes a 2000 vote against granting China permanent most-favored nation status for trade. Let’s take stock: In making his claim, Johnson notes that a side effect of the stimulus bill, which Feingold backed, was that in limited cases -- particularly in renewable energy -- foreign companies would benefit from some of the money. The approach spurs job growth in America as well, but undeniably would create some overseas jobs, too. Johnson tries to bolster this claim by citing a specific Texas project involving China and some 3,000 related jobs to be created there. But he twists Democratic objections to the possibility into alleged support for it. And the outcry itself has prompted revisions that mean more jobs here -- and so far no application has been made by project officials for any stimulus money. What’s more, Feingold backed the Buy American provisions that were included in the bill, saying they were a step forward. We rate Johnson’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04259	Half the lottery directors across the country had not run a lottery before they were hired.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/nov/13/brian-robinson/its-good-bet-your-lottery-director-doesnt-have-lot/	Georgia’s $3.8 billion lottery is big business for the state, responsible for funding almost $1 billion for college scholarships and pre-kindergarten programs each year. With so much at stake, such a large enterprise is closely watched by the state’s top politicos. The spotlight fell last month on the Georgia Lottery Board when one of its members resigned because she thought the panel was feeling pressured to hire Gov. Nathan Deal’s budget director as the next lottery chief. The new chief, Debbie Dlugolenski Alford, a former director of the state’s Office of Planning and Budget and a member of the lottery board, had never worked for a lottery. Some officials, including a state Senate leader, questioned the selection and Alford’s qualifications. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson dismissed the criticism, telling an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter that half the lottery directors across the country had not run a lottery before they were hired. Ultimately, the state lottery board unanimously confirmed Alford for the job Oct. 25. We wondered whether Robinson’s claim was accurate. How many of the jurisdictions operating lotteries had directors without previous lottery experience? Was this an acceptable practice in the industry to roll the dice on an untested leader? And did a background in other professional fields qualify as related experience? The Georgia Lottery Corp. has been in operation for 19 years and has sales exceeding $45 billion, according to information on the lottery’s website. Of that amount, more than $13.8 billion has been transferred to the state’s Lottery for Education Account. At any given time, Georgia’s lottery operates nine online or computerized games and about 40 instant ticket games. We asked Robinson for any documentation to support his claim. The governor’s office provided a chart of lottery directors in 43 states, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The data, compiled by the governor’s office with a July 24 date, included a list of lottery CEOs and their former or concurrent occupation. The chart also included a background column on whether the CEO had lottery experience. When asked, an office spokeswoman did not explain how the office qualified lottery experience, and whether it was based on any specific requirement such as length of time in office, training or related professional work. Not content to take the governor’s office chart at face value, we did our own research on the 46 lottery chiefs listed on the chart. PolitiFact Georgia’s research found that 22 directors on the list appeared to have no previous lottery experience, including the directors for the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands lotteries. The limited background information found on those two directors did not appear to include any previous lottery experience. For the most part, the governor’s office was accurate in its assessments, if previous lottery experience included sitting on a lottery board or commission, or serving in some other job for the same state lottery, such as legal counsel. In a few cases, the chart information was incorrect based on our research of online biographies, related media articles or announcements and the lotteries’ websites. For example, the chart lists former Georgia Lottery chief Margaret deFrancisco as having no previous lottery experience. In fact, DeFrancisco had been director of the New York Lottery before coming to Atlanta. And the governor’s office listed Arizona’s lottery executive director, Jeff Hatch-Miller, as having previous experience, but his biography included no mention of previous lottery work. Hatch-Miller’s experience included time served on the state commission in charge of regulating utilities and time spent in the Arizona Legislature. Overall, the operation of lotteries is done at the state level. There is no overarching organization or federal department with regulatory authority. Within the industry, the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, based in Geneva, Ohio, acts as the trade group for lotteries and provides support to lottery administrators. Membership consists of jurisdictions operating lotteries, including 43 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, five Canadian provinces and Mexico. Qualifications for lottery directors or CEOs are determined by the states, said David Gale, the NASPL’s executive director. The NASPL does not keep statistics on lottery directors’ backgrounds. "With past experience you’ll find a mix. There are some directors without previous lottery experience, but they have some business, budgeting and security experience that is significant in operating a lottery," Gale said. Also notable, he said, some of the top lottery positions are appointed positions that can be political appointments. Direct experience in operating a lottery is not irrelevant, but it is only one of many qualities to consider in a CEO’s role, said Paul Jason, director of the Public Research Gaming Institute. A director with ties to the governor’s office or state legislature could be important in navigating between those offices and personalities and the lottery corporation, he said. Georgia’s lottery has a "deep bench" of talented top management that can deal with the management of the lottery and can help the incoming director, making direct experience unnecessary [for the director], Jason said. So let’s review. Robinson, the governor’s spokesman, shunned criticism about the state’s new lottery director having no previous lottery experience when selected for the job last month. Robinson told a newspaper reporter that half the country’s lottery directors had not run lotteries before taking the top job. Robinson’s claim is correct -- in most cases. There is some room for interpretation. Still, we rate Robinson’s statement Mostly True.	None	Brian Robinson	None	None	None	2012-11-13T06:00:00	2012-10-11	['None']
pomt-08156	"I have won more elections than any chairman since 1938."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/03/michael-steele/rnc-chair-michael-steele-boasts-he-has-won-more-el/	With Michael's Steele's term as chairman of the Republican National Committee set to expire in January, several candidates have emerged as possible replacements. Steele hasn't yet announced whether he will seek another term, but last week he circulated a memo to RNC members defending himself against some of his GOP critics and highlighting his achievements as chairman. Asked in an NPR interview on Nov. 8, 2010, about the public grumblings from some Republican officials about RNC fundraising, Steele dismissed the criticism, saying it was "about the fact that they don't want me in this job, to put it rather bluntly." Steele defended his tenure as RNC chairman, saying, "I have won more elections than any chairman since 1938. In fact, none of my predecessors have been able to put together the kind of combination of wins." The battle for RNC chairman promises to heat up quickly in the coming month, so we decided to check Steele's talking point, that he has "won more elections than any chairman since 1938." We e-mailed the RNC press office for backup, and they pointed us to a story in the Cook Political Report that characterized the Republicans' gain of 63 House seats in the 2010 midterm elections as "the most seismic shift of House seats in a midterm election since 1938." We checked it out, and if Steele had specified that he was talking only about seat changes in the House, he'd be accurate. The 64-seat gain by Republicans this year is more than any year since 1939 (when Republicans picked up a whopping 81 seats). But Steele didn't say seat changes. And, in fact, Republicans won more seats in the House -- 246 -- in 1946. The number of Republican House wins this year is actually still unsettled, as a handful of very close races are still being sorted out. But provided the Republicans currently leading in those races are ultimately declared the winners, the final tally would be 243 Republican seats. That's awfully close but not quite as many House wins for Republicans as in 1946. More importantly, though, Steele didn't say he was talking only about the House. The RNC also supports Republican candidates in U.S. Senate, governor and state legislature elections. To be clear, Republicans did very well in all of these areas in the 2010 midterms. But the GOP has had better years in Senate and gubernatorial elections. An analysis by the American Enterprise Institute of 100 years worth of midterm election gains made by the party out of power shows that the six seats picked up in the Senate this year are fewer than in 1942 (10 seats); 1946 (13 seats); and 1994 (nine seats). And when it comes to governor elections, you also don't need to go back as far as 1938 to find a year in which Republicans picked up more state capitals. This year, six governors' seats changed to Republican, but 11 governors' seats changed to Republican in 1994. As for state legislature elections, it was a banner election for Republicans this year, with about 690 seats switching to Republican. Because some states hold state legislative elections in odd years, the National Conference of State Legislatures prefers to look at two-year cycles. By that measure, Republicans have gained 724 seats, Tim Storey, an elections analyst with the NCSL. There are now more Republicans holding state legislative seats than at any point since 1928, Storey said. Of the 7,382 total state legislative seats, 53 percent are now occupied by Republicans. "It's definitely an historic high-water mark," Storey said. But strictly speaking, Republicans gained even more state legislative seats in 1966 (when they picked up 762 seats -- 38 more than in this two-year cycle). The authors of the AEI analysis, James Fortier and Jennifer Marsico, also calculated a midterm power ranking (based on the average of their rankings in four categories -- House, Senate, governor and state legislature elections). The Republican gains in 2010 ranked sixth. That's behind 1994 (a year of major Republican gains) and 1958 (which Democrats dominated). "Overall, it was one of the best years for Republicans in the last 60 years," Fortier said. If Steele decides to seek another term as chairman of the RNC, he can certainly boast about significant Republican gains in the midterm election. But when he said, "I have won more elections than any chairman since 1938," that's only true if you were to consider just the seat changes -- as opposed to the actual number of wins -- in the U.S. House. Republicans also picked up seats in the Senate this year, but they gained more in 1942, 1946 and 1994; Republican gains in governor elections were greater in 1994; and GOP gains in state legislatures were greater in 1966. And so we rate Steele's claim Half True.	None	Michael Steele	None	None	None	2010-12-03T13:16:01	2010-11-08	['None']
pomt-00246	"I voted to defund sanctuary cities."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2018/oct/06/claire-mccaskill/mccaskill-has-voted-and-against-defunding-sanctuar/	While Democrats nationwide have embraced sanctuary cities, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill is touting the opposite on the campaign trail. On Sept. 10 in a question-and-answer session at Truman State University, the senator said she "voted to defund sanctuary cities" when asked whether she supported them, according to a transcript by the Columbia Daily Tribune. She then talked about the importance of cooperating with law enforcement but said she empathized with children and parents separated at the border. So-called "sanctuary cities" are jurisdictions that have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement particularly when concerning undocumented immigrants. But McCaskill, who is defending her seat against state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has been attacked by many conservative groups for helping sanctuary cities. So who is telling the truth? This isn’t the first time McCaskill expressed her opposition to sanctuary cities. In response to an ad by One Nation, her campaign released a fact check of its own in August, stating she "voted to crack down on sanctuary cities." It referenced the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which reported in February that "McCaskill was one of four Democrats who, this month, voted with Republicans to clamp down on so-called ‘sanctuary cities’ during a string of failed immigration votes in the Senate." PolitiFact looked into the specific vote in February as well as others, and we found six votes which can be grouped into three types. • One vote on the "cloture motion": This is the vote just mentioned, where on Feb. 15, McCaskill voted yes on the cloture motion for an amendment that would not allow sanctuary jurisdictions to receive various economic grants. A "cloture motion" is a move to end the debate and hold the final vote. This amendment failed to get enough votes to do that. • Two votes on "cloture on the motion to proceed": This move essentially puts the bill onto the floor for debate and consideration in the first place. In October 2015 and July 2016, McCaskill voted no on this move for two bills that would prohibit sanctuary cities from receiving certain grants. Both bills failed to get past this step. • Three votes tabling an amendment: In 2007, 2008 and 2009, McCaskill voted to table three amendments sponsored by former Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana that would prohibit funding for sanctuary localities to develop their community policing. By definition, tabling legislation is to simply postpone consideration. But tabling legislation also effectively kills it. All three of Vitter’s amendments were tabled. It should be noted that all six votes were procedural, and none were explicitly on the actual issue itself. The question is now whether these votes should count as voting for or against an issue. Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee, said that ultimately these are just procedural votes. But, he added, "procedures often help determine substantive outcomes." It’s along these lines that political science professor Gregory Koger of the University of Miami argues the procedural votes mentioned, by proxy, count as votes on the actual issue. "The key question is what these votes mean in context," said Koger. "What do senators think they are voting on? What are the consequences of a ‘yea’ or ‘nay’ vote?" Wolfensberger said procedural votes can be merely partisan rather than substantive in some cases. In the House, members of the minority party often try to delay the process even though in the end, they end up voting with the majority party. "In deciphering procedural votes, one should look at what the legislator says, not just what they do," he said. It is clear, regarding the February 2018 vote, that McCaskill intended to defund sanctuary cities, citing this stance because of the murder of a Missouri man by a person staying in the country illegally. But what about the other five votes that seemed to be against defunding those cities? What was her intent back then? In a 2017 Joplin Globe article, McCaskill was reported as saying that she voted against defunding sanctuary cities because it would deter immigrants from reporting crimes. PolitiFact Missouri also reached out to the McCaskill campaign to ask for the reasoning behind those five votes. The campaign cited the community policing funding cuts and how law enforcement was against them as a reason for one of the votes. The campaign did not outrightly deny her past votes against defunding, saying that "how she voted on other proposals does not change that fact" she voted to defund sanctuary cities. Our ruling McCaskill said she "voted to defund sanctuary cities." The vote her campaign references, despite being procedural, had the proxy effect of voting for the defunding, experts point out, especially considering the context where McCaskill has explicitly stated she takes that stance. The rest of her voting record, however, is against defunding sanctuary cities, and her intent back then supports the idea that those votes were substantive, too. So groups who attack her on this stance have a point. In short, she voted most recently to defund, but other votes show her defending sanctuary cities. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-02792	"44% of homeless people are employed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/04/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-44-percent-homeless-people-are-/	As President Barack Obama used a Dec. 4, 2013, speech to turn the national conversation to economic inequality, we thought it might be a good time to check into a Facebook post a reader recently sent us. The post said: "44% of homeless people are employed. Shouldn't work be an escape from poverty?" We wondered if that was accurate. Sourcing the claim We began by looking into the source of the Facebook post. The meme being circulated was created by a website called Occupy*Posters, which provides eye-catching "memes" for supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement to share on social media. Occupy*Posters did not respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact, but the group footnotes its sources, and it urges caution when people share them. "While some of the posters here are expressive of only opinion," the group’s website says, "great care is taken to ensure that the many posters here which present data mesh with solid facts. Still, due to human imperfections, you should independently verify information in the posters here before using them in any important way. Toward that end, it is the normal practice here to diligently, almost obsessively, cite all sources." The footnote provided in the meme pointed to a fact sheet from the National Coalition Against Homelessness, an advocacy group. The document says, "44% of homeless people ... have jobs and can't escape homelessness." However, this document doesn’t provide the original source of the 44 percent figure, and the group did not respond to an inquiry. After some digging, however, we feel comfortable in saying that the statistic comes from a report by the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. The report -- "Homelessness: Programs and the People They Serve: Findings of the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients" -- found that "almost half (44 percent) of homeless clients did some paid work during the 30 days before being interviewed." So that would give the Facebook post a measure of truth. Still, we uncovered two important caveats. The data’s age First, the data is old. The report was published in 1999, and the data it used were collected in 1996. That makes the statistics nearly 18 years old, which is practically ancient by social-science standards. That said, despite this advanced age, there are no more recent statistics that address the question of how many homeless people are earning money from working, said Mary Cunningham, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute who specializes in homelessness and housing. "It would be much better if we had up-to-date data, but that is not always possible," said Gary Burtless, an economist specializing in employment for the Brookings Institution. "When using 17-year-old data, however, we have to ask ourselves whether other critical factors have changed in the intervening years." In this case, a key issue is whether there’s reason to think that the nature of homelessness and employment has changed in the intervening years. And experts say it may have. The Great Recession and the slow recovery have squeezed job prospects even for people who aren’t homeless and have extensive work histories. Nationally, the unemployment rate is about 2 percentage points higher now than it was when the data was collected in the mid 1990s. So it’s certainly plausible that homeless people today would be less likely to secure a job than they were back then, during an era of robust economic growth. "You could argue that the employment picture for homeless people might be worse today due to the recession, though it’s hard to say with any amount of certainty," Cunningham said. The definition of "employed" The other issue we’ll note is what the Facebook post communicates by its use of the term "employed." When we first read it, we assumed "employed" meant that someone held a regular job. Certainly the meme’s message would be powerful if it said that almost half of homeless Americans aren’t getting paid enough from their regular jobs to be able to afford a home. However, the Urban Institute defined its figures somewhat differently. The report said that "of those who report working in the last 30 days, 20 percent did so in a job lasting or expected to last at least three months." The remainder worked temporary or day-labor jobs or peddled or sold personal belongings. The language of the report is a bit unclear; either the figure to pay attention to is 20 percent (rather than the meme’s 44 percent), or even as low as 9 percent (if it’s one-fifth of 44 percent). Either way, the number cited in the Facebook post is too high if you’re looking at homeless people who have a traditional, longer-term, steady job. "I agree that taking an odd job is not the same as having a steady job," said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair, which suggests that the smaller number seems "more relevant." But not all experts agreed. Burtless noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics counts an "employed person" as someone who, during the time period studied, "did any work at all as paid employees, worked in their own business or profession or on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers in a family-operated enterprise." Since this more expansive definition is as close as we can get to an official government definition, Burtless said, it seems like a reasonable standard to use, even if other plausible definitions exist. In addition, "even ‘uneven’ employment is a sign of willingness to work," said Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. "So it depends on the point one is trying to make." Our ruling The Facebook post said that 44 percent of homeless people are employed. On the one hand, the data is 18 years old, and the percentage who have a regular job is, at most, less than half that. Still, this is the most recent data available, and some experts say a broader more generous definition of "employed" is defensible. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02288	Says the goal of the Affordable Care Act was to get 30 million people insured, but it only got 7 million.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/04/marco-rubio/rubio-says-health-care-law-fell-short-goal-30-mill/	The White House celebrated earlier this week when 7.1 million Americans signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act marketplaces since they opened in October 2013. Predictably, the law’s critics were not as thrilled. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., spoke on Hannity Tuesday night about what he sees as the reform’s shortcomings. "I mean, the purpose of Obamacare was not to get 7 million people or 6 million people, or whatever the number now is, to sign up on a website," Rubio said. "The purpose of Obamacare, according to them, was to get more people insurance. And by all accounts, it's going to fall woefully short. You're still going to have 30-some-odd million people in this country uninsured." We wanted to know if Rubio’s claim was correct that the health care law was falling short of its goals. Rubio’s office didn’t return our request for comment. One thing that struck us is that Rubio is mixing up numbers for the law’s first year and what policy makers hope the law achieves over the long run. No one expected to see the law’s full effects in the first year after the health care marketplaces opened. The best authority on health care numbers is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which regularly publishes independent estimates of the law’s effects. In February 2013, months before healthcare.gov launched, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 7 million people would sign up on the marketplaces by March 31, 2014, after the marketplace had been open for six months. The CBO estimated that by 2019, 27 million people will have signed up on the marketplaces. There will still be roughly 29 million people uninsured by that time, which is close to the number Rubio mentioned. But that’s down from 55 million uninsured in 2013. Not everyone will end up with health insurance for a variety of reasons. Undocumented workers aren’t eligible to shop on the marketplaces. People living in states that have decided not to expand Medicaid will also be among the uninsured. The law also has a hardship exemption. That means homeless people, domestic violence victims, people caring for disabled family members and others can apply to have the penalty fee waived for not purchasing insurance under the reform’s individual mandate. Our ruling Rubio claimed the Obama administration’s goal for the Affordable Care Act was to get 30 million Americans insured, not the 7 million who enrolled by the March 31 deadline. Down the road, there are targets to insure millions more via the online marketplaces. But the clearly stated goal for 2014, that the White House hit just in time, was 7 million signups. By 2019, that number is expected to jump to 27 million. Rubio does have a point that many Americans will remain uninsured under the reform, but his claim twists the administration’s timeline for enrolling uninsured Americans. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2014-04-04T10:13:29	2014-04-01	['None']
pomt-07922	Mitchell International Airport is the "the third busiest airport in the world and the number one busiest in the country."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/30/lee-holloway/acting-milwaukee-county-executive-lee-holloway-say/	One of Lee Holloway’s first acts after becoming acting Milwaukee County executive was to put his name on the monthly press release about passenger counts at Mitchell International Airport. Holloway, the County Board chairman, is running to fill the job in the spring election and -- like his predecessor, now-Gov. Scott Walker -- touts success at the airport at campaign appearances. At a Jan. 21, 2011 forum at the Marquette University Law School, he called Mitchell the "third busiest airport in the world and the number one busiest airport in the country." That stopped a few scribbling pens. And some in the audience scratched their heads. Busier than O’Hare, Atlanta or LaGuardia? Third busiest in the world? In the debate appearance -- viewed by a standing room only audience, aired on television and available on YouTube -- Holloway got it wrong. Mitchell is the nation’s fastest growing airport and -- at least for a while last year -- was the third fastest growing airport in the world. It’s not the busiest. Holloway has gotten his airport facts right on several other occasions, including a Journal Sentinel editorial board visit, two press releases, and his Jan. 26, 2011 "State of the County" speech. Well, close to right -- the world ranking is based on outdated statistics. The most recent airport stats: A little more than 9.8 million passengers traveled through Mitchell in 2010, according to airport data. That’s a 24.1 percent increase over the year before. In December, there were 774,341 passengers, up 6.4 percent from the same month in 2009. More than 2 million passengers changed planes at Mitchell last year, a 25 percent increase over the year before. However, Mitchell’s status as among the fastest growing in the world is waning. The airport was fourth fastest growing in the world in the first quarter of 2010 and third in the second quarter, but tumbled to 16th in the third quarter, according to Airports Council International, an industry trade group. (Fourth quarter numbers aren’t yet available.) Milwaukee was the only U.S. airport on the list, and in the second quarter trailed only Istanbul, Turkey and Moscow. In the third quarter, airports in several South American countries surged ahead of Milwaukee -- seven of them landed in the top 15. "We anticipate that MKE will continue to grow, but that the rate of growth will flatten as we begin comparing to growth rates of 30 - 40 percent" in the fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2010, said airport spokeswoman Patricia Rowe. PolitiFact Wisconsin checked a similar airport statement made in September by Walker, then a candidate for governor. In his victory speech on primary election night, Walker said the airport was the fastest growing airport in the country and responsible for 1,000 jobs. Airport consultant Michael Boyd, of Boyd Group International in Evergreen Colo., told us then that passengers were enjoying more flights and comparatively lower fares because three airlines -- AirTran Airways, Southwest and Republic -- are "trying to kill each other." "It has nothing to do with county government," Boyd said. "It has to do with airline economics." Some of the large increases are the result of the year-to-year comparisons. Midwest Airlines, for instance, dramatically slashed the number of its destinations from Mitchell before it was bought by Republic. The airline now operates as Frontier and has steadily added flights. Walker’s statement, which mixed in job growth, earned a Half True. Where does Holloway’s nation’s-busiest statement land? Holloway has made a more precise airport claim on other occasions. But he was wrong when he said at the candidates’ forum that Mitchell was one of the world’s "busiest" airports, and the busiest in the nation. Those rankings relate to passenger growth, not busy-ness. What’s more, the world ranking he used (third) came from the second quarter data from 2010 -- and that’s old data. We’re now No. 17 according to the latest figures. Holloway’s incorrect message went out to a wider audience and was echoed by media outlets covering the event. Holloway’s claim is False.

pomt-07563	"Before this (federal health care) law was enacted, Florida parents ... were able to purchase inexpensive 'child-only' coverage for their children. The law’s 'consumer protections' have now eliminated that choice in Florida."	false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/31/rick-scott/scott-says-new-federal-health-care-act-eliminated-/	To mark the one-year anniversary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010, Republican leaders have been rallying their voices and calling for a repeal of the health care measure. From television advertisements like this one featuring Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee to newspaper opinion pieces, Republicans continue to drum their talking points against the health care overhaul. Likewise, Democrats have also been using the anniversary to grow support for the measure by hosting events like community picnics and forums. Gov. Rick Scott was among those adding to the Republican chorus of dissent against the law. On March 23, 2011, he penned an opinion piece for the Tampa Tribune decrying "ObamaCare." "As important as health insurance is, most people need a job more than they need health insurance," Scott wrote. Scott, a former hospital chain CEO, ran on a platform opposing health care reform, and has supported the Florida-led lawsuit against the law. Before becoming a candidate, Scott founded Conservatives for Patients' Rights, a group dedicated to opposing federal health care reform. "Before this law was enacted, Florida parents who were laid off or who couldn't get dependent coverage at work were able to purchase inexpensive 'child-only' coverage for their children," Scott wrote. "The law's 'consumer protections' have now eliminated that choice in Florida and 17 other states." We wondered about Scott's claim. Did the federal health care law really eliminate all inexpensive child-only insurance options in Florida? We turned to Scott's press office to request materials that would support the governor's claim but never received a response. Our research, however, found that child-only insurance programs do still exist, and the state runs one of them. The health care law Let's start with the law and its consumer protection provisions. The law was signed by Obama on March 23, 2010, and is aimed at ensuring that all Americans have access to health insurance by barring health insurance providers from refusing coverage for folks with pre-existing conditions. The entire law is set to go into effect by 2014; however, there are elements of the law, namely those geared toward children, that were launched in 2010. For example, children can now remain under their parents' insurance until age 26, when previously most had to be off the plan by age 19 or when they stopped being enrolled full-time in college. Another measure set into motion in 2010, the one referenced by Scott, bans insurance providers from refusing to insure a child based on pre-existing conditions. The child-only provision was set to demonstrate on a smaller scale what the law aimed to do when it is fully launched in 2014 -- ensuring coverage for everyone, healthy or sick, who applied for health insurance. Except, unlike the "health care for all" provisions set for 2014, the child-only provisions did not include language requiring insurers to write insurance policies for children. In other words, they couldn't deny a child coverage based on a pre-condition -- but the law doesn't require them to sell a child-specific policy in the first place. "Nothing in the Affordable Care Act, or any other existing federal law, allows us to require insurance companies to offer a particular type of policy at this time," Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius acknowledged in an Oct. 13, 2010, letter to Jane L. Cline, president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Leading up to the Sept. 23, 2010, start date of the child-protection provisions, some of the nation's leading providers -- including WellPoint, UnitedHealth Group, Aetna, Cigna and Humana -- stopped selling the child-only policies. Several cited concerns that the law did not provide guarantees that parents wouldn't wait until a child was gravely ill before purchasing a plan. "The regulations provide a very powerful incentive for parents to wait until their children are sick to buy coverage, which drives up costs for everyone else," said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a leading lobbyist group for insurers. Doug Lynch, vice president of actuary for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, likened the measure to letting a person purchase homeowners insurance once their house is on fire. "As an example, on the way to the hospital, a parent could call from the ambulance to get coverage," Lynch said in a March 28, 2011, telephone interview. "There was no waiting period … this type of system lends itself to abuse. If you do cover that case, then you would need to charge everyone for that abuse." Sebelius offered some suggestions so that private insurers would continue to sell the child-only plans -- imposing a surcharge if a parent dropped their child's coverage and subsequently reapplied for it, and adjusting rates based on health status as permitted by state law (though by 2014, they will no longer be allowed to charge rates based on health status). She also noted in her letter to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that insurance companies could set enrollment periods, so that parents could not just sign up at any time, so long as the periods they set are consistent with state laws governing enrollment periods. Some providers say that they may be willing to return to selling child-only policies in Florida if the kinks of the law's language are ironed out before 2014. "For us, it's a market issue," Gwyn Dilday, spokeswoman for Cigna, said. "If the market dynamics change in Florida, it's something that we would consider." Dilday said Cigna did not stop selling child-only policies solely because of the health care law, but also because the child-only policies accounted for a tiny portion of their overall business. "There were a lot of factors in our decision," Dilday said. "We’re such a small player in this line of business. It's a very, very small amount of policies, less than 1 percent of the 100,000 policies we have nationally. We had to take that into consideration." Other options While private providers have stopped selling the child-specific policies in Florida, there are still two other government-funded options available to parents -- KidCare and the newly formed Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) Established by the state Legislature in 1998, KidCare, a program run under the Florida Department of Health, provides health insurance not only for low-income children, but for parents of all income levels. Parents pay a monthly premium based on their income, so they can pay anywhere from $15 a month per child to $159. "We did realize when they started leaving, that we were probably it," said Jennifer Lloyd, chief external affairs officer for KidCare, referring to the private providers no longer selling child-only policies. As of January 2011, there are 1.7 million children enrolled in KidCare, the bulk of those insured through Medicaid. Those not covered by Medicaid amount to 281,000 children as of March 2011, according to Lloyd. Lloyd said the program is open for enrollment throughout the year, but it must cap enrollment once the program reaches its annual funding limit. For the 2010-2011 fiscal year, the program received $510 million in state and federal matching funds. Still, Lloyd noted that the last time the program had to close enrollment because of financial limitations was in 2002-2003. Despite private providers no longer selling child-specific policies in the state, Lloyd said enrollment in KidCare has "remained steady." "I cannot say that we've seen a spike in enrollment," Lloyd said. "We saw a spike in applications in January, a little spike, but we think with all the chatter surrounding the health care act, it just got people thinking about health insurance more." Lloyd said that while the program does outreach at schools to inform parents, it isn't as widely advertised as plans from private insurers who may have more advertising money at their disposal. "People might forget that we’re an option," Lloyd said. Another option for parents of children with pre-existing conditions is enrollment in the federally funded Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP). The plan was created by the health care law, which allotted $5 billion to help fund high-risk insurance pools run by the states or the Department of Health and Human Services until 2014. In Florida, the plan is administered directly by the Department of Health and Human Services, with plans for those under the age of 18 ranging from $196 to $263 a month. (For a full breakdown of how each state administers the PCIP program, check out this HHS website.) "The PCIP program is available for eligible children with pre-existing conditions who have been uninsured for at least six months," Sebelius wrote in her letter to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Our ruling So back to Scott's claim: Did the federal health care law eliminate an inexpensive insurance option for children in Florida? While elements of the law that took effect in 2010 have prompted private insurers to stop selling child-only policies, the state continues to offer a viable option for parents in the form of KidCare. For parents who are laid off or low-income, the KidCare rates are inexpensive. And children with pre-existing conditions can also seek enrollment in the new Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) created by the federal law -- though the rates are higher. Without private insurers participating, the choices for parents have certainly been reduced. But eliminated, as Scott said? No. We rate this claim False.

pomt-03686	Right now, if Rhode Island police come across a young person with a gun, "they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/23/linda-finn/state-rep-linda-finn-says-rhode-island-police-who-/	In the wake of the Newtown, Conn., shootings, the Rhode Island General Assembly is considering a package of bills intended to tighten the state’s gun laws, including restrictions on assault weapons and harsher penalties for gun violations. WPRI’s "Newsmakers" explored the topic on a program featuring state Rep. Linda D. Finn, D-Middletown, who has argued for more gun restrictions, and state Rep. Michael W. Chippendale, R-Foster, who has argued that laws already in place can address concerns if only they were properly enforced. At one point, Tim White, the show’s host, brought up one of the proposed bills, which would make it illegal for anyone under 18 to possess a gun, aside from exceptions such as hunting, rifle ranges and competitive target shooting. Chippendale called the proposal "well intended, but poorly drafted," saying it would contradict another law on the books that provides for licensed hunting by young people. Finn countered that the proposal is intended for police on the streets of Providence and other cities when they come upon a minor with a firearm. "Because right now, if they [the police] come across a [young] person with a gun, they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them," Finn said. We wondered whether Finn’s statement was accurate. The legislation in question is actually an amendment of Rhode Island statute 11-47-33. The statute currently says "possession and use" of certain firearms by someone under age 18 is prohibited in Rhode Island unless he or she has had a permit issued -- under 11-47-34 -- by the Rhode Island State Police or by a local police chief. And that permit can only be issued, the law states, "upon satisfactory proof of being engaged in a course of training in the use of firearms at a regular and recognized camp or rifle range, and provided that the person has the written consent of a guardian." The bill in the legislature calls for dropping the words "and use" from 11-47-33. The reason? According to Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin’s office, the bill was filed because "currently, for a minor to be guilty of possession of a firearm they must possess and use the firearm." Steven M. Pare, the Providence public safety commissioner, said police chiefs support the revision of statute 11-47-33 that would remove the words "and use," making it illegal in most cases for juveniles simply to possess a firearm. Despite Finn’s assertion the the police can’t take guns away from minors, Pare, said that police can and do charge young people with possession of handguns, using another statute, 11-47-8, which prohibits minors from obtaining a carry/conceal permit. But there’s another issue in current law, that gives some credence to Finn’s claim. The Attorney General’s office says that due to what it calls a loophole, the law does not cover shotguns, rifles and other long guns, Kempe said, which could include such weapons as an AK-47, AR-15 and an M-16 -- so long as those are not fully automatic. (Possession of automatic weapons is illegal in all cases.) In other words, if the police see a juvenile carrying such a weapon, they can’t confiscate it under current law. Kempe said the "long guns" at issue are rarely something the police encounter on the streets involving minors; pistols and revolvers, which are already covered under current law and for which the police can arrest and seize the guns, are much more common, she said. Our ruling State Rep. Linda D. Finn said that if the police come across a young person with a gun, "they really don't legally have the right to take it away from them." Under current law, police can seize handguns from juveniles, the weapons most commonly used in street crime. But they can’t seize rifles and other so-called long guns. New legislation could change that. But for now, we rate Finn’s claim Half True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-09212	California Republican gubernatorial hopeful Meg Whitman "contributed to, and campaigned, for" Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/20/steve-poizner/poizner-says-whitman-supported-liberal-icon-barbar/	The Republican primary to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) as governor of California has spawned a flood of ads attacking both Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner -- the two GOP frontrunners for the nomination. One ad, aired by Poizner beginning in April, argues that Whitman "contributed to, and campaigned, for" Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer -- a serious failing to those in the GOP primary electorate, who view the liberal Boxer as an ideological nemesis. The part about contributing to Boxer is easy enough to check. A search through the campaign donor database of the Federal Election Commission shows that Whitman made three donations totaling $8,000 to entities linked to Boxer, all in November 2003. The question of whether Whitman campaigned for Boxer is a bit more complicated. There's no question that she lent her name to Boxer's cause. Whitman joined 14 other Silicon Valley executives -- including John Chambers of Cisco, venture capitalist John Doerr and Chuck Geschke, co-founder of Adobe Systems -- in signing a letter written on "Barbara Boxer for Senate" letterhead dated April 30, 2003. In what was labeled "An Open Letter to California’s Technology Community," the signers of the letter wrote, "We ask you to join us in supporting U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer in her campaign for re-election in 2004. Senator Boxer is a dynamic and courageous leader for high technology and biotechnology communities, and she is making a difference for us every day." The campaign has argued since last fall that Whitman supported Boxer for pragmatic reasons, in order to help her company. “As CEO of an online commerce leader, Meg backed Sen. Boxer because of her efforts with Republican Sen. George Allen to fight taxes on the Internet," said Dan Comstock, a spokesman for the Whitman campaign. Boxer actually wasn't alone in that stance: In a Sacramento Bee column, senior editor Dan Morain wrote that all of Boxer's Republican opponents that year joined Boxer in opposing the tax. Still, it's clear that Whitman not only supported Boxer financially but also by lending her name. Does that count as having "campaigned for her"? We'd bet that most people would think the definition of "campaigning for" a candidate means to stump with them, canvass neighborhoods, make fundraising phone calls or speak to audiences on the behalf. Signing on to a letter, by contrast, is a more passive kind of support, something closer to an endorsement statement. The Whitman campaign said she did nothing more active for Boxer than to sign the letter, and no evidence has surfaced to contradict that. The closest she came in the letter to "campaigning" was writing, "Join our effort to keep Senator Boxer in the U.S. Senate by adding your name to the growing list of her supporters in the high-tech community." Ultimately, whether that constitutes "campaigning" is a judgment call, and our view is that it probably would have been more appropriate for the Poizner campaign to have used the word "endorsed" rather than "campaigned." But it's unquestionable that Whitman supported Boxer financially and rhetorically in 2003, so on balance we rate Poizner's claim Mostly True.

pomt-10979	"An elderly British politician has been savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he ‘welcomed’ the U.S. president to the United Kingdom."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/17/blog-posting/no-evidence-political-motives-ambassador-attack/	The former British ambassador to the United States was hospitalized after being attacked in a tube station. Police are still investigating the altercation, which left Sir Christopher Meyer bloodied but in stable condition. Some bloggers have connected the attack with President Donald Trump’s visit the next day and the protests that went alongside it. On July 13, protesters gathered in the city, guiding a large, baby Trump balloon past Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Meanwhile, Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May at a military demonstration. Earlier that week, Meyer was beaten in the Victoria London Underground Station. An article, posted on clickbait site Neon Nettle, claimed that Meyer was "savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he ‘welcomed’ the U.S. president to the United Kingdom." This seemed out of line with other reports of the event, which did not mention political motives. We decided to investigate whether Trump’s visit was tied directly to Meyer’s attack. The editorial A few days before the protests, the Independent published an editorial written by Meyer. That same day, he was attacked. In the piece, Meyer cautioned protesters against angering Trump. "Our security and prosperity depend in large measure on keeping our close and long-standing partnership in good working order," he writes. Meyer argued that in spite of Trump pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris agreement on climate change, engaging with the president and maintaining close ties between the countries is imperative. Neon Nettle hypothesized that this show of support was enough to rile up "a gang of anti-Trump protestors." The attack Meyer’s wife told The Times that she suspected the attack was politically motivated: "He is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions." However, London police said it is more likely that Meyer’s assailants wanted to rob him. There has been no evidence released thus far to tie the attack to the protests or to suggest that Meyer was targeted. The Neon Nettle article says that Meyer was attacked by "a mob of thugs" involved with the protests against Trump. However, only two suspects were arrested: a 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy. They were released from custody while the investigation into their involvement continues, according to a press release by the British Transport Police. Additionally, the attack took place on Wednesday, July 11, two full days before the official protests and a day before Trump arrived in the country. The Neon Nettle also alleges that "violent riots" have occurred throughout London in response to Trump’s visit. While there were massive protests against Trump in the capital, there were few news reports of violence. In a single altercation outside of a pub, one man was arrested for hitting a Trump supporter. Our ruling There has been no evidence released linking the attack of a former ambassador to Trump’s visit to the United Kingdom. Meyer was beaten by two teenagers, not a "gang of anti-Trump protestors," as Neon Nettle alleges. The protests against Trump, which took place two days after the attack, were relatively uneventful as far as violence goes. Because police are still investigating the incident, we cannot conclusively say that it was not motivated by politics. However, for that same reason, Neon Nettle goes too far to say that it was. Further, it is an overstatement to say that the anti-Trump protests were "violent riots." Our ruling is Mostly False.

pomt-13390	"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1. Thousands of shootings."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-chicago-has-experienced-thousand/	Lester Holt asked the major presidential candidates in their first debate how they would heal the nation’s racial divide, exacerbated by police shootings of unarmed African-Americans. Democrat Hillary Clinton called for a top-to-bottom re-examination of the criminal justice system to prevent uneven treatment of minorities under the law. Republican Donald Trump, stuck to his "law and order" approach, painting a bleak portrait of life for African-Americans and Hispanics "living in hell because it’s so dangerous." He zeroed in on Chicago, President Barack Obama’s hometown. "In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since Jan. 1. Thousands of shootings," Trump said. Has Chicago had thousands of shootings so far this year? Trump’s campaign showed us an article published on Forbes Sept. 8 that says of Chicago, "In 2015, 2,988 people were shot and 2016′s figure already stands at 2,949." The Chicago Tribune, which tracks neighborhood crimes through its Crime in Chicagoland project, has data supporting that shooting count for 2015. And as far as this year goes? From Jan. 1 to Sept. 26, there have been 3,210 shooting victims, according to the Chicago Tribune. The publication says the data it compiles is not the same as what the city offers, so numbers will not match those tracked by the city. "One shooting incident may have multiple victims, but it still counts officially as only one shooting," the Chicago Tribune site says. Even then, data released by the Chicago Police Department also shows there have been 2,521 shooting incidents in the city up to Sept. 18. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel delivered a speech Sept. 22 addressing high levels of crime in his city and ways to combat it, outlining a need for more policing, more jobs and crime prevention. "Gun violence in Chicago is unacceptable. ... It is pulling us apart at the very moment that our city needs us to come together," Emanuel said, according to the Tribune. "For all the things that make Chicago great, for all the things that make us proud to call ourselves Chicagoans, the violence that is happening corrodes our core. It is not the Chicago we know, and it is not the Chicago we love." While the number of shooting victims so far this year have surpassed 2015, it’s important to note that they do not represent homicides, experts told us. (However, the Tribune’s count of 550 homicides so far in 2016 also outnumbers the 2015 tally of 492 homicides.) "The word ‘shooting’ does not distinguish based on severity of the wound or the type of crime," said Adam Lankford, a criminology professor at the University of Alabama. Shooting statistics also include people who shot themselves by mistake. A shooting is simply a gun being fired, not someone being shot or killed, said Dewey Cornell, director of the Virginia Youth Violence Project at the University of Virginia. The city’s numbers are striking, but Cornell said violent crime in Chicago is much lower than it was 20 years ago, mirroring the national trend. When you have a flare-up in gang warfare in any community, there will be large increases in gun homicides, and Chicago has for more than a century had a gang problem that is much greater than other cities like New York, Cornell said. "There has been an increase in gun violence in Chicago in recent years, but Chicago does not represent the U.S. and is atypical of other large cities, so it does not make sense to use Chicago as an example to understand crime in the U.S.," Cornell added. A plausible explanation for the rise in shootings in Chicago is that gangs have been displaced from their former turf by the demolition of some housing projects, said George A. Mocsary, an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University School of Law. "Violence has ensued as the displaced gang members try to move into new territory claimed by other gangs," Mocsary said. Our ruling Trump said, "In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings." There have been more than 3,000 shooting victims in Chicago so far this year, according to media reports and gun violence experts. The count of shootings includes all types of shootings, including shootings of more than one person and on accident, and it should not be taken as a substitute for "homicides."

pomt-07227	"Gerry Connolly and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/02/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-gerry-connolly-maxed-out-us-debt/	Uncle Sam is sitting on a $14.3 trillion credit card bill, better known as the federal debt. Republicans and Democrats are squabbling about which party is to blame for the epic spending spree. The argument is part of a debate over how much -- or whether -- to raise the federal debt ceiling. The U.S. has hit its borrowing limit and the Treasury Department says the country could default on its loan payments if the limit is not raised by Aug. 2. The National Republican Congressional Committee pins the blame for the mess on Rep. Gerry Connolly, who represents a Northern Virginia district, and his Democratic colleagues. He is among 60 House Democrats being targeted with similar attacks by the NRCC, which works to elect Republicans to the chamber. "Gerry Connolly and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out," the NRCC said in a May 18 email and press release. Was it really Connolly -- or even all the House Democrats -- who maxed out America’s credit card? Let’s take a look. Connolly took office on Jan. 3, 2009 and narrowly won re-election in 2010. On the day he entered Congress, total federal debt stood at $10.63 trillion, according to the Treasury Department. On May 31 the debt stood at $14.34 trillion. That’s an increase of $3.72 trillion, or 35 percent, since Connolly became a Congressman. So right away it’s apparent Connolly himself couldn’t have maxed out the credit card. He simply hasn’t been around long enough to do so. How did the nation pile up so much debt? You might remember tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and former President George W. Bush during happier budget times -- tax cuts that were extended in December for two years under Democratic President Barack Obama. While some economists say these were needed to give the economy a kick, they also meant less money came in from tax revenue. Before the most recent extension, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits. Some will argue that tax cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth, but PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office last year said extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits. Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. Those began during the Bush years and continue under Obama. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that just two policies dating from the Bush Administration — tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — accounted for more than $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 "and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs." What do conservative economists say? Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio asked Brian Riedl, the lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, what he thought of the CBPP analysis. He was blunt. "Basically, their analysis fails basic statistics," he said in an email. Riedl referred us to his own blog, in which he wrote, "Imagine a basketball team that loses 100-98. It would make no sense to cherry-pick one single basket by their opponent and blame it for 100 percent of the loss – letting all other baskets scored off the hook. Yet that is essentially what CBPP is doing." Riedl’s broader point is that "one could cherry-pick" any number of spending or tax policies and blame them for the entire problem. "CBPP chose to pick the tax cuts, wars, stimulus/bailouts, and economic downturn to equal the sum of the deficit. One could have just as easily singled out Social Security and Medicaid (combined cost: $13 trillion), Medicare and net interest costs ($13 trillion), or discretionary spending ($15 trillion) for blame. There is no mathematical reason to single out the programs CBPP selected while ignoring the other costs." Where does this leave us? Each side is cherry-picking the numbers. The liberal think tank puts nearly all the blame on the wars, the tax cuts and the recession and its associated costs. The conservative think tank says the blame base is larger and involves entitlements as well as discretionary spending. DNCC spokeswoman Haley Morris cited a 2009 PolitiFact item that noted that when Bush took office in 2001, the national debt was $5.73 trillion. When he left eight years later, it was $10.7 trillion. "Pretty hard for GOP to argue about maxing out (the) credit card," she said. Let’s review. Yes, the nation’s debt has gone up rapidly during the two and a half years Gerry Connolly has been in office. Liberal economists blamed the big deficits on wars and tax cuts that were started under Bush, a Republican, but continued by Obama, a Democrat. Connolly supported the stimulus bill in 2009 and the tax cut extension in December 2010, and he has backed other measures that added to the federal deficit. But two-thirds of the federal deficit already existed when Connolly came into office. Why should he be held responsible for that? Going one step further, why should Democrats take the full hit? Republicans deserve blame here as well. The nation’s current financial situation is a rare bipartisan feat. At the same time, 35 percent of the nation’s debt has come during Connolly’s two-and-a-half years in Congress. We rate the NRCC’s attack Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00839	Under New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, homicides are up by 20 percent, and subway delays have soared 45 percent.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/23/greg-gutfeld/nyc-mayor-de-blasio-responsible-uptick-murders-and/	Fox News host Greg Gutfeld is no fan of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, and he laid bare his complaints in a personal commentary. "Unless you’re a well off liberal, it’s been a bad year for New York City," Gutfeld said on March 10, 2015. "Shootings are way up, homicides too by 20 percent. Subway delays have soared by 45 percent." "Is it any coincidence this is happening under the most progressive leader since Marx?" Gutfeld continued, "If he were a Republican with these stats, he'd be hog-tied, bobbing in the Hudson." We’ll take Gutfeld’s factual assertions about murders and subway waits in order and see how well they fit the data. Fox News sent us items from the New York Post that backed up Gutfeld. A March editorial noted that "homicides are up 20 percent in New York the first two months of this year over the same period in 2014." That is in line with New York Police Department statistics. As of March 8, 2015, there had been 59 murders, compared to 48 by the same time last year. But Candace McCoy, a criminologist at the City University of New York, urged a bit of caution in drawing conclusions too quickly. "Two months is not a trend," McCoy said. The danger of jumping on the latest figures is that the numbers can bounce around. Back in February, the city set a new record of 10 days without a single homicide but no one was ready to say that the Big Apple had cured itself of murder. McCoy also noted that in 2014, the city had the lowest number of slayings since 1963 -- just 333. That was de Blasio’s first year in office. "We can definitely say that homicides are not up 20 percent since de Blasio took office," McCoy said. "In fact, the trend is the opposite." If Gutfeld wanted to look at 2-month snapshot, it’s instructive to see what happened in 2013. By early March that year there had been 58 deaths, or just one less than in the same period in 2015. But having 58 or 59 deaths by March doesn’t necessarily translate into high numbers overall for the entire year. In 2013, the year closed out with just two more murders than in the record low year of 2014. So the number of murders by March doesn’t tell you much about how the entire year will turn out. Even the editorial that Fox News cited as a source was more restrained. "We’re reluctant to draw big conclusions from such limited data," the New York Post said. Subway blues Gutfeld said that delays for subway riders have shot up 45 percent. The New York Post reported that the average number of delays each month rose from about 29,000 in 2013 to over 43,000 in 2014. We went to the Metropolitan Transit Authority’s monthly reports for its Transit and Bus Committee, and there’s no problem with the numbers. The average number of delays is up, as Gutfeld said. We note that there are other ways to measure how well the system is running, such as looking at how often the trains run on-time. That also is worse compared with 2013, but not as dramatically -- just about 8 percent. John Raskin is executive director of Riders Alliance, an advocacy group for the people who rely on the city’s buses and trains. Raskin agreed that performance has dropped. He said it’s due to equipment breakdowns, repair work left over from Hurricane Sandy, and chronic underinvestment by New York state. But Raskin’s overarching point is that it makes no sense to blame de Blasio for the decline. "The subway system runs as an independent authority that reports to the state," Raskin said. "Someone connecting subway delays with the change in administration is showing they don’t understand how the transit system runs and is misleading people." While it might sound odd that the transit system of New York City isn’t controlled by the city, in fact the governor nominates the 17 members of the board that governs the Metropolitan Transit Authority and the state Senate confirms them. The mayor recommends four people for that board. One could argue that the city is free to put more money into the Metropolitan Transit Authority. The municipal budget contributes about $100 million each year, and one advocacy group, the NYPIRG Straphangers Campaign, wants that to rise to $125 million saying "the city should do better by the riding public." But the senior attorney for NYPIRG (New York Public Interest Research Group) Gene Russianoff told PunditFact that despite that stand, he puts real responsibility at the feet of the governor and the state Legislature. Our ruling Gutfeld faulted the performance of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and noted that murders are up 20 percent and subway delays are up 45 percent. Gutfeld’s numbers are correct, but he commits extreme cherry picking with the murder statistic. A full year assessment of de Blasio’s administration would show that the murder rate is holding about steady compared to the year before he took office. As for the increased suffering of subway riders, it is real, but a large portion of that falls outside of de Blasio’s direct control. The state wields final authority over the trains. While de Blasio could press to add more city funds, he doesn’t control the budget and his representatives represent less than a quarter of the votes on the MTA board. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01625	Wisconsin is "dead last in income growth" among midwestern states during Gov. Scott Walker’s term.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/28/blog-posting/bloggers-say-wisconsin-ranks-last-income-growth-/	In the heat of a political campaign, no advantage gained by one side goes unnoticed by the other. We saw that again after rating True a very narrow and specific claim by Gov. Scott Walker that Wisconsin leads 11 other Midwestern states in personal income growth over the one-year period that ended with the first quarter of 2014. Shortly after Walker blasted out that news, readers and Internet bloggers were contending the picture is not nearly so bright if more of Walker’s tenure is considered. "What if you examine the entire span of of the Walker administration?" reader and frequent commenter Jim Spice asked in a comment Aug. 14, 2014, on JSOnline.com and on Facebook. His conclusion: "I downloaded the data set from the BEA web site, and ran the numbers using 2010 Q4 as the starting point, and HEY, what do you know?! WI ranks DEAD LAST in income growth among those 12 states!" Others made similar claims, including a blogger on the liberal Daily Kos site. Are they right? Digging into the numbers We started with data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, the same source Walker used. The data counts wages, property income and government assistance as "personal income." We crunched the numbers using that starting point at the end of 2010, the last quarter before Walker took over from Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. The end point was the first quarter 2014, the latest for which data was available. First, there is no "Midwest" category in the agency’s geographical breakdowns. Two of the regions the agency uses include states often associated as Midwestern peers for the Badger State. One is the "Great Lakes" region (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio). The other is the "Plains" region: (Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota). Here's what we found: State Personal Income growth since 4th quarter 2010 Rank among 50 states North Dakota 32.81% 1 Iowa 15.70% 10 Nebraska 15.23% 11 South Dakota 13.53% 18 Ohio 13.42% 19 Kansas 12.61% 31 Indiana 12.48% 33 Minnesota 12.29% 34 Michigan 12.01% 37 Illinois 11.73% 39 Missouri 10.91% 43 Wisconsin 10.87% 44 By comparison, in Doyle’s last term, which coincided with the Great Recession, Wisconsin ranked 7th of the 12 states and ranked 26th nationally, one point above the U.S. average. When we asked the Bureau of Economic Analysis if the 2010 starting point makes sense for judging 2011 and forward, spokesman Thomas Dail said it was correct to use the fourth quarter of 2010 as the baseline. That allows a comparison of the pre-Walker income level to Walker’s first full year in office, 2011 and forward, he said. We asked three experts to examine the BEA figures. They were Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management; Laura Dresser, a labor economist and associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy; and Dale Knapp, research director at Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. All three cautioned that comparing quarters can lead to distortions -- and we noted that the last quarter before Walker saw an unusually large jump in personal income. That was due in part to an early shift in Medicaid payments to that quarter, the Walker campaign correctly points out. The statistical effect is a bigger starting point for Walker, meaning any gains on his watch look smaller than they would otherwise. Another defensible starting point is the first quarter of 2011, our experts said, which takes in Walker’s first three months. But that distorts in the other direction because the Medicaid payments -- having been shifted earlier -- look much lower. Using that baseline, Wisconsin’s growth was second-best in the Midwest. The Walker campaign doesn’t argue for using the 2011 base. They, and our experts, prefer to look at annual growth rates which smooth out the volatility you see in quarterly data. From 2010 to 2013, we found Wisconsin ranked 9th of the 12 Midwest states. To be sure, anomalies pop up in the numbers once in a while due to governmental policies. In his claim of "We’re #1," Walker reached back one year from the latest quarter to a quarter that saw the biggest single-quarter loss in personal income in three years. That of course made the state look better in the comparison he chose. The loss was partly due to Washington’s "fiscal-cliff legislation," which served to artificially boost incomes in late 2012, thereby depressing personal income in the quarter that was Walker’s one-year base. And partisans pick the presentation that best makes their case -- in this case, both Walker and his critics chose to compare quarterly figures rather than annual rates. Walker could have chosen an annual comparison -- 2012 to 2013, which is the most recent for which a full calendar year is available. But by that measure Wisconsin is middle of the pack on growth. There’s no one right way, our experts said. "I think it is perfectly honest and accurate to say income grew 10.9 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2014," Jacobsen said, referring to the comparison that shows Wisconsin last in the Midwest. Our rating After Walker correctly pointed out that personal income growth is the best in the Midwest for the last year, commentators alleged that Wisconsin is "dead last in income growth" during Gov. Scott Walker’s three-plus years in office. The quarterly figures do put Wisconsin at the bottom, based on the starting point endorsed by the agency that compiled the information. Reader beware: Any such quarterly comparison has its flaws, as we’ve seen in these related claims. But by the numbers, the blogosphere’s claim is on target. We rate it True.

pomt-15205	"A minor cannot get a tattoo without parental consent but can get an abortion without parental consent."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-minor-can-get-abortion-not-tattoo/	Teenagers getting inked is apparently subject to greater parental say than getting an abortion, according to U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. In an Aug. 4 interview with Southern Baptist Convention President Russell Moore, Rubio joined other Republicans in criticizing Planned Parenthood amid the release of videos by an anti-abortion group that accuse the group of harvesting fetal tissue for profit. A day earlier, Florida’s Republican senator had been among those who voted to defund Planned Parenthood, a measure that failed to get the required 60 votes to advance. In his interview, Rubio raised concerns about nationwide access to abortions for minors: "The idea that a minor can go get a tattoo," he said, before quickly correcting himself to say "cannot get a tattoo without parental consent -- but can get an abortion without parental consent -- is just mind-shattering for the vast majority of Americans. ... People who believe that a young child, a minor, should be able to get an abortion easier than a tattoo -- they are the extremists." We decided to check whether minors need their parents’ permission to get a tattoo, but don’t need permission to get an abortion. Parental consent laws First, the laws about parental consent for abortion and tattoos vary from state to state, so it’s not possible to make a blanket statement as Rubio did and apply it to the whole country. According to data through March 2015 compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 45 states have laws prohibiting minors from getting tattoos, with the majority of those states allowing it if there’s parental consent. For example, Florida law requires written, notarized consent of a minor's parent or legal guardian in order to tattoo a minor. Now let’s look at whether minors need their parents’ permission to obtain an abortion. There are two different categories of parental involvement: one is consent, which means a parent has to sign off on the abortion, while the other one is simply notification which can mean the parent receives a letter or a phone call about the abortion. According to Guttmacher Institute, a group that tracks abortion policy and statistics, a majority of states require consent and/or notification. In 38 states, minors either have to get consent and/or notify their parents, while in 12 states they don’t need either. We asked Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, which states require parental consent for a tattoo but not for an abortion. Using information from Planned Parenthood about abortion laws and the National Conference of State Legislatures about tattoo laws, Conant pointed to seven states: State Abortion law for minors Tattoo law for minors California No parental involvement required It is a misdemeanor to tattoo anyone under age 18. Connecticut No parental involvement required Requires permission of parent or guardian. Hawaii No parental involvement required Requires written consent of parent or guardian Maine No parental involvement required It is illegal to tattoo anyone under age 18. Montana No parental involvement required Requires explicit in-person consent of the child's parent or guardian. New York No parental involvement required It is unlawful to tattoo the body of a child less than 18 years old. Vermont No parental involvement required Requires written consent of his or her parent or guardian. Sources: Planned Parenthood and the National Conference of State Legislatures Conant included two states that flat-out ban tattoos for minors: California and Maine. So that leaves five states that require parental consent for tattoos but have no parental involvement required for abortions. However, Rubio used the more narrow term of "parental consent" in his interview -- not "parental involvement" or "notification." There are some states that require only parental notification for abortion but do require consent for tattoos -- for example Florida. So that means that a Florida teenager doesn’t need her parents’ permission to get an abortion -- but does for a tattoo. State Abortion law Tattoo law Colorado Parental notification only Requires express consent from the minor's parent or guardian. Delaware Parental notification only Requires prior written consent of the adult parent or legal guardian. Florida Parental notification only Requires written, notarized consent of a minor's parent or legal guardian in order to tattoo a minor. Minnesota Parental notification only Requires written parental consent. South Dakota Parental notification only Requires signed consent form from the minor's parents West Virginia Parental notification only Requires prior written consent from a parent or guardian Source: Guttmacher Institute and National Conference of State Legislatures So in all, Rubio has a point for about 11 states. Complicating matters is that there is a way to avoid parental involvement. Since the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states may not give parents an absolute veto over whether their daughters have an abortion, 37 states that require parental involvement include a "judicial bypass" procedure. This allows a minor to receive court approval for an abortion without her parents’ knowledge or consent. Use of judicial bypass could increase the number of states where Rubio’s scenario would be valid. A spokeswoman for Americans United for Life, told PolitiFact that "even in states with the most stringent parental consent requirements, a minor who can demonstrate (with the assistance of free counsel) to a court that she is either mature enough to make an abortion decision, or that obtaining parental consent is not in her best interest, can bypass the parental consent requirement." However, it’s worth noting that, despite the existence of judicial bypass, a majority of pregnant minors who seek abortion report that their parents are aware that they are doing so, according to a literature review by Guttmacher in 2009. Helena Silverstein, a government and law professor at Lafayette College who wrote a book in 2007: "Girls on the Stand: How Courts Fail Pregnant Minors," suggested that rather than compare parental consent for tattoos to abortion, it is more useful to compare other minors’ consent law as they relate to sexual and reproductive health. All states allow minors to consent to get treatment for sexually transmitted infections while 32 states allow minors to consent to prenatal care without their parents’ permission. J. Shoshanna Ehrlich, an expert on reproductive rights at the University of Massachusetts, was also skeptical of Rubio’s comparison. While it "must suck to be 16 and wait until you are 18 to get a tattoo, you can postpone the decision," unlike abortion, she said. Our ruling Rubio said "a minor cannot get a tattoo without parental consent but can get an abortion without parental consent." Rubio has a good argument for about 11 states, but that’s a minority. More commonly, parents by law need to be at least notified -- and in many cases give their consent -- for a minor to have an abortion. There is a significant exception, however: 37 states allow a minor to go through a judge without notifying parents. As for tattoos, most states either ban them for minors or require parental consent.

pomt-12359	Says an Internet meme shows people rejoicing over the Paris agreement.	false	/florida/statements/2017/jun/07/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-facebook-meme-climate-accord-uses-unre/	It’s clear that Sarah Palin hates the Paris climate agreement. What’s unclear is why she used a photo of Florida lawmakers to make her point in a Facebook meme. "Don’t be fooled! The Paris climate accord is a scam," stated the headline at the top of Palin’s Facebook post June 6, 2017. (By June 7, the Facebook meme was no longer available but PolitiFact had taken a screenshot of her post, which had been shared at least 8,000 times.) Beneath the headline is a photo of an unidentified group of mostly men cheering. The Facebook post doesn’t identify the people in the photo, but they are Florida House members at the state Capitol in Tallahassee. Beneath the photo Palin shared is text that says: "They pretend it’s about fixing our environment ... But it’s really about stealing billions from the American people and giving it to foreign countries, governments and lobbyists!" The Facebook meme, posted after President Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement, could leave the impression that the people in the photo are rejoicing over using the agreement to steal billions from Americans. That's not the case. PolitiFact fact-checked Palin’s photo as part of our effort to debunk fake news on Facebook. Our efforts to reach a spokesperson for Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, were unsuccessful. (Palin’s post was previously debunked by other news outlets including the Miami Herald, a partner along with the Tampa Bay Times in PolitiFact Florida, and Politico.) Real origin of the photo: Florida The photo is actually from the 2011 Florida legislative session. We interviewed four of the Republican politicians in the photo: state Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, and former House members Will Weatherford, a former speaker from Wesley Chapel; Chris Dorworth of Lake Mary, and Rachel Burgin of Riverview. We also interviewed a Democrat in the photo: Jeff Clemens, now a state senator of Lake Worth. Not all of the legislators recalled the particulars of the photo, but all of them said that their cheers had nothing to do with the Paris climate accord -- which was signed years later -- or about climate change. Plakon directed us to search the Florida House website to show the real reason behind the cheering. The website showed that the photo was taken by House photographer Mark Foley. The cutline states: "From the left, Speaker-designate Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, signaled that session was coming to a close as members celebrate on the House floor, May 7, 2011." Plakon recalled some late night (which led to early morning) back-and-forth maneuvering between the House and the Senate in the final hours of that session. "It was a famous night," Plakon said. The final hours of the 2011 legislative session on Saturday, May 7, were chaotic, according to a Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times timeline. As the hours stretched on, lawmakers played songs such as "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help" by the Beatles and "The Final Countdown" on the public speaker. At 11:30 p.m. after the House unanimously rejected a Senate bill related to rules for the state-run Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the chamber erupted into cheers and shouts of, "It’s us versus the Senate." At 1 a.m., senators went home. At 2 a.m., the House passed a bill that included tax cuts and adjourned as Handel's Hallelujah chorus played on the public address system. Minutes later the senators had to return -- looking tired. One member came in wearing no shoes, another with no socks and a third in jeans and a T-shirt. The session finally ended at 3:35 a.m. We were unable to confirm by deadline with House officials exactly what time Foley’s photo was taken during the conclusion of the session. But some of the members recalled the image from the conclusion of the session. "We were all clapping because it was finally finished," Burgin said. She described the situation as "humorous" but said it was a bad choice for Palin to use a 2011 photo of the Florida House for a post about the 2015 climate accord. "It's kind of bad taste to label Florida legislators as being involved in that, especially in 2011," she said. "Everybody and their brother has been tagging me since it published, it’s kind of funny." Many of the legislators got a chuckle about the use of the photo in Palin’s meme. Plakon, a publisher of a website used by insurance claims professionals, quipped, "As a publisher I object to the use of low-resolution graphics." For the record, Burgin said she has no opinion on the climate accord. Weatherford declined to express his opinion. Plakon called the accord a "bad deal" and sided with Trump’s position. Dorworth, who lost an election in 2012, said he didn’t support the Paris accord. "Most of the persons in that picture probably would not have supported the Paris climate accord either," he said. Clemens, the Democrat, was the only lawmaker we interviewed who told us he supports the climate accord. "Of course I support the world coming together to solve serious problems. Who wouldn’t?" Our ruling Palin posted a viral image that purportedly shows a group of people clapping as a result of the Paris agreement, presumably about the billions they will earn. Except, it’s not that at all. The photo is of Florida lawmakers elated at the long-awaited close of the 2011 legislative session. The text and photo pairing is inaccurate. We rate it False.

pomt-02574	Nearly 90% of Travis County government races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/30/wayne-thorburn/only-3-republicans-19-travis-county-races/	If you think most of Travis County’s next batch of elected leaders will be chosen in November, you’re wrong, according to Wayne Thorburn. The Austinite, a former director of the Republican Party of Texas whose book "Red State: An Insider’s Story of How the GOP Came to Dominate Texas Politics" comes out this spring, wrote in a Jan. 8, 2014, opinion column for the Austin American-Statesman: "There are 27 county government offices up for election in 2014. Of these, only three have the potential of being settled in the November election. ... Nearly 90 percent of all county races will be settled by the time of the Democratic primary" on March 4, 2014. Travis County’s pretty blue, as Thorburn noted and as PolitiFact Texas explored in a recent fact-check of U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett’s claim that its surrounding counties are red (True). Is it so blue that most of the county’s votes cast in the Nov. 4 election won’t really decide anything? By email, Thorburn pointed us to the state elections website and said, "Please realize that I did not say 90 percent of all races that will appear on the November ballot in Travis County (which would include state, multi-county district, and state legislative positions). What I specifically said is county offices, including county judge, commissioners from precincts 2 and 4, several justices of the peace, and several county court at law positions." The only assumption he made, Thorburn said, is that no Libertarian or Green Party candidates will win. "The secretary of state's web site does not include any Libertarian or Green Party candidates who may be nominated by a convention, rather than a primary," he said. County elections official Michelle Parker guided us by phone to a breakdown of races on the county’s election website. Next, from the state secretary’s elections web page of candidates who filed for the primary by the Dec. 9, 2013 deadline, we pulled the Travis County names. After setting aside the candidates for Congress, governor and other federal or state offices, we came up with 32 candidates running in 19 races and only three Republicans in the lot. District Judge 201st District Court Amy Clark Meachum DEM District Judge 250th District Court Karin Crump DEM District Judge 419th District Court Orlinda Naranjo DEM County Judge Andy Brown DEM County Judge Sarah Eckhardt DEM County Judge Mike McNamara REP County Court At Law Judge #1 Todd Wong DEM County Court At Law Judge #2 Eric Montgomery Shepperd DEM County Court At Law Judge #3 John Lipscombe DEM County Court At Law Judge #3 Paul Evans DEM County Court At Law Judge #4 Mike Denton DEM County Court At Law Judge #5 Nancy Hohengarten DEM County Court At Law Judge #6 Brandy Mueller DEM County Court At Law Judge #7 Elisabeth Earle DEM County Probate Court Judge Guy Herman DEM District Clerk Velva L. Price DEM County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir DEM County Treasurer Dolores Ortega Carter DEM County Treasurer Ramey Ko DEM County Commissioner Precinct 2 Raymond Frank REP County Commissioner Precinct 2 Brigid Shea DEM County Commissioner Precinct 2 Garry Brown DEM County Commissioner Precinct 2 Richard Jung DEM County Commissioner Precinct 4 Darla Wegner DEM County Commissioner Precinct 4 Margaret J. Gomez DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 1 Yvonne M. Williams DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 2 Randall Slagle DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 2 Glenn Bass REP Justice of the Peace Precinct 3 Susan Steeg DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 4 Raul Arturo Gonzalez DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 5 Herb Evans DEM Justice of the Peace Precinct 5 James Braxton Forrest DEM After we inquired, Thorburn said he had miscounted the number of races, and now tallied 19. "The percentages are still valid if 84.2 percent is acceptable as "nearly 90 percent,’ " he said. Travis County Republican Party spokesman Andy Hogue confirmed by email that three Republicans are running for three Travis County offices, though he pointed out that more are bidding for offices Thorburn did not include: state House districts 47 and 50, both within the county’s boundaries. Most Travis County candidates are, so far, unopposed, so that unless a Green or Libertarian files, Democrats are set to claim 12 offices without having to campaign for them. Four more races will be settled in the Democratic primary in March (unless a Green, independent or Libertarian files) because they feature two Democrats facing off: county treasurer; county commissioner Precinct 4; county court at law judge No. 3; and justice of the peace Precinct 5. The three races with a Republican contender: county judge, Precinct 2 county commissioner and Precinct 2 justice of the peace. Our ruling Thorburn said "nearly 90 percent" of the Travis County government races this year will be settled by the March Democratic primary, thanks to the paucity of Republicans who filed to run. His declared count was too high. Still, 16 out of 19 races for county office lack a Republican candidate, which suggests that 84 percent of the positions will be all but settled once the primaries are over.

pomt-03854	Georgia has the most lax gun laws in the nation.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/13/donzella-james/gun-law-claim-goes-awry/	PolitiFact Georgia is usually interested when an elected official claims the Peach State is first or worst in a particular category. State Sen. Donzella James, a Democrat who represents portions of Douglas and Fulton counties, had us listening closely when she made a specific statement about guns and Georgia. The lawmakers were discussing Senate Bill 101, which would allow Georgians as young as 18 to be granted a gun license if they’ve completed basic military training, as long as the person has not been dishonorably discharged. The bill also would eliminate a ban on guns in public housing, unless required by federal law or regulation. Senate Bill 101 passed by a 41-10 margin and is now in the hands of the House of Representatives. James had serious concerns about the bill and went into the well to speak in front of her colleagues. "We know that Georgia has the most lax laws (for) carrying guns," said James, a self-described gun owner, who prefaced her remarks by saying she hadn’t planned to speak. James was referring to Georgia’s gun laws in general, not just permits to carry firearms. We wondered: Does Georgia have the most lax gun laws in America? Some gun control organizations regularly rank each state based on its gun laws. The most prominent group, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, gave Georgia an 8 on a scale of 100 in terms of the toughness of its gun laws in 2011. Liz Flowers, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Senate Democrats, sent us a link to that report. To clarify, 8 is not considered a good score as far as gun control advocates are concerned. Georgia received points for not allowing guns on college campuses, requiring a license, record-keeping and retention and police inspections. For those who are distressed by Georgia’s score, take comfort. Twenty-seven states received lower scores than Georgia that year. Alaska, Arizona and Utah received not one point. In 2009, the Brady Campaign also gave Georgia a score of 8. There were nearly 20 states that received a lower score. The National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action has been unimpressed with the Brady rankings. It notes only a handful of states receive passing marks from Brady and say states that score high have higher crime rates. The NRA complains the Brady Campaign gives points to states with gun laws that supplement federal gun laws. Another group, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, gave Georgia a D for the toughness of its gun control laws. Again, many states did far worse. Twenty states received a grade of F from the group. The center gives best practices for policies such as laws prohibiting gun dealers from residential areas, laws requiring a license to purchase ammunition and those that require gun safety training. UCLA Law School professor Eugene Volokh, who has been writing and teaching about U.S. gun laws for several years, says it is difficult to completely determine which states have the most lax gun laws because there are so many ways to examine the claim. For example, he said, it can be examined by the types of weapons permitted in each state. Some criteria he prefers are examining how easy it is to carry a concealed gun or at what age you can get a permit. Four states -- Alaska, Arizona, Vermont and Wyoming -- allow law-abiding adults to carry a concealed firearm without a permit, The Washington Post noted. The Post also reported that Vermont allows people as young as 16 to buy a handgun. Georgia laws are not as permissive, Volokh observed. "Georgia is not the most gun-friendly state in the nation, but probably not the most hostile, either," Volokh said. So where does this all leave us? The senator said, "We know that Georgia has the most lax laws (for) carrying guns." From our review, Georgia is considered to have some lax gun laws. It’s possible from some of the changes proposed, Georgia could score lower in the future. But, for now, there are other states that are far more permissive. We rate James’ claim False.

pomt-15312	"In a few months, this deal would give Iran $150 billion" for its $300 billion to $400 billion economy, which is "like $8 trillion flowing into the United States treasury."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/17/ron-dermer/israeli-ambassador-uses-odd-logic-relate-irans-fro/	While President Barack Obama has hammered the point that the sole goal of the nuclear accord with Iran was to prevent it from building a bomb, many of America’s allies in the region are at least as concerned about a more immediate threat. They fear that an economic revival in Iran would allow it to build its military and boost its funding of proxy fighters who oppose Israel and key Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia. Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, raised that issue July 13, 2015, at a major gathering in Washington of Christians United for Israel, an evangelical group. "That deal will not bring peace closer. It will bring war closer — making conventional war more likely today and the horrors of nuclear terrorism more likely tomorrow," Dermer said. He posted the speech on his Facebook page. A short bit later, Dermer talked about the impact of unfreezing Iranian assets. "The promise of phased sanctions relief looks more like a one-time jackpot for the Ayatollah regime," he said. "In a few months, this deal would give Iran $150 billion. Iran has a $300 (billion) to $400 billion economy. A $150 billion infusion of cash into Iran’s coffers is like $8 trillion flowing into the United States treasury." Dermer did not say where he got his numbers or elaborate on his analogy. We asked the Embassy of Israel in Washington to clarify Dermer’s statement but did not hear back. Absent hearing from the source, we assume that the underlying math runs as follows: $150 billion is half of $300 billion (the low end of Dermer’s estimate of Iran’s GDP). The U.S. economy is over $16 trillion ($18.1 billion in 2015), so half of that gives you the $8 trillion Dermer cited. The reality of the deal's effect is much more complicated than Dermer's math lets on. And though there are issues with his numbers, the fundamental flaw is his logic. He treats GDP, which is the sum of all goods and services generated by a nation’s economy, as if it were the same as the government’s bank account. This is sort of like saying your yearly income is the same as your checking account. Most Americans would like that to be true, but it isn’t. The two are completely different, and so are GDP and national treasuries. So even though it would be fair to note that Iran’s state-owned oil company accounts for a huge chunk of the country’s economy, Iran's access to that money is not like the U.S. treasury getting an infusion of $8 trillion. A government and its economy are not one and the same. Dermer would have been on slightly firmer ground if he had said unfreezing Iran's assets would be like injecting $8 trillion into Iran's economy. But he didn't, and the analytic issues don't stop there. There’s also a problem with the numbers Dermer used. There are different ways to estimate Iran’s GDP, but according to the World Bank, Iran’s economy is $415 billion. If we re-do Dermer’s math, that would mean the equivalent impact in the United States — regardless of Dermer’s troubled metaphor — would be about 30 percent lower than he said. It’s also likely that Dermer inflated the size of Iran’s assets that were frozen under sanctions. The U.S. Treasury Department estimates the value of Iran’s foreign currency reserves at $100 billion. An article in Foreign Policy magazine cited $120 billion. We don’t know where Dermer got $150 billion. The Institute of International Finance, a trade association representing banks, insurance companies and other financial entities worldwide, ran its own numbers and settled on $100 billion. Garbis Iradian is the association’s chief economist for Africa and the Middle East. Iradian told us that the money in those overseas accounts does belong to the government of Iran and about two-thirds of it comes from oil sales. Sanctions imposed in 2012 forbid the repatriation of those dollars to Iran. If the deal goes into effect, there will be a delay of at least a few months before Iran’s accounts are unfrozen. First, the International Atomic Energy Agency must certify that Iran is doing what it promised. That certification is being called "Implementation Day," and when that happens, Iran will gain access to its foreign reserves. Does that mean that all of the money will go back to Iran in a great rush? No one knows for sure. Michael Malloy is a law professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento and the author of The Structure of Economic Sanctions to be published next spring by Cambridge University Press. Malloy said the funds smooth the process when Iran needs to buy things on the international market. The hard currency is in place to transfer to the foreign seller. "The Iranians will need those facilities," Malloy said. "Those account relationships will continue and a lot of that money will stay." Iradian said that in theory, Iran could decide to bring all the money home, but he too suspects that is unlikely. While Tehran might tap $10 billion or even $20 billion, Iradian said the money is a hedge against shifts in the international market, especially the price of oil. (A quick term of art: A country’s current account is the balance between money going out for imports, and the money coming in from exports.) "If oil prices drop below $50 a barrel, then the current account of the country will be negative," Iradian said. "How will they finance the gap? They will tap their official reserves." Iradian described the Iranian central bank managers as prudent. "The official reserve is a fall back position," he said. "It’s like you keeping money in your checking account in case you lose your job. For Iran, it has security for whenever it has difficulty meeting its foreign exchange needs." Iradian has written that the lifting of sanctions, of which unfreezing Iranian bank accounts is a part, will provide a major boost to the Iranian economy. Again, the effects on the economy are different from the money in Iran's treasury. Our ruling Dermer said that for an economy the size of Iran, unfreezing $150 billion of Iranian assets would be like pumping $8 trillion into the U.S. treasury. There are several problems with this claim. It exaggerates the value of Iran’s frozen assets, underestimates the size of the Iranian economy, and confuses the concepts of a country’s economy and the money in its treasury. While Iran would gain access to foreign currency reserves worth about $100 billion, it is far from certain that the money would go directly into government spending. On the other hand, an amount of money on that scale would have a significant impact on the nation’s finances. The numbers are off and the logic is flawed, but this statement has an element of accuracy. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13717	Independent analysts "found that Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-donald-trumps-plan-would-add-30-tri/	Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., criticized Donald Trump’s fiscal proposals during his debut convention speech as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Independent analysts, Kaine said, "found Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt." We’ll take a look at this statement in two parts. Trump ‘would rack up $30 trillion in debt’ As we have previously reported, this figure originated in an analysis from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that, among other things, regularly analyzes the broader economic effects of presidential candidates’ tax proposals. In its report, the center found that "including interest costs, the proposal would add $11.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $34.1 trillion by 2036." This estimate assumes no major spending cuts would be made, which tracks with the historical pattern, the authors said. The Clinton campaign also noted that Trump has not specified any cuts to offset his plan. So Kaine has a point that the $30 trillion-plus figure has been used by an independent organization. Still, it’s worth noting a couple caveats. • That analysis uses a 20-year time frame. When groups like the Tax Policy Center analyze the budgetary impact of policy proposals, they typically use a fixed "window" of time to measure the effects. Usually, it’s a 10-year window. In this case, the center offered both a 10-year window and a somewhat more unconventional 20-year window. Over 10 years, the center projected, Trump’s policies would increase the debt by $11.2 trillion. Over 20 years, they would increase the debt by $34.1 trillion. So Kaine, like Clinton before him, cherry-picked the biggest number for his talking point — a figure that was three times as big, and which used an unconventional window of time. • Kaine overlooked a study with a smaller projected debt increase. Another study of Trump’s policies, by the economic forecasting firm Moody’s, offered three scenarios, depending on whether one takes Trump’s policy proposals at face value, whether he enacts them with some compromises, or whether he ends up unable to enact much of his agenda. All the scenarios look at the impact of the resulting policies over 10 years. The first scenario produces additional debt of $9.7 trillion above current policies. The second produces a debt increase of $6.9 trillion above current policies. And the last produces a debt increase of less than $1 trillion above current policies. That final scenario is about 3 percent of the amount Kaine cited in the speech. ‘Given to the wealthy and big corporations’ The benefits of Trump’s plan skew toward the top of the income heap, independent experts have concluded. As we have noted, Trump’s proposal would consolidate the existing seven income brackets (with rates from 10 to 39.6 percent) into three with rates at 10, 20 and 25 percent. He would also increase the standard deduction from $6,300 to $25,000 for single filers and from $12,600 to $50,000 for joint filers and phase out most itemized deductions, except for charitable giving and mortgage interest. And he would eliminate the estate tax, the alternative minimum tax, the Affordable Care Act taxes, and the marriage penalty. Meanwhile, Trump’s reforms to the corporate tax code would collapse the eight tax brackets ranging from 15 to 35 percent into a flat rate of 15 percent and to tax the foreign income of U.S. companies abroad. While virtually everyone would pay less under the Trump plan, it offers particularly big benefits to the richest taxpayers. The Tax Policy Center calculated that the average tax cuts for the top 1 percent would be $275,000, or 17.5 percent of after-tax income, and for the top 0.1 percent, they would be $1.3 million, or nearly 19 percent of after-tax income. Middle-income households, meanwhile, would get a cut of $2,700, or a 4.9 percent reduction. Those making the least would see a cut, too, but only of $128 or so, working out to roughly 1 percent of after-tax income. Our ruling Kaine said that independent analysts "found Trump's tax plan, given to the wealthy and big corporations, would rack up $30 trillion in debt." Kaine is on pretty solid ground with the substance of his assertion, but he’s cherry-picked the biggest figure of several that were available. We rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/af5240d2-cf7d-4c5e-8113-85fdc243c665	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-07-27T22:40:55	2016-07-27	['None']
pomt-07975	The health care law is "job killing."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/20/eric-cantor/health-care-law-job-killer-evidence-falls-short/	Poll after poll shows Americans' top concerns are the economy and jobs, which explains why Republicans have labeled the health care law as "job-killing." On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a repeal measure that Republicans formally titled the "Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act." It is sponsored by House Republican leader Eric Cantor. We've read a number of critiques that say the law isn't quite the "job killer" that Republicans claim it is, so we wanted to investigate for ourselves and evaluate the evidence. The Republican leadership recently published a document titled, "Obamacare: A budget-busting, job-killing health care law," which cites several pieces of evidence for its job-killing claim: "Independent analyses have determined that the health care law will cause significant job losses for the U.S. economy: the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that the law will reduce the 'amount of labor used in the economy by … roughly half a percent...,' an estimate that adds up to roughly 650,000 jobs lost. A study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the nation's largest small business association, found that an employer mandate alone could lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs, with 66 percent of those coming from small businesses." We first turned to the Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analyses to members of Congress on how legislation will impact the federal budget and the economy as a whole. In August 2010, it published a new outlook that considered the jobs impact of the new health care law. The Republican report is right that the CBO has determined that the law will reduce "the amount of labor used in the economy," but the GOP report leaves out many important qualifiers. The CBO report actually says: "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount—roughly half a percent—primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law." Basically, the CBO is saying that some people right now are working mostly to keep their health insurance. Once they have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The CBO describes this as a "small segment" of the population. And, because the CBO is describing reduced hours rather than lost jobs, it never uses the 650,000 number that the Republican document cites. The Republican extrapolated that number from the CBO's estimate of one-half percent of the labor supply. Finally, we should point out that a person who voluntarily chooses to work less is not having their job "killed" by federal legislation. Now let's turn to the other piece of evidence, the study that claims that the health care law will result in 1.6 million lost jobs. That number comes from a study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. The problem with this study is that it isn't based on the law that passed. It was published on Jan. 26, 2009, before a finalized House or Senate bill had even been proposed. In the NFIB study, "Small Business Effects of a National Employer Healthcare Mandate," the authors made hypothetical assumptions based on what they thought the law might include. Specifically, the study assumed that all companies would be required to offer private health insurance to their employees, and that the employers would have to pay for at least half of the cost of the insurance premiums. "The results indicate that without major reductions in the cost of healthcare, the employer mandate would cause the economy to lose over 1.6 million jobs within the first five years of program implementation. Small firms would be most adversely affected by the mandate and account for approximately 66 percent of all jobs lost," the report said. But the report's assumptions don't match up with the final version of the health care law. The law actually exempts companies with 50 or fewer workers from any mandate, so many of the small firms "most adversely affected" in the NFIB study are not required to offer insurance. According to the study, firms with 19 or fewer jobs accounted for 467,182 of the 1.6 million job losses. Those companies would be exempt from the mandate, so the 1.6 million figure is at least inflated by 467,182. The next category was firms with 20 to 99 employees, estimated to shed 420,600 jobs as a result of a hypothetical employer mandate. Presumably a good percentage of those are companies with 50 or fewer employees, and again, are exempt from the health care law. One of the authors of the NFIB study, Michael J. Chow, acknowledged there are "material differences" between the assumptions made in the study and what actually became law. The NFIB did not produce an updated study based on the realities of what ended up in the health care law. The organization continues to oppose the health care law. "We still have concerns about the employer mandate and the final law in general," Chow said. We should note here that the final law did not include a direct mandate. Rather, it enacted a fairly complicated way to fine employers if any of their workers qualify for new federal tax credits aimed at helping people buy insurance. Health care experts we've interviewed conclude that most large employers will be fined if they do not offer insurance. In evaluating this statement, we should reiterate that the health care law is a complicated piece of legislation. Large employers who do not currently offer insurance or who offer limited coverage will see greater costs under the bill, either because they will have to buy their employees new or additional coverage or they get hit with fines. We asked Cantor's office about whether the bill was "job-killing." A spokesman insisted that it was, pointing to individual business owners who said they would face increased costs under health care. He also pointed us to a letter organized from the American Action Network, a conservative think tank. The letter, signed by 200 economists, said, "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains expensive mandates and penalties that create major barriers to stronger job growth. The mandates will compete for the scarce business resources used for hiring and firm expansion." To be clear, the health care law will cost some employers money, particularly large ones. The CBO says that fines imposed on large employers will affect low-wage workers the most. But it also says the effect will be somewhat limited. We should also note that the major part of the legislation does not go into effect until 2014, and even after that, it will take time for workers and employers to see how it plays out. "To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced," the CBO said in its report. "It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives." Republicans have used the "job-killing" claim hundreds of times -- so often that they used the phrase in the name of the bill. It implies that job losses will be one of the most significant effects of the law. But they have flimsy evidence to back it up. The phrase suggests a massive decline in employment, but the data doesn't support that. The Republican evidence is extrapolated from a report that was talking about a reduction in the labor supply rather than the loss of jobs, or based on measures that weren't included in the final health care law. We rate the statement False.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2011-01-20T11:54:13	2011-01-19	['None']
pomt-09437	"We are the only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/11/dianne-feinstein/feinstein-says-us-only-nation-rely-heavily-profit-/	In February, amid the heated debate over health care reform, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced legislation to bar insurance companies from implementing "unfair" hikes in health plan premiums. In a March 8, 2010, New York Times story, Feinstein explained why she cares so much about the issue. "We are the only industrialized nation that relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care," Feinstein said. "I believe, fundamentally, that all medical insurance should be not-for-profit." We thought it would be worthwhile checking if Feinstein was right that no other nation "relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care." As it turns out, some other countries do have private, for-profit insurance companies operating in their health care sector, and there are some indications that this sector is growing. But the business, legal and regulatory environment in which they operate is quite different than it is in the United States. A good example is the Netherlands. Dutch plans may be either non-profit or for-profit, as in the U.S. But children are fully covered using public funds, and premiums for adults are set at 50 percent of the expected costs, with the remainder paid through a national "risk equalization fund" -- essentially funds collected from the public at large. As a result, health insurers in the Netherlands aren't really able to compete for adult customers on price. By law, insurers must accept and renew all applicants, and a basic package of services must be offered. By contrast, U.S. insurers are free (for now, at least) to reject applicants on the individual market if they have pre-existing conditions, and insurers offer a panoply of plans with different premium levels and benefit packages. So, in the Netherlands, even the for-profit insurers don't typically make much of a profit on their basic health care lines. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, any profit that insurers make on basic services must be plowed back into reducing premiums. So why even call these companies for-profit? In many of the European countries with a for-profit health insurance sector, the companies make their profits not on basic health care -- the kind that Feinstein specifically referred to -- but by up-selling their health care customers on supplemental health coverage, such as dental care, eyeglasses, cosmetic surgery or more luxurious hospital rooms, or other product lines altogether, such as life or homeowner's insurance. "There's no developed country where insurers can make a profit on basic coverage," said T.R. Reid, the author of The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care. "Their mission is to pay for health care, not to pay investors." Maggie Mahar, a fellow who specializes in international health care policy at the Century Foundation, agrees. "I usually say that the U.S. is the only country in the developed world that has chosen to turn health care into largely unregulated, for-profit enterprise," she said. Technically, for-profit companies do provide basic medical care in countries such as the Netherlands, and there's enough of it going on to say that such countries "rely" on those insurers to serve that need. But the profit these companies make -- or at least the vast majority of it -- is made from lines of business other than basic health care. Because there is no official definition of "basic health care" in the U.S. system, it is hard to calculate exactly how much profit American insurers are making off basic services. But whatever it is, most experts expect that it is higher than the margins being made on basic health care by for-profit insurers in other countries. We believe that Feinstein is right that the U.S. for-profit insurance industry's role in basic health care is fundamentally different than what goes on in other countries, and that this outweighs her technical error in saying that no other country relies heavily on a for-profit medical insurance industry to provide basic health care. So we rate Feinstein's statement Mostly True.	None	Dianne Feinstein	None	None	None	2010-03-11T18:35:04	2010-03-08	['None']
pomt-09391	The Associated Press called Charlie Crist's attacks "over the top," "out of context," and "not true."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/25/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-fires-back-charlie-crists-attack-ad/	Hours after Gov. Charlie Crist launched a television ad attacking Marco Rubio, the former House speaker responded with a pair of 15-second TV spots to discredit Crist's claims. The ads -- "Yes," and "Better" -- feature Crist and his now-infamous embrace of President Barack Obama while the two campaigned for the federal stimulus in February 2009. The ads say Crist's attacks are false. The evidence: A March 13, 2010, Associated Press article. The ads claim that the article labeled Crist's attacks "over the top," "out of context," and "not true." "Why is a desperate Charlie Crist attacking Marco Rubio?" a narrator asks. "Can't Florida do better?" We'd expect to hear the phrases "over the top," "out of context," and "not true" from Rubio supporters. But would they come from the AP, a news organization that is well-respected and known for its impartiality? In this case, yes. The Associated Press article, written by its Florida political writer Brendan Farrington, appeared in newspapers and on Web sites across the state on March 12 and 13. The AP sells its content to news organizations across the country. That means Farrington's piece could be edited differently and have a variety of headlines in different publications. The original story was labeled as an analysis, and it appears most newspapers considered the piece as such. On the Miami Herald's Web site, it ran with the headline, "Analysis: Crist's Rubio attacks often go too far." The story, which you can read here, highlights six instances where Farrington says Crist's attacks are questionable: A suggestion that Rubio may have paid for a back wax with Republican Party of Florida American Express card. An accusation that Rubio, while speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, hired 20 aides at $100,000 salaries and spent $500,000 to renovate his office and a cafeteria for legislators. The claim that Rubio is a lobbyist. The charge that Rubio flip-flopped on whether he would have accepted federal stimulus money. Claims about Rubio's spending habits on the state GOP credit card. Charges about Rubio's $900,000 family debt. PolitiFact Florida has addressed several of those Crist attacks, including the lobbyist claim, the claim about accepting federal stimulus money, and the charge about Rubio's GOP credit card. In the AP story, Farrington makes a case that the accusations require asterisks or are overstatements. Farrington writes: "Crist, who calls himself a 'happy warrior,' still smiles, but he is proving he will throw anything and everything at Rubio to try to win what is becoming one of the closest watched races in the country. Many of Crist's attacks are exaggerated, take words out of context, aren't true or over the top. Rubio has also exaggerated or taken out of context some of Crist's statements or actions, but not to the same extent." The paragraph, the second in the story, includes each of the phrases Rubio cites in his television ad -- "out of context," "over the top," and "not true" (the actual wording in the article was "aren't true"). It's worth noting that Crist's new TV ad references only two of the six attacks Farrington focused on in the AP article - about spending of GOP political donations and that Rubio was a lobbyist - and it's unclear from the article how Farrington would describe those specific attacks. In two short television ads, Rubio tries to soften Crist's attacks with the help of the respected and impartial Associated Press. He uses the AP's words correctly to help make his case. We rate his claim True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-03-25T16:38:12	2010-03-24	['Charlie_Crist']
pomt-00673	An audit shows "there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older,"	true	/virginia/statements/2015/may/11/mark-warner/warner-says-millions-social-security-numbers-still/	People die, but their Social Security numbers often linger on. So says U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who recently introduced a bill that would require the Social Security Administration to do a better job of tracking the departed to make sure their federal benefits don’t survive. "The SSA (Social Security Administration’s) Office of the Inspector General reported last month that, according to the agency’s own records, there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older," Warner said in an April 23 news release. That’s more than twice the of population of Chicago -- filled with people at least 112. It’s especially remarkable when you consider that the Gerontology Research Group says it knew of 42 people in the world who were alive last October at 112 or older. Fifteen of them lived in the U.S. The immortal Social Security numbers, Warner said, open avenues for fraudulent benefit claims. We wondered whether the senator’s Social Security figures were correct. Warner’s office pointed us to a March 4 report issued by Patrick O’Carroll Jr., the Social Security Administration’s inspector general. O’Carroll testified about the agency’s death records during a March 16 hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He stated that the agency maintains an electronic record on each person given a Social Security number and is supposed to update it when they die so their number can no longer be used. The agency gets its death information from a variety of sources, such as family members, funeral homes and financial institutions. It maintains a "Death Master File" with nearly 90 million electronic records that’s shared with other federal agencies to prevent erroneous benefits and sold to credit reporting companies to guard against fraud. Sometimes the Social Security Administration prematurely declares people dead, as recently reported on CBS’ 60 Minutes, causing bureaucratic nightmares when those people try to open bank accounts or do myriad other things requiring a valid Social Security number. The agency’s internal auditor found in 2008 that 20,000 people had been wrongly listed as dead. And sometimes the opposite is true, O'Carroll said in his testimony, and the agency fails to take away Social Security numbers from the dead -- even when the agency has been informed of the deaths. It all came to a head a few years ago when O'Carroll’s office learned that a bank reported that a man had opened accounts using the Social Security numbers of two different people -- one born in 1886 and the other in 1893. The auditors did a little research and found that the world’s oldest living man at the time was 112. So they chose the age as the entry point of their investigation. The auditors indeed found, as Warner claimed, that 6.5 million cardholders were listed in Social Security records as being at least 112. All but about 100,000 of the numbers were issued prior to 1972, when the agency started using electronic records. The good news is that the auditors found no instances of people illegally collecting Social Security through one of these old numbers. The bad news is that the potential for abuse is high and, according to the report, "thousands" of the numbers "could have been used" to commit other types of identity fraud. Auditors found that 66,920 of the numbers had been used by people for whom the government received wage reports from 2006 and 2011. One of the numbers appeared on 613 different wage reports. That means people were using the numbers in job applications and 3,873 of the numbers turned up in E-Verify inquiries, an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine whether potential hirees are entitled by immigration laws to work in the U.S. Final notes: If you’re wondering, the verified oldest person in the world at this writing is Jeralean Talley of Michigan, whose 116th birthday is on May 23. The oldest man is Sakari Momoi of Japan, who turned 112 in February. The verified oldest person ever was Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at 122 years, 164 days old. The oldest man was Christian Mortensen of Denmark, who died in 1998 at 115 years, 252 days. Our ruling Warner said the Social Security Administration’s Inspector General found "there are 6.5 million people who have active Social Security numbers who are 112 years of age or older." The audit Warner cites indeed found that there are an implausible 6.5 million active Social Security numbers belonging to people who would be at least 112. We rate Warner’s claim True.

pomt-02951	Says Ken Cuccinelli wants "to eliminate all forms of birth control."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/27/next-generation-climate-action-committee/no-basis-nextgen-claim-cuccinelli-wants-ban-all-co/	As the campaign reaches its final stretch, Democrats and their allies continue to accuse Ken Cuccinelli of holding extreme views on everything from climate change to birth control. NextGen Climate Action Committee, a Democratic-aligned super pac, has fired out a series of mailers during the last two weeks accusing Cuccinelli, among other things, of "wanting to eliminate all forms of birth control." We asked Brian Mahar, a spokesman for the super pac, for proof of the claim. He cited a Sept. 4 editorial in The Washington Post criticizing Cuccinelli’s support of a 2007 bill in the General Assembly that would have extended to human embryos a "right to the enjoyment of life" from the moment of fertilization. The editorial said the failed legislation would have "provided an opening to prohibit common methods of birth control, including the pill and intrauterine devices." The Post editorial, however, made no claim that every form of birth control -- including condoms and spermicides -- would have been banned under the bill. Debate over the impact of legislation that confers personhood from the moment of conception centers on how various forms of birth control work. No one disputes that devices that merely prevent fertilization wouldn’t be affected by personhood laws. The issue is that some forms -- including the intrauterine device, emergency contraception and birth control pills -- may also work by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus. Some people say those methods go beyond mere contraception and are tantamount to causing an abortion. In 2012, as Virginia was debating another personhood measure, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a statement saying laws that bestow rights from the moment of fertilization would restrict contraception choices. The group wrote, "some of the most effective and reliable forms of contraception, such as oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,, and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt ‘personhood’ measures." But the organization’s statement, which was cited in editorial NextGen references, never said all forms of contraception would be banned. It said personhood laws would leave "condoms, natural family planning and spermicides the only legally allowed forms of birth control." In a September Truth-O-Meter, we gave a Half True to Cuccinelli’s statement that he’s never supported legislation that invades contraceptive choices. We noted that while the personhood bills he’s backed never explicitly sought to ban birth control, they could have opened legal avenues to challenge certain forms of contraception. Cuccinelli has repeatedly said he would not seek to restrict contraception. We asked his campaign how he defines birth control but did not receive a clear response. As a state senator in 2003, Cuccinelli voted against a bill that would have specified that contraception that prevents implantation of a fertilized egg is not an abortion. Our ruling NextGen Climate Action Committee says Cuccinelli wants to "eliminate all forms of birth control." The group cites an editorial that said personhood legislation Cuccinelli supported could have fostered legal challenges to types of contraception that prevent the implantation of fertilized eggs. But the editorial made no assertion Cuccinelli wants to ban all birth control devices. Cuccinelli has repeatedly said he has no interest in restricting contraception, which generally works by preventing ovulation or the fertilization of a human egg. NextGen doesn’t have a speck of proof to bolster its incendiary claim that Cuccinelli wants to ban all forms of birth control -- even condoms and spermicides. We rate it Pants of Fire.

pomt-06578	Says that illegal immigrants get a $100,000 break on University of Texas tuition over four years.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-says-illegal-immigrants-get-10000/	The Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Orlando delivered more criticism of Texas Gov. Rick Perry for his stance on offering certain illegal immigrants in Texas the same college tuition that legal residents pay. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney gave a number that especially resonates in Austin: "To go to the University of Texas, if you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount. You know how much that is? That's $22,000 a year." Romney added: "Four years of college, almost $100,000 discount if you are an illegal alien (and) go to the University of Texas." On Tuesday, Romney's campaign featured that debate moment in a web ad hammering Perry on the issue. Conveniently, we recently completed a related fact-check on a claim that Rick Santorum made in the Sept. 12 Republican presidential debate, so we had a few numbers ready to hand. Based on data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the average gap between in-state and out-of-state tuition at Texas public universities in 2011 was $9,800: A non-resident, full-time student would be expected to pay an estimated $17,000 in tuition and fees, while an in-state resident would pay $7,200. That $9,800 is much smaller than the "discount" Romney cited for UT, but the board confirms that UT’s tuition rates are higher than average and the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition is higher. The in-state costs at UT were the second-highest and UT’s out-of-state tuition was the highest among Texas’ 37 public universities that reported 2011 estimates to the board. Romney’s campaign cited U.S. News and World Report UT tuition figures for 2011-12 of $9,794 in-state and $32,506 out-of-state. When we inquired, the coordinating board cited the same figures, rounded, from UT in calculating its averages: $9,800 in-state and $32,500 out-of-state tuition. Those numbers yield a "discount" of $22,700 -- the biggest gap between in-state and out-of-state resident tuition among the 37 Texas public universities that reported 2011 estimates to the board. The next biggest differences: UT-Dallas, $17,026; Texas A&M University, $15,390; and University of Houston-Clear Lake, $10,838. Nearly all the rest report a difference of $9,400 or less. So, Romney’s "discount" of $22,000 for a year at UT holds up, but his extrapolation of "almost $100,000" across four years is a bit dodgier. The real difference (presuming the 2011-12 tuition charges hold for four years) would be $90,800. Probably most college students would find the $9,200 difference to be significant. However, not only is UT one of the most expensive schools Romney could have picked for this example, but very few of the illegal immigrants receiving this tuition break choose to attend UT. To get the in-state rate, illegal immigrants must have a Texas high school diploma or GED, have lived in Texas for at least three years and sign an affidavit of their intention to apply for permanent residency. Only 16,476 students in Texas took this affidavit route in 2010, and only 612 of those — about 4 percent — went to UT, said Dominic Chavez, senior director for external relations with the higher education board. Most of the "affidavit" students in Texas, by far, choose community colleges, he said; 73 percent of the total 16,476 affidavit students did so in 2010. (The breakdown: 4,403 went to public universities; 12,028 chose community colleges; the remaining 45 students went to public health-related institutions, where the average "discount" was $10,800 -- an example is the UT Medical Branch at Galveston.) And for those community college students, the in-state reduction on tuition is smaller: between $1,600 and $2,600. Though the residency requirements and categories differ from those at public universities, the lowest rate for which students (including affidavit students) can qualify is the "in-district" rate. Among the 53 community colleges reporting 2011 estimates to the Texas coordinating board, the average in-district tuition was $2,200; the average out-of-district tuition was $3,200; and the average non-resident (out-of-state) tuition was $4,800. To take a step back and view the big picture: Of 1.3 million college students in Texas in 2010, 1.2 percent (16,476) were illegal immigrants receiving tuition breaks through the affidavit route. (The even bigger picture: Texas’ 1.65 million illegal immigrants made up 6.7 percent of the state’s total population in 2010, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.) Stated another way, only 1 percent of Texas’ illegal immigrants got the in-state rates in 2010. And of those, 73 percent got an average reduction of $2,600 or less; the remaining 27 percent average closer to $10,000 per year. So let’s return to Romney’s statement: "Four years of college, almost $100,000 discount if you are an illegal alien (and) go to the University of Texas." For the 612 affidavit students at the University of Texas last year, Romney’s figure of $22,000 per year is approximately correct, even a bit low; but quadrupling the real average adds up to $90,800 over four years, not $100,000. Not only is that UT tuition break the very highest that Romney could have cited among Texas public universities, it went to only 4 percent of the illegal immigrants who received in-state tuition rates last year. The vast majority of affidavit students in Texas last year got an average in-state tuition reduction of $1,600 to $2,600. If they got that rate for four years, the total "discount" would be $6,400 to $10,400. And that group of 12,028 community college affidavit students made up less than 1 percent of the 1,364,911 college students enrolled in Texas last year. Romney’s $100,000 figure is only $9,200 off the mark for the University of Texas, but with 73 percent of affidavit students receiving $10,400 or less over four years, his choice to use UT as an example gives a skewed representation of the reality of illegal immigrants seeking college education in Texas. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-09-28T06:00:00	2011-09-22	['University_of_Texas_at_Austin']
pomt-09198	Says Gov. Rick Perry is “spending Texans’ hard-earned money to live like Louie XIV.”	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/may/25/boyd-richie/la-bonne-vie-democratic-chairman-says-perry-living/	Boyd Richie, who chairs the Texas Democratic Party, took a fresh swing at Gov. Rick Perry and his sweet state-funded digs, saying in a May 20 e-mail blast: “He’s spending Texans’ hard-earned money to live like Louie XIV.” Quelle horreur--really? Not really, replied Kirsten Gray, the party’s spokeswoman. “It was a humorous analogy, not based in fact,” she told us in an e-mail. We guessed as much. Allow us to have some fun, too, by taking a look back at France's Sun King. First: How did the king, who lived from 1638 to 1715, make it day to day? Like his father before him, biographies suggest, he often was on the move, waging war (the “natural condition of nations” in the era, recapped Nancy Mitford, in her book, “The Sun King”) or hunting while staying in palatial abodes capped by his beloved chateau at Versailles, which he proclaimed the seat of government in 1682. Versailles, of late a spectacular tourist attraction, grew on the king’s watch to include picture-perfect gardens, a theater holding 3,000 spectators, a vast hall of mirrors, hundreds of imported orange trees (many planted indoors in silver tubs)--all of that a far cry from the rustic hunting lodge his father had enjoyed there. That building, which his son preserved, consisted of just (only) (barely) 20 rooms plus a men’s dormitory. Tuneful aspect of the king’s lifestyle: He was seldom without music, awakening each morning to the playing of a live band, according to Mitford. So, how does Perry fare comparatively? We’re unaware of live bands playing as Perry awakens. And the governor doesn’t routinely hunt (though he recently said he shot and killed a coyote during a jog) nor is he known to bounce from palace to palace nor has he declared war -- except on Washington. Then again, Perry incorrectly maintained last year that Texas could secede; his intimation could be seen as war-like. Yet Perry's temporary home, in a gated community in the hills 11 miles southwest of downtown Austin, hardly compares to the spread at Versailles, which Placesinfrance.com describes as having 700 rooms, over 1,200 fireplaces and 67 staircases. PolitiFact Texas noted in April that the monthly rent for the 4,600-square-foot home--where Perry and his wife settled in fall 2007 so the Governor's Mansion could be renovated--is $9,000. This month, the Associated Press reported that total monthly costs for the seven-bedroom, five-bathroom house exceed $10,000, counting rent, utilities and upkeep. The house has a gourmet kitchen, three dining rooms and seven bathrooms, the AP reported. That gives Perry more private thrones with plumbing than the king who, given his times, was limited to chamber pots. The AP's article itemizes various state-covered expenses at the rental home: $18,000 for "consumables" such as household supplies and cleaning products, $1,001.46 in window coverings from upscale retailer Neiman Marcus, a $1,000 "emergency repair" of the governor's filtered ice machine, a $700 clothes rack, and a little more than $70 for a two year subscription to Food & Wine Magazine. Maintenance on a heated pool on the property’s three acres has cost taxpayers at least $8,400, the AP said, and the tab for grounds and lawn maintenance has topped $44,000. All told, taxpayers have spent at least $592,000 for rent, utilities, repairs, furnishings and supplies since Perry moved in. By comparison, the AP noted, the governor's mansion is wholly owned by the state — there is no rent or mortgage to pay. As configured, it has about 9,900 total square feet, but most is public space packed with historic artifacts. Only 2,750 square feet is dedicated to the governor's residence. Perry critics have floated alternative temporary housing ideas. The governor could occupy a mobile home (as Mike Huckabee boasted of doing while governor of Arkansas). Of late, the Texas AFL-CIO offered to rent a manufactured home to the governor for $1 a year. Or Perry could bunker in at a hotel. At the La Quinta Inn at the Texas Capitol, the nightly rate for a suite, starting June 1, would run $120 plus tax, though a room with a standard King bed, plus a refrigerator and microwave, would cost $90 plus tax, according to the assistant general manager, Zina Carter. There's also a pool, the hotel website says; we'll guess it's not heated. Summing up: Louis XIV had it all for his age. He gamboled, he hunted, he warred; lived large. Though Perry’s hardly giving the king a run for his money, he has had a bonanza of a run as well--healthy wife, children, multiple elections with nary a loss. He’s often said he has the world’s best job. We’ll speculate he’s good with his rental quarters. But ça suffit, as they say in France. The Democrats said Richie was joshing. We’ll grant they’re kidders. We rate his statement Pantalon en Feu.	None	Boyd Richie	None	None	None	2010-05-25T23:03:06	2010-05-20	['Rick_Perry', 'Texas', 'Louis_XIV_of_France']
pomt-07621	The state of Wisconsin pays plumbers, engineers and other attorneys "much, much more" than it pays attorneys to represent poor people.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/20/marla-stephens/former-wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-marla-ste/	Who deserves the least sympathy: lawyers, politicians … Illinois toll booth operators? The first group seems to make pretty good coin. But when doing work for the State of Wisconsin, private-practice lawyers who take public defender cases haven’t gotten a raise since 1992. The fact the so-called "private-bar rate" -- $40 an hour -- hasn’t been raised in more than 18 years outraged Marla Stephens, head of the appellate division of the state public defender’s office. Stephens, who lost in the February 2011 primary election for state Supreme Court, raised the issue at a candidates forum on Jan. 27, 2011, saying: "The State of Wisconsin pays attorneys that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour in every other case. The State of Wisconsin pays plumbers that it hires and engineers that it hires much, much more than $40 an hour to do work for the state." OK, we’ll pause here for this acknowledgement: Stephens’ claim was made weeks ago, before that little budget-repair bill from Gov. Scott Walker caught our attention. But her claim still stands and it provides some insight into how the state provides legal representation for poor adults who are facing jail or prison. First, a little background. The Legislature created the state public defender’s office in 1978. Public defenders, who are state employees, represent the indigent in every county in Wisconsin. They mostly handle adult criminal cases, but they also work civil matters such as paternity cases. At the time, the Legislature created a two-tier pay system for private-practice attorneys who put themselves on a list to be assigned cases by the public defender. The hourly rates peaked in 1992 -- $50 for in-court work and $40 for out-of-court work. The current, single rate of $40 an hour has been in place since 1995. Despite the lack of raises, some 1,300 private-practice attorneys take public defender cases. In 2010, they handled 53,380 cases, two-thirds of them criminal, according to Deborah Smith, the assigned counsel division director for the public defender’s office. So that’s the lay of the land. Now let’s examine what Stephens said. Her first claim was: The state pays private-practice attorneys "much, much more than $40 an hour in every other case." We asked Stephens’ campaign manager, Jon Lipshutz, for evidence to support her two claims. On this point, he cited two Milwaukee Journal Sentinel articles. An August 2009 article said a Madison attorney was paid $175 an hour to represent the state in a lawsuit over the state’s registry for same-sex couples. And a July 2010 article said the state paid another Madison attorney up to $665 an hour in a complex insurance case involving the receivership of Ambac Assurance Corp. Obviously, those attorneys were paid far more than $40 an hour -- but their cases were considerably different than the typical public defender case. To get a more comprehensive picture, we went to Carla Vigue, spokeswoman for the state Department of Administration. She said the lowest rate a state agency paid for an outside attorney over the past year was $95 an hour, for legal services to college students. The state Office of Lawyer Regulation, however, pays what is known as the Supreme Court rate of $70 an hour to attorneys it hires to prosecute lawyer misconduct cases. The Supreme Court rate is also used when judges appoint lawyers to cases for any reason. So, the lowest rate we could find that the state pays to lawyers for non-public defender cases is $70 an hour. That’s $30, or 75 percent, more than what the state pays for public defender cases. Stephens’ second claim was: The state pays plumbers and engineers "much, much more than $40 an hour." Lipshutz confirmed that Stephens was referring to plumbers and engineers hired on contract. He referred us to the state’s VendorNet website but did not provide evidence of what the state pays contract plumbers and engineers. We again went to the Department of Administration. Vigue said engineers are paid $80 an hour -- twice the rate paid to private attorneys on public defender cases. Plumbers, meanwhile, are paid the prevailing wage, which varies by county and by the type of job. Vigue provided plumber rates for Milwaukee, Dane and Brown counties. The lowest rate for typical jobs, in Brown County, is $46.69 -- the basic hourly rate of $31.65, plus $15.04 per hour for fringe benefits. So, the state does have a rate it pays for certain plumbing jobs that is lower than the $40 public defender rate -- at least if benefits are not considered in the plumber rate. Of course, Stephens’ larger point is that the amount paid for public defenders should be increased. Two attempts to force this to happen are pending. A March 2010 petition asks the Supreme Court to raise the court-appointed rate to $80 an hour and to index it to inflation. And the 2011-2013 state budget request by the public defender’s office asks that the rate be raised to $70, at an estimated cost of $16.4 million per year. Let’s return to the claim at hand. Attorney Marla Stephens said the state pays hourly rates to most lawyers, as well as to engineers and plumbers, that are "much, much more" than the $40 it pays private-practice attorneys to handle public defender cases. That kind of characterization is subjective. But the rates paid to other attorneys and to engineers are considerably higher. The rate paid to some plumbers is lower, and only when benefits are not included. We rate Stephens’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-13091	"There’s a section in the Constitution called the Emoluments Clause that says no one, nor their spouses, can take money from foreigners. (Hillary Clinton) has to be guilty of 70 or 100 counts just on that one charge."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/nov/06/newt-gingrich/gingrich-hillary-clinton-broke-law-foreign-clinton/	Trump supporter Newt Gingrich says the elite media has "refused to tell the truth" about Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. As an example, Gingrich told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that every foreign gift received or foreign speech made by Hillary or Bill Clinton violates the Constitution. "There’s a section in the Constitution called the Emoluments Clause that says no one, nor their spouse, can take money from foreigners," Gingrich said. "She has to be guilty of 70 or 100 counts just on that one charge." We previously rated a similar claim by Gingrich Mostly False in large part because of the fact that this is a relatively unexplored area of constitutional law. In fact, the clause has never been litigated in the courts. And experts in the field disagree over whether Clinton’s situation is a violation. We’ll tell the truth The Emoluments Clause was designed to prevent the government and its leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free from external influence. The clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads: "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." The clause does ban U.S. government employees from accepting presents or emoluments (salary or compensation) from foreign governments, but it doesn’t say anything about spouses or "foreigners" generally, as Gingrich said in his claim. In terms of gifts, the Clinton Foundation did accept millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments while Clinton was secretary of state. The money was to be used for charitable work. But there is no proven evidence that she, as a person holding office, personally solicited or received such gifts. Hillary Clinton has never received a salary from the foundation, nor did she have an official role in the organization while she was secretary of state. (It does appear that some of her aides, at least, mixed department and foundation business.) "Gingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing," said University of Texas Law professor Stephen Vladeck. "Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they’re formally — and, thus, legally — distinct." Whether Clinton violated the Emoluments Clause through her association with the Clinton Foundation is ambiguous because there are no specific instructions for how to handle foreign government donations to a charity that has ties to a State Department employee. The department’s own rules don’t address this scenario, either. Dave Kopel, a constitutional law professor at Denver University and research director at the libertarian Independence Institute, said he believed the clause’s intentionally broad phrasing about gifts of "any kind whatever," would cover indirect gifts via the foundation. But Gingrich argued it as a certainty, which it most certainly is not. What about Bill Clinton? Gingrich is also wrong to say the Emoluments Clause speaks of spouses. It does not. But there is a corresponding law to the Emoluments Clause, the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act, that says federal government employees and their spouses can face a civil penalty if they accept gifts from foreign governments. But it’s also unproven that Bill Clinton received such gifts. Bill Clinton does not take a salary from the foundation. There are some companies and organizations that have paid him six-figure speaking fees and have also donated to the foundation — including companies with ties to foreign governments. But a government employee’s spouse receiving income from a foreign entity is not directly covered under the Emoluments Clause, nor the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act. A spokesman for Gingrich sent us a Defense Department memo about the Emoluments Clause, but it was directed at employees of that department, not the State Department. Our ruling Gingrich said, "There’s a section in the Constitution called the Emoluments Clause that says no one, nor their spouses, can take money from foreigners. (Hillary Clinton) has to be guilty of 70 or 100 counts just on that one charge." The Emoluments Clause talks about foreign governments, not foreigners, and doesn’t speak of spouses. Whether Hillary Clinton is guilty of violating the Emoluments Clause is unproven. Some experts say the layers of separation between Hillary Clinton and the foundation mean she likely did not violate the Constitution. Others say the clause is so vague that it could be broadly interpreted to include a scenario like the Clinton Foundation. A case has never been argued in court. Gingrich’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cf33ef1-87bf-4133-8c29-44928f7b5ef7	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2016-11-06T17:18:49	2016-11-06	['Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution']
pomt-09085	Georgia has “more illegal aliens than the state of Arizona.”	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/25/jeff-chapman/does-georgia-have-more-illegal-immigrants-arizona/	(Update: The Pew Hispanic Center recently emailed PolitiFact Georgia its latest numbers on “unauthorized immigrants” that update numbers in the original report below. It does not impact our ruling since that was based on numbers from the Department of Homeland Security. The report is entitled: “A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States.” It can be found at http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=107. Pew found California had the greatest number of “unauthorized residents” and estimated that number at between 2.5 and 2.85 million. Arizona came in sixth on the Pew Hispanic Center list with between 475,000 and 550,000 unauthorized immigrant residents. Georgia came in seventh on that list with 425,000 to 500,000.) Cracking down on illegal immigration has become a mega-mantra for Republicans who want to be Georgia’s next governor. That became evident at a June 17 Republican gubernatorial debate, sponsored by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and the Georgia Press Association. The five Republican candidates who showed up for the GOP debate all favored Georgia adopting a get-tough measure like the one passed in Arizona. But candidate Jeff Chapman, a state senator, went further. He stated that Georgia has actually surpassed Arizona in the number of immigrant residents who broke the law to enter the United States. “Georgia having more illegal aliens than the state of Arizona is clearly taking away jobs,” Chapman said at the debate. Georgia, a state in the Deep South, has more illegal immigrants than Arizona, a state that sits on the Mexican border and is at the epicenter of the illegal immigration political storm? We at PolitiFact Georgia were dubious. Chapman made the statement not only at the debate; he repeats it in detail on his campaign Web site. On the site, Chapman states: “Officially, we have 480,000 illegal aliens in the state of Georgia. Officially, Arizona has 460,000.” Georgia is, of course, a much bigger state, population-wise, than Arizona. It has a total population of 9.8 million residents, while Arizona has about 6.6 million residents. To check the numbers of illegal immigrants, we first went to the Pew Hispanic Center, which keeps a wide array of statistics on illegal immigration. Pew’s Web site numbers indicated California had the greatest number of illegal residents and estimated that number at between 2.5 million and 2.7 million. Arizona came in fifth on the Pew list with between 400,000 and 450,000 illegal immigrant residents. Georgia came in seventh on that list with 350,000 to 450,000. But there was a problem with the Pew numbers. They were from 2005, nearly five years old. We also checked the Web site Statemaster.com, which listed Georgia seventh with 228,000 illegal immigrants and Arizona sixth with 283,000. But those numbers turned out to be 10 years old, based on a report done in 2000. So we called a Washington-based organization known as FAIR -- Federation for American Immigration Reform. Spokesman Jack Martin said their numbers show Arizona ranks sixth with 500,000 and Georgia seventh with 495,000. But Martin said the latest numbers are kept by the Department of Homeland Security. And he recommended we contact that agency for the most updated information. That sentiment was echoed by Tom Edwards of the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau, he said, just keeps numbers on immigrants who live in the U.S., with no distinction of their legal or illegal status. If you want the most updated numbers, Edwards said, go to the Department of Homeland Security. So we did. What we found was a report titled: “Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: January 2009.” It was authored by Michael Hoefer, Nancy Rytina and Bryan C. Baker. The report said its estimate began with the American Community Survey (ACS) of the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates the total foreign-born residents in the U.S. From that report, using various filters, the DHS estimated the number of illegal residents. It’s a bit art, a bit science. And even the report itself cautioned that estimating the number of illegal residents is a slippery business. “Annual estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population are subject to sampling error in the ACS and considerable nonsampling error because of uncertainty in some of the assumptions required for estimation,” the report cautioned. Still, it is a highly regarded number by those in the business of counting people. And it comes up with some interesting conclusions. “The greatest percentage increases in the unauthorized population between 2000 and 2009 occurred in Georgia [115 percent], Nevada [55 percent], and Texas [54 percent],” the report noted. The DHS report still listed California in the top spot, with 2.6 million illegal immigrants. But it placed Georgia at the No. 6 spot with 480,00 illegal residents and Arizona seventh with 460,000. Interestingly, just 10 years ago, Arizona was far ahead with 330,000 illegal immigrant residents while Georgia had only 220,000. Chapman appears to have done his homework on this subject.

pomt-10232	"Governor Palin is the most popular governor in the country."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/03/john-mccain/she-wins-popularity-contest/	In a press release responding to a story in the National Enquirer, the McCain campaign declared that "Governor Palin is the most popular governor in the country." It's a line that has clearly become a campaign talking point — repeated by staffers and supporters alike such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. If the limit of your interest on this issue is whether it's true that Palin is an extremely popular governor in Alaska, we'll save you some time: the answer is an unqualified yes. But we wanted to find out if she is the most popular, as the McCain campaign said. That's a more complicated — and ultimately squishy — issue. You won't find a poll that on one day asked a large sample of residents in every state to rate their governor. What you have is a hodgepodge of polls taken on different days in different states, often asking people different versions of whether they like their governor. For example, you might have one poll asking simply whether they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the governor; and another that asks you to rate the guv's performance as excellent, good, fair or poor. It'd be unfair to compare those head-to-head. And not to make your head hurt, but there's a difference between personal approval ratings and job approval ratings. Bill Clinton, for example, had high job approval ratings but low personal approval ratings. So what do we know about Palin's approval ratings among Alaskans? They are remarkably high. A May 2007 poll taken by Ivan Moore Research in Alaska put Palin's positive rating at 89 percent. That's off the charts high. But Moore's survey wasn't a traditional approval rating or job performance measure. Rather, respondents were asked to rate their feelings toward public figures as very or somewhat positive or very or somewhat negative. The verys and somewhats were then combined. A poll two weeks before that one, from Dittman Research, gave Palin a 93 percent approval rating. The Moore poll numbers hit a low of 76 percent in mid July — in the midst of "Troopergate" coverage — but bounced back to 80 percent in mid August. That mirrored a Hays Research Group poll on July 24 and 25 in which 80 percent rated Palin's performance as somewhat or very favorable. Moore hasn't polled similar questions in other states, so he wouldn't say categorically that Palin's are the highest in the country. "But it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know 89 percent is going to be at the top of the list," Moore said. On Sept. 3, the McCain campaign released results of an American Viewpoint poll on Sept. 2 — after the announcement of Palin as McCain's running mate — that found Palin had an 86 percent overall job approval rating. That was a poll commissioned by the McCain campaign, so take that for what it's worth. Again, these are extraordinarily high numbers by any measure. But according to Rasmussen polls, Palin gave up her crown as "most popular" in July, overtaken by North Dakota's Gov. John Hoeven. A Rasmussen poll on July 30 found 64% of voters rate Palin's job performance as excellent or good versus 14% who view it as poor. On July 8, Hoeven clocked 72 percent at excellent or good against just 6 percent who rated his performance as poor. Scott Rasmussen, founder and CEO of Rasmussen Reports, said people shouldn't get hung up on whether someone ranked No. 1 or 2. Those numbers change with the political winds of the day. "In a broader sense, she (Palin) is one of the very top," Rasmussen said. The polling firm SurveyUSA has in the past conducted governor's approval ratings in all 50 states, but not since Palin took office. In 2006, the highest ratings were around 80 percent. The ratings being reported in Alaska for Palin are "extraordinarily high," said Jay Leve, editor of SurveyUSA. "Those kinds of numbers are unprecedented." And based on the previous highs for approval ratings, he said, it's highly likely Palin is now top dog. Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor for The Cook Political Report, and John McIntyre, managing editor at Real Clear Politics — two groups that pay close attention to such things — also believe Palin's numbers rank her as the most popular. "It's difficult to make a categorical statement like that," McIntyre said. "But generally, they are on pretty solid ground. If I was a betting person, I bet that's an accurate statement. Once your approval rating is over 80 percent, it's a little silly." Bottom line, most experts say the McCain campaign is probably right. We rate it True.

pomt-04613	"Portland Schools spend $500K to deem PB&J sandwiches racist."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/18/education-action-group/portland-schools-spending-half-million-dollars-dec/	This is something PolitiFact Oregon never thought we’d have to do: Search online for the terms racist sandwich. And what pops up? A Portland Tribune news story about a Portland Public Schools equity program that focuses on diversity as a way to boost student learning. We repeat the first four paragraphs of the story as is: Verenice Gutierrez picks up on the subtle language of racism every day. Take the peanut butter sandwich, a seemingly innocent example a teacher used in a lesson last school year. "What about Somali or Hispanic students, who might not eat sandwiches?" says Gutierrez, principal at Harvey Scott K-8 School, a diverse school of 500 students in Northeast Portland’s Cully neighborhood. "Another way would be to say: ‘Americans eat peanut butter and jelly, do you have anything like that?’ Let them tell you. Maybe they eat torta. Or pita." The online response has been tremendous. From Huffington Post: "Peanut Butter And Jelly Racist? Portland School Principal Ties Sandwich To White Privilege." And from WTBX/FM in Hibbing, Minn: "PBJ- the racist sandwich?" (Summary: Yup. Your childhood staple is guilty of hate crimes against humanity.) Even the liberal Daily Kos weighed in with "Oregon school principal: Peanut Butter sandwiches RACIST?" and complained of political correctness gone amok. And here, posted on conservative breitbart.com: "Portland Schools spend $500K to deem PB & J sandwiches racist." We acknowledge some level of hyperbole. But we still wanted to know: Did the principal in question declare the sandwich racist? And did Portland Schools spend half a million dollars to do so? The article posted on breitbart was written by the Education Action Group, a Michigan-based organization that dislikes public unions. We called and got Ben Velderman, a communications specialist who wrote the story. Velderman said he doesn’t know if the principal actually called the sandwiches racist -- which the headline claims. But he points to The Portland Tribune news article, which clearly talks about race and the privilege of the white mainstream. "So if a peanut butter sandwich is the ‘subtle language of racism,’ I don’t think it’s a stretch that she thinks a peanut butter sandwich is racist," he said. "I try not to be inflammatory. I try to keep it as reasonable as possible, by not making outlandish claims. She went out on a limb herself." Gutierrez declined to speak with PolitiFact Oregon, but Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby answered questions on her behalf. He said she did not use the word "racist" in a meeting with staff cited in the news article. He said that the "subtle language of racism" phrase included in the story was the reporter’s wording, and not hers. The point of the example, Shelby said, was to encourage teachers to widen their range of food samples to include more students. "It’s not that the PB&J sandwich is racist. That’s silly," he said. The reporter "asked her about the goal of this work and what her desire was, and she told her that it was to have culturally relevant instruction in every classroom, and what that might look like. "The work is not to point fingers and figure out what is racist." In other words, accusing the sandwich of oppression is quite different from saying that it would be useful to include other foods when talking to students who don’t eat sandwiches for lunch. Let’s turn briefly to the money involved. Portland Public Schools has an ongoing contract with Pacific Educational Group, whose founder is author of the book, "Courageous Conversations About Race: A Strategy for Achieving Equity in Schools." The district has spent more than $1 million since 2007 for diversity and equity training in the classroom. In other words, it’s for more than just the rebranding of a sandwich. (Tigard-Tualatin and other districts use the program as well.) How fair is it for pundits to take a news story that includes the word racism in the first paragraph and boil that down into a headline about a racist sandwich? The Education Action Group says it’s fair game, given the story and the fact that an educator singled out the sandwich in a lesson about cultural competency. But come on. Read the original story. Gutierrez is quoted as suggesting to staff: "Americans eat peanut butter and jelly, do you have anything like that?" That’s not an indictment of the sandwich. Portland Public Schools did not spend half a million dollars to label the sandwich "racist." The principal never called the sandwich racist. The Portland Tribune never said the principal called the sandwich racist. And yes, we don’t usually weigh in on lunch, but who could resist? The statement is inaccurate and silly. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.	None	Education Action Group	None	None	None	2012-09-18T17:43:26	2012-09-16	['None']
pomt-09399	"There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/23/bart-stupak/stupak-says-there-no-federal-funding-abortion-sena/	With the health care bill teetering in the balance, antiabortion Democrat Rep. Bart Stupak's announcement hours before the final vote that an agreement had been reached on the abortion issue marked a momentous shift. For weeks, Stupak insisted he and a group of other abortion foes in the House could not support the Senate bill because it would result in federal funding of abortions, contrary to longstanding federal policy. But on the afternoon of March 21, 2010, Stupak said in a news conference that the promise of an executive order on abortion from President Barack Obama convinced him "there will be no public funding of abortion in this legislation." Stupak's comments several hours later on the House floor provided some of the most emotionally charged moments of the late-night health care debate. "It is the Democrats who, through the president's executive order, ensure that the sanctity of life is protected," Stupak said. His comments were interrupted by catcalls from the bill's Republican opponents, one of whom was heard to yell "baby killer!" Texas Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer later said he was the one who shouted. But he said he yelled "It's a baby killer," referring not to Stupak (to whom he apologized), but to the agreement Stupak helped forge with the president. The abortion issue in the health care reform debate has been thorny from the start. From early on, legislators on both sides of the abortion issue professed a desire to maintain the status quo on abortion in the health care bill. But that quickly proved difficult, if not impossible. Here's why: Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. But the health care reform bill proposes a health care exchange in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question then: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do)? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? In the House, Stupak helped add an amendment that bars anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from buying a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. The amendment does let them choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without using federal subsidies. And those who accept subsidies can still buy an abortion "rider" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money. The Senate took a different tack. The Senate language on abortion, written by an abortion opponent, Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., would allow companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson inserted measures to ensure abortion services would be paid through patient premiums, not federal subsidies. In order to accomplish that, the Senate bill requires that anyone who selects a plan that covers abortion must pay $1 a month toward a segregated fund that would pay for abortion services. One plan in every state exchange must offer coverage that does not include abortions, so there would be an option for those who morally object to $1 of their premiums going toward abortion services. Legislators supporting the bill -- along with President Obama -- insist that segregation of funds stays true to the Hyde Amendment restriction on federal funds for abortions. The Senate bill's proposal on abortion is opposed by activists on both sides of the abortion issue. Abortion rights groups like NARAL Pro Choice America, the National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood all put out statements denouncing the requirement that policy owners or their employers write separate checks -- one for abortion services and one for everything else. NARAL called the provision "unacceptable bureaucratic stigmatization (that) could cause insurance carriers to drop abortion coverage, even though more than 85 percent of private plans currently cover this care for women." Abortion foes like the National Right to Life Committee and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops also vehemently opposed the Senate bill's abortion language, arguing that if you send federal subsidies to a person who then chooses a plan that cover abortions, that's federal funding of abortion. They called the plan to segregate money so that abortions are paid only through premiums -- not government subsidies -- nothing more than a bookkeeping scheme. Until March 21, 2010, that was Stupak's consistent position. In a Fox News interview on March 17, 2010, Stupak said of the Senate bill, "It is very clear that abortion is, for the first time ever, a funded benefit by the federal government." So, what changed on Sunday that prompted Stupak to say "there will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation"? In the hours leading up to the vote, he and several other antiabortion Democrats in the House agreed to back the health bill after Obama promised to sign an executive order reinforcing the commitment that no federal funds would be used for abortions. The Senate bill already spelled out strict payment and accounting requirements to accomplish that, but Obama's executive order went one step further, putting the president's weight behind specific measures to ensure that funds are properly segregated. By our reading, the order mostly restates and reinforces the intent of the Senate bill. But it doesn't fundamentally change the fact that people getting government subsidies for health care will be able to buy a policy on the exchange that covers abortions. That's why some abortion foes -- not all -- believe Stupak essentially traded his vote for a handful of beans. "It was issued for political effect," said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. "We don't see any value in the order." We don't think Rep. Stupak can credibly claim one day that the bill is federal funding of abortions, and then the next day, after getting the agreement on the executive order, that it does not. Stupak's issue all along was that if federal subsidies went to someone who could then choose a plan that covers abortions, that was federal funding for abortion. And that hasn't changed. The president's order spells out safeguards to ensure the funds are segregated. But if you thought that was a bookkeeping trick before, there's nothing in the executive order that would change your mind. At the climax of the health care debate from the floor, House Republican Leader John Boehner said that even with the executive order from the president, the Senate bill would provide "taxpayer funding of abortions for the first time in 30 years." We don't agree. It's understandable that abortion foes opposed a proposal that gives more people the opportunity to obtain insurance that cover abortions. But it's another thing to say those abortion services would be paid with federal dollars. The Senate bill states very clearly that public funding through tax credits and government subsidies for elective abortion services offered in the exchange is prohibited. But more than that, the bill sets up a mechanism to ensure that abortion services offered in the exchange are paid entirely from patient premiums, premiums paid by people who have chosen a private plan that covers abortion. The executive order puts the weight of the president's word behind providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled. We think that's enough to back up Stupak's claim, "There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation." But that's a conclusion we reached before the president promised an executive order, back when Stupak disagreed with us and insisted the bill would have had federal dollars subsidizing abortions. We don't understand how the executive order changes Stupak's logic on this issue, but no matter how he arrived as his conclusion, we think he's right now. And we rule his claim True.

pomt-02977	"Mark Herring voted to allow sex offenders, including rapists, to serve shorter sentences."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/21/mark-obenshain/obenshain-says-herring-voted-shorten-prison-senten/	The front of the campaign brochure has a mug shot of a grimacing, heavyset man in a undershirt. He’s holding a prisoner identification tag that says, "There are 1,268 convicted sex offenders in the Richmond area." Under the photo, Mark Obenshain, the Republican nominee for attorney general, asks, "Which candidate for attorney general will protect your family?" Open the glossy brochure and you get this answer: "Mark Herring voted to allow sex offenders, including rapists, to serve shorter sentences." Obenshain made the same charge against Herring, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, in a TV ad that began airing Oct. 7. So we checked whether Herring really did vote to ease prison sentences for sex offenders. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Obenshain’s campaign, said the claim centers on a bill that came up in the General Assembly earlier this year. Both Obenshain and Herring are state senators. The bill concerned about 155 crimes that, under Virginia law, must be punished with mandatory minimum sentences in prison. As introduced by Del. Robert Bell, R-Albemarle, the measure would have required that each count of a mandatory-sentence conviction be fully served in prison -- as opposed to allowing an inmate to serve several terms concurrently. Lets say, for example, a person is convicted on three counts that each carry a mandatory-minimum sentence of 10 years. Bell’s legislation would have required the criminal to serve at least 30 years. The bill grew out of a criminal case concerning Charles Lordell Jefferson Jr., who in 2011 was convicted in Fauquier County on six counts of production of child pornography, each carrying a mandatory minimum of of five years. Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey W. Parker imposed a six-year sentence for each count, but allowed allowed the prison terms to be served concurrently. So Jefferson faced only six years behind bars for child pornography crimes. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli contested the result, arguing it was the legislature’s intent in passing mandatory minimum sentence laws that prison time would be tacked on for each count. The Court of Appeals of Virginia rejected Cuccinelli’s argument. A three-judge panel noted that state laws specified consecutive prison terms for some mandatory-minimum crimes but not for others, including production of child pornography. The panel said that it must assume the General Assembly had a reason for setting the condition for some mandatory-minimum offenses and not for others. Bell introduced his bill to end the controversy, but the Senate stripped out the blanket provision that sentences for all mandatory-minimum counts be served sequentially. Instead, the Senate simply added a specification to child pornography laws that perpetrators would serve consecutive sentences for each violation. The House agreed to the change. But Gov. Bob McDonnell was unhappy with the amended bill. He sent it back to the General Assembly with a recommendation that consecutive-sentencing stipulations be added to laws of the nine mandatory-minimum crimes that were not covered, including rape and production of child pornography. Also on that list were various offenses involving gang activity, violating protective orders, shooting or throwing missiles at vehicles, transferring firearms, forcible sodomy and object penetration. McDonnell’s version of the bill flew through the House on a 95-3 vote, but narrowly passed the Senate on a 23-17 vote. Obenshain voted for the bill and Herring voted against it. "Sen. Herring did not support the Governor's recommendation because it deprived judges of too much of their existing discretion and made the justice system less flexible," Kevin O’Holleran, a Herring spokesman, said in an email. "Sen. Herring has supported mandatory minimums and strong penalties for crimes against children in the past (including life sentences) and this bill did not affect the length of any sentence for any crime." A study by the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission suggests the new law will cause little change in the actual time offenders spend in prison. The research examined 130,531 criminal sentences imposed in the state between mid 2005 and mid 2010. Of those crimes, only 18,659, or 14.3 percent, involved mandatory-minimum offenses. Only 3,225, or 2.5 percent, involved convictions on multiple counts of mandatory-minimum offenses. And of those 3,225 cases, the report says judges imposed sentences below consecutive-term standards only 3.1 percent of the time. That breaks down to about 100 cases over five years, or 20 cases annually. Now, keep in mind that those 20 annual cases in which judges used sentencing discretion could have involved nine different offenses -- not all of them sex crimes. Meredith Farrar-Owens, director of the sentencing commission, said her agency lacks data to break down by each offense the instances when judges used discretion in passing out sentences on multiple count, mandatory-minimum convictions. "It’s a small percentage of a small percentage of cases where judges elected not to give consecutive sentences," she said. Our ruling Obenshain said Herring voted to allow sex offenders to "serve shorter sentences." Herring voted against a bill that ended the sentencing discretion judges had in rare cases when some sex offenders and a few other types of criminals were convicted on multiple counts. Because judges occasionally invoked their option to allow inmates to serve multiple prison terms concurrently, there’s a slight basis for the claim that Herring’s vote would allow some offenders to serve shorter terms than they would have if the judges had no choice. But for the most part, Obenshain’s claim is misleading. Herring’s vote would not have shortened the prison time faced by sex offenders, it merely would have continued the the sentencing procedures in place. And Obenshain, in his broad reference to sex offenders, omits the fact that only a tiny percentage of them had circumstances in their cases that allowed for discretion in sentencing. We rate Obenshain’s claim Mostly False.	None	Mark Obenshain	None	None	None	2013-10-21T10:31:08	2013-10-04	['None']
pomt-03853	"The majority of my contributions have been from private individuals" giving $125 on average, "not from PACs, not from groups."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/13/ed-fallone/ed-fallone-says-majority-his-contributions-supreme/	In his bid to unseat Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Pat Roggensack, challenger Ed Fallone is embracing the underdog role. That, he said, shows up in his campaign contributions. "We don’t have deep pockets," Fallone told Journal Sentinel reporters and editors March 6, 2013. "I am very proud of the fact that, through my first campaign finance report, the majority of my contributions have been from private individuals, not from PACs, not from groups." Fallone, a Marquette University law professor making his first bid for office, said "the average size of my contributions to date has been $125." Roggensack, considered part of the court’s conservative wing, did dominate the fundraising game before the Feb. 19, 2013, primary. She raised nearly three times Fallone’s total from Jan. 1 to Feb. 4 of 2013, though the amounts were modest for a statewide race, the Journal Sentinel reported. The two face off in the April 2, 2013, election. Let’s examine Fallone’s assertion that "the majority of my contributions have been from private individuals" giving $125 on average, "not from PACs, not from groups." The money trail Fallone reported raising about $75,000 for the period. His two largest campaign gifts came from political action committees (PACs) organized by unions representing Madison teachers (the maximum $8,625 donation) and other public employees ($8,500). The third biggest, an individual donation from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, was $5,000. In all, Fallone’s four PAC contributions made up about 24 percent of his receipts, roughly $18,000. Donors who gave as individuals made up more than three-fourths of his cash gifts. Looked at another way, by the number of donors, all but a handful of his 500 givers were individuals, not PACs. So the guts of Fallone’s claim is on target. To be sure, Roggensack can make the same claim; less than 5 percent of her pre-primary donations came from PACs that included two county-level Republican Party units, the Milwaukee Police union, bankers, builders and utilities. She raised about $202,000 in 2013 before the primary. Case closed? Not entirely. In his claim, Fallone said "PACs" and "groups." And there is a nuance here that alters the picture a bit. About one-sixth of Fallone’s money was given by individuals, but bundled up by special-interest groups and sent to the candidate in one check from the group. These are known as "conduit" donations. The approach allows corporations, unions and other groups to present larger checks to candidates than they could under the rules for PACs. By state law, the donors are publicly disclosed and listed as individual donors on campaign finance reports. And in media accounts they are typically counted as individual donors. So Fallone has cause to count them that way. But they are not just individual donors. In Fallone’s case, Wisconsin trial lawyers banded together as the "Justice Fund" conduit, and education union employees in the United Staff Union, combined to make up 71 of his slightly more than 500 donors. When those are combined with PAC contributions, they represent 41 percent of his total contributions. That’s a far bigger amount than PACs alone. However, even if you count the conduit bucks as group gifts, individuals still make up almost 60 percent of Fallone’s donations. And his claim was simply they made up a majority. For her part, Roggensack received a small number of conduit donations, most notably from the Fund for Parent Choice, whose backers support the school voucher program. As for the average size of the donations from individuals, Fallone said it was $125. Our calculation came up with $114. So he’s a bit high, but on the right side considering his point is the modest amounts of his typical gifts. Of course, third-party interest groups are allowed to spend independently on behalf of the Supreme Court candidates. Those amounts are reported separately from the candidate’s campaign funds and they are not supposed to coordinate their campaign efforts with the candidates. Before the primary, two union-funded groups spent modestly on campaign literature in support of Fallone. The Wisconsin Club for Growth spent on behalf of Roggensack’s campaign. Our rating Fallone said "the majority of my contributions have been from private individuals" giving $125 on average, "not from PACs, not from groups." Not all private individuals are created equal, we found, but Fallone’s analysis is reasonable, his numbers are on target and his claim about average gift size is slightly off but in his favor. His statement is accurate with those clarifications. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Ed Fallone	None	None	None	2013-03-13T09:00:00	2013-03-06	['None']
pomt-15263	Russia and China "absolutely said pretty clearly" they would not keep economic sanctions on Iran if the United States "walked away from the deal."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/30/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-tells-huckabee-russia-china-said-clea/	The Obama administration says the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran is a significant improvement over the status quo. Critics say the opposite — that no deal would be better. A recent exchange between Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly and Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee pivots around this point. O’Reilly argued that the alternative to an agreement was war, which Huckabee dismissed as an Obama talking point. To Huckabee, the better play was to continue and strengthen economic sanctions on Iran, forcing them into a position of weakness. O’Reilly equally dismissed that idea. "Russia and China told us if we had walked away from this deal that they were not going to obey the sanctions any longer," O’Reilly said. Huckabee said that wasn’t "for sure." But O’Reilly doubled down. "They absolutely said pretty clearly," O’Reilly replied. Russia and China certainly could knock the teeth out of any economic sanctions if they pulled out. Did they signal those intentions to the United States? Conventional wisdom As part of the nuclear agreement, the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany agreed to phase out various economic sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy in exchange for concessions in Iran’s nuclear program. Lifting sanctions against Iran was a top concern for Russia, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in April. "In general, we are principled opponents of the use of methods of pressure in international relations, of restricting lawful rights of states in selfish, lucrative interests," Lavrov said. "It is a short-sighted policy, which, as a rule, has a boomerang effect on its authors." News articles cited by O'Reilly's staff highlight U.S. concern that if a deal was not reached, then some countries, including Russia, China and India, would no longer observe sanctions because they were not seen as a permanent solution. Experts share that view. "It was unlikely the coalition supporting sanctions could have been kept together indefinitely to maintain pressure on Iran, and there was little appetite either domestically or internationally to use force to disable Iran’s nuclear program," said Francis Gavin, the Frank Stanton Professor in Nuclear Security Policy Studies in MIT’s Department of Political Science. Vipin Narang, an MIT associate professor of political science and author of Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era, said, "A more stringent sanctions regime would have been virtually impossible to construct and sustain." Obama repeated these concerns in April. "If it is perceived that we walked away from a fair deal that gives us assurances Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon, then those international sanctions will fray," he said. "And it won’t just be Russia or China. It will be some of our close allies." In fact, Russia and China were barely acknowledging sanctions as they were. The United States’ sanctions on Iran can be traced back to the 1979 hostage crisis, while sanctions by the United Nations go back to 2006. Additional sanctions have been placed on Iran since then by the United States, European Union and United Nations. Together, these sanctions affected Iran’s nuclear, missile, energy, shipping, transportation, and financial sectors, according to the Department of State website. The hope of these sanctions was to starve Iran of the resources it needed to proliferate its nuclear and missile programs, and encourage Iran to sit down for talks. Before the Iran deal was even struck, both Russia and China had already ignored some of the U.S. and E.U. sanctions. Based on their past actions, it is unlikely that either country would have had a sudden change of heart and supported continued sanctions against Iran if the deal had fallen through. Russian leaders have said they only recognize the U.N. Security Council sanctions. Richard Brennan, senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation, said even though he does not know of any explicit mention of Russia or China saying they would stop sanctions against Iran, O’Reilly’s "meaning is accurate." Records of sanctions against Iran compiled by the Jewish Virtual Library show that in spite of the sanctions, both Russia and China have profited from Iranian oil, and Russia has continued to sell weapons to Iran. Our ruling O’Reilly said that Russia and China "absolutely said pretty clearly" they would not keep economic sanctions on Iran if the United States "walked away from the deal." Russia and China certainly have given signals that they both wanted sanctions against Iran removed. Both Russia and China have a history of ignoring sanctions that have been placed on Iran. Experts say that if the United States, one of the strongest supporters of these sanctions, had abandoned the deal, then it is likely that China, Russia and possibly other countries would have disregarded these sanctions. O'Reilly is pushing the envelope when he said "absolutely" clear, as they haven't issued formal statements. But all of their actions indicate that what O'Reilly said is substantially accurate. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Bill O'Reilly	None	None	None	2015-07-30T18:00:25	2015-07-27	['Russia', 'United_States', 'Iran', 'China']
pomt-05612	"Up to 80 percent of small businesses will be forced to give up their current plans due to new Obamacare regulations."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/27/senate-republican-conference/senate-republican-web-video-says-obamas-health-car/	Senate Republicans focused on what they called the president’s "broken promises" near the two-year anniversary of the health care law. A Web video posted March 22, 2012, by the Senate Republican Conference details eight promises it says President Barack Obama has broken, countering with claims of its own. We’re checking a few of them -- for example, the claim that Obama didn't keep his promise about reducing health care premiums. (We found Republicans’ response Mostly False.) In this check, we’re focusing the Republicans' response to Obama's statement on Aug. 15, 2009: "No matter what you've heard, if you like your doctor or health care plan, you can keep it." Back then, we found a similar claim by the president just Half True. In this case, we’re fact-checking the response, offered by the Senate Republican Conference video in text on the screen: "Reality: Up to 80% of small businesses will be forced to give up their current plans due to new Obamacare regulations." We wondered, is that the case? ‘Relinquishing their grandfathered status’ We talked with Kyle Downey, communications director for the Senate Republican Conference. He pointed us to a table that includes an 80 percent figure. The table was published as part of the government’s interim final rules on "grandfathered status" for group health plans and health insurance coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It matches a table published by Health and Human Services, also in June 2010. Grandfathered status means that employer plans are allowed to remain largely as they were before the law was enacted. As long as a health care plan doesn’t substantially change, it won’t have to comply with all parts of the new health care law, for example, the requirement that preventive health services be covered without any cost sharing. That provision was the subject of the recent contraceptives debate. (All plans will have to meet some of the law’s requirements, such as no coverage exclusions for children with pre-existing conditions, no lifetime limits on coverage and extending parents’ coverage to young adults under 26.) An employer may even switch to a similar plan with a different insurer, as long as it doesn’t make changes such as cutting benefits or increasing out-of-pocket spending. If employers made such changes, say, by raising co-pays by more than $5, it would have to comply with the rest of the law, triggering requirements for a wider range of benefits that could cost more. The 80 percent reflected the high-end estimate of the number of small employer plans that may "relinquish" grandfathered status by 2013. By comparison, the mid range estimate was 66 percent. The low-end estimate was 49 percent. 'Forced' Is giving up grandfathered status the same thing as small businesses being "forced to give up their current plans"? Not necessarily, said experts we spoke with on both sides of the health care debate. Timothy Jost, a health care law expert at Washington and Lee University School of Law, argues that small employers won’t be "forced" to give up their plans under the new law. They would have to change their plans themselves to lose their grandfathered status. "If a small business (or individual, or large business) keeps its current plan, it is grandfathered, period," he said. Eighty percent of small businesses may lose grandfathered status "simply because they change their plans so much that they are no longer the same plan," he said. Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a consultant to both the Gov. Mitt Romney and Obama administrations in designing their health care plans, also takes issue with the word "forced." "A key thing to watch out for in this debate is mixing up voluntary actions with ‘forced’ actions," he said. "What the (Health and Human Services) memo says is that almost 80 percent of small firms will move out of grandfathered plans. It doesn’t say that they will be forced out — most of the moves will be voluntary as firms move to plans that they prefer. We don't know what the split is between voluntary and involuntary moves. Even before Obamacare, most small firms change plans over time." Downey, the Senate Republican Conference spokesman, and health care expert Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute, argued the law will force employers to change plans. Downey disagrees with Jost’s assessment that a plan change by an employer that would trigger loss of grandfathered status makes it a different plan. "The idea that losing grandfathered status means the plan has changed is a bit silly — a $5 co-pay increase is enough to trigger loss of grandfathering," Downey said. "The idea that such a small co-pay is tantamount to changing one's plan is frankly absurd." In other words, he argues that since a small change can trigger the requirement to comply with the health care law, it’s essentially forcing employers to comply. Tanner, the author of the report "Bad Medicine: A guide to the real costs and consequences of the new health care law," argues that changes would be forced because "if you lose grandfathered status, when you renew, you have to come into compliance." And the law will make it harder for employers to maintain their current plans, his report says. Insurers won’t be able to enroll new business customers in plans that don’t comply with the law, meaning they may stop offering them. That would "force" companies to lose their grandfathered status, he argued. "There's no doubt that a significant number of them will have to because of the new law," he said. "... I think 80 percent is the high end of the range, but there's no doubt that a lot of people will be impacted in that way." How many businesses might change because they have no choice compared with those that shift voluntarily to pursue cheaper, better coverage? "It's really hard to tell," he said. Health and Human Services argues the switches will be primarily voluntary. "The new health care law creates an online marketplace where small business owners can easily compare plan benefits and costs and determine if they qualify for a new tax credit for health insurance, which brings greater transparency and competition and affordability to the market," said Erin Shields, communications director for health care for HHS. "When this new marketplace is online, it will be easier for small businesses to compare their options and choose the best private insurance plan for themselves and their employees. "Of course small business owners also have the option to keep the plan they had before the law was passed as well." Our ruling A Senate Republican Conference video argues that "up to 80 percent of small businesses will be forced to give up their current plans due to new Obamacare regulations." In doing so, it is choosing an estimate that is at the high end of a range that also includes estimates of 66 and 49 percent, but the video does say "up to." Businesses give up that status by changing their plans, whether by choice or because of the exigencies of the market. The health care law doesn’t directly force businesses to give up their plans, which makes the statement only partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-03228	Under Obamacare, "The IRS will have access to the American people’s protected health care information."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2013/aug/19/eric-cantor/cantor-says-obamacare-gives-irs-access-personal-he/	During a recent floor debate, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor warned of dire consequences from the IRS implementing portions of Obamacare and collecting taxes to help pay for the health care reforms. "The IRS will have access to the American people’s protected health care information," Cantor, R-7th, said Aug. 2. He expressed distrust of the IRS, referring to disclosures earlier this year that the agency gave special scrutiny to the Tea Party and other conservative groups seeking tax exemptions. Giving the IRS access to personal medical records "is nothing short of an unwelcome big government overreach into the most personal aspect of our lives," Cantor said. Shortly after his comments, the House, in a party-line vote, approved the "Keep the IRS off your Health Care Act" that would bar the IRS from any involvement in Obamacare. The measure, like 39 other House-approved bills that would end or dismantle the health care act, is expected to die in the Senate. Cantor made a similar statement during a July 27 broadcast, saying, "The doctor’s office is the last place anyone would want to find the IRS. Your health care information is private and should remain so." We wondered whether Obamacare really would give the IRS access to records of our illnesses, surgeries and prescriptions. We asked Cantor’s office for proof. His spokesman, Rory Cooper, cited a June 18 article in the conservative Breitbart.com about a rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Starting in January, Obamacare will require people who can afford health insurance to buy coverage or pay a tax penalty. Many who are now uninsured are expected to buy policies through insurance exchanges that are being set up. The rule requires private companies participating in the exchanges to submit information about new customers to HHS so the agency can assure that these people have bought at least the minimum levels of coverage required by Obamacare and verify those receiving federal assistance buying their policies fall into qualifying income categories. The Breitbart article discusses concerns by some conservative organizations and publications that HHS might share that information with the IRS. But the story stops short of Cantor’s claim that the IRS will have access to the data. HHS officials repeatedly have said they will not be seeking intimate details from medical histories and guaranteed the department will not share the information with the IRS, as reported by this spring by our colleagues at PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org. Again, it should be noted that the data will not be collected on everyone, just those who buy coverage through exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 26 million people living in the U.S. in 2020 -- less than 8 percent of population -- will be insured by the exchanges. Twice since May, IRS officials have testified at House hearings that they will not have access to private medical records. The agency’s website states, "Nothing in (Obamacare) allows the IRS to access individual’s health information, including information about individuals’ health status and any health care services received." The IRS will share tax information to help HHS determine whether low-income families and individuals qualify for assistance in purchasing insurance. A computer system is being developed that will give HHS instant access to that information. But it will be a one-way system, and the IRS will not be able to view HHS records. So how will the IRS identify uninsured Americans who must pay Obamacare’s penalty tax? "Taxpayers will get a form at the end of every year from their insurer to use when they prepare their tax returns," then-IRS Deputy Commissioner Steven Miller told a House subcommittee in September 2012. "It is important to note that the information that insurers provide to the IRS will show the fact of insurance coverage, and will not include any personal health information. In most cases, taxpayers will file their tax returns reporting their health insurance coverage, and/or making a payment, and there will be no need for further interactions with the IRS." Our ruling Cantor said that under Obamacare, "the IRS will have access to the American people’s protected health care information." But he offers no hard proof, just speculation on a blog. The IRS will play a major role in Obamacare by collecting a variety of taxes that will help support the program. But contrary to Cantor’s claim, IRS officials have repeatedly testified before Congress that they will not have access to the intimate details of anyone’s health records. Cantor’s unfounded statement does nothing more than amp up public fear for his ongoing fight to repeal Obamacare. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-09181	The American Power Act "would cut our dependence on oil in half."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/03/votevetsorg/votevetsorg-claims-cap-and-trade-bill-would-halve-/	A recent TV ad from the left-leaning VoteVets.org, which represents American veterans, takes a circuitous route to its real agenda: a plug for the American Power Act, the latest version of the cap-and-trade bill introduced on May 12, 2010, by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn. The ad begins with nasty images from the oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico. Then we are introduced to Evan Wolf, a Louisiana National Guardsman who was assigned to Gulf Coast clean up. "When I signed on to the National Guard, I did it to help protect Americans from our enemies, like in the Persian Gulf, not to clean up an oil company's mess here in the Gulf of Mexico," Wolf says. He holds up a freezer bag filled with a murky goop. "We'll do whatever mission we're given and do it well," Wolf says. "But America needs a new mission. Because whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas, our dependence on oil is threatening our national security. "Thing is, a clean American energy plan would cut our dependence on oil in half. It's more power for America, made here in America. Putting our people to work using all the resources we have." We then get images of solar and wind farms. "Some folks in Washington say now is not the time to clean American power," Wolf says, and then dabs at oil staining a Louisiana beach. "I've gotta ask -- if not now … when?" By way of background, Wolf was a Democratic candidate for the Louisiana House in 2007. He lost, but a Democratic National Committee web page suggests he's at least mulling another run. VoteVets explained that the ad is advocating for the American Power Act, and that it is that bill that "would cut our dependence on oil in half." That's the claim we are checking here. The American Power Act is the latest version of the cap and trade bill that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Obama put in a plug for the bill in a speech on June 2, 2010, in Pittsburgh. "The time has come, once and for all, for this nation to fully embrace a clean energy future," Obama said, and vowed it would become an administration priority. "The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months," Obama said. VoteVets backs up the ad's claim that the American Power Act would "cut our dependence on oil in half" by citing a 2009 analysis from the National Resources Defense Council of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which was passed by the House on June 26, 2009. The bill sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a variety of market-based (cap-and-trade) mechanisms, incentives for energy efficiency and the development of clean energy. The Council's report on the House bill last year concluded that if the bill passed, America's dependence on foreign oil would be cut in half by 2050. But the same report projected that while oil imports would be halved, overall oil consumption would drop by about 12 percent between 2010 and 2050 (from 17.1 million barrels per day to 15 million barrels per day in 2050). We note that in the ad, Wolf doesn't say the bill would cut consumption of foreign oil in half, it says the bill would "cut our dependence on oil in half." There's a difference. VoteVets, which is backing the video with a $1.5 million ad buy, contends the context of the ad makes clear that they are talking about oil imports, but we don't agree. The ad is set against the backdrop of an oil drilling catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. In his setup, Wolf frames the discussion as "whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas." That seems to us like he's talking about oil consumption in general and the need for the United States to ween off it. Reducing dependence on foreign oil would not reduce drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. It's also worth noting that the government did an analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill and didn't paint quite as rosy a picture as the Council. The U.S. Energy Information Administration would only project to 2030 (not 2050). But the EIA's report projected relatively little change in overall liquid fuel consumption. The report did forecast that U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports would decline, from 8.26 million barrels per day in 2010 to 6.3 million barrels per day in 2030. That's a roughly 24 percent decrease. But the report also projected a decline in foreign oil imports even without the bill. There are a numbers of reasons for that, said Jonathan Cogan, spokesman for U.S. Energy Information Administration: a slight increase in domestic oil production; increased use of bio-fuels; tighter fuel efficiency standards; and an expected rise in oil prices. The EIA has not yet finished its analysis of the American Power Act, Cogan noted, though it should be completed in mid to late June. The goals of the Senate bill and last year's House bill may be the same, but the mechanisms are a little different, so using the EIA report on the 2009 House bill to judge the 2010 Senate bill is an "imperfect comparison," Cogan said. However, Daniel Lashof, director of the Council's Climate Center, said the basic provisions are similar enough that the 2009 analyses are legitimate. Therefore, he said, the Council is comfortable with the projection that the American Power Act has the potential to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil by 50 percent by 2050. Lashof said part of the reason the Council's projections differed from the EIA's is that EIA did not account for the potential boost to domestic oil production by capturing carbon dioxide from power plants. Recovered carbon dioxide -- encouraged by the bill -- can be injected into depleted oil fields to enhance oil production, Lashof said. As a result, he said, the NRDC projects a slight increase in domestic oil production between now and 2050 under the bill, but in a safer way "not subject to the kinds of risks of going into deeper and deeper water offshore." In summary, the ad claims that if the American Power Act is passed, it would "cut our dependence on oil in half." VoteVets says they were talking about cutting dependence on foreign oil in half. And they point to a credible report from the Council that projects a similar bill would cut foreign oil imports in half by 2050. A spokesman for the EIA says basing a projection of the effect of the 2010 Senate bill on an analysis of a similar, but different, 2010 Senate bill is an "imperfect comparison." We also note that the EIA's analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill is less optimistic than the NRDC. But most significantly, we think the context of the ad suggests Wolf is talking about cutting overall oil consumption -- not just foreign oil imports -- in half. If they were only talking about oil imports, why would Wolf be standing on an oil-stained beach in Louisiana? Perhaps newer reports will ultimately back up the VoteVets claim, but they based their claim on a 2009 report that actually projects a much smaller reduction in overall oil consumption. And so we rate the claim Half True.	None	VoteVets.org	None	None	None	2010-06-03T18:28:08	2010-05-26	['None']
pomt-14685	Says Chris Christie "instituted an Internet sales tax."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/conservative-solutions-pac/marco-rubio-superpac-says-chris-christie-imposed-i/	New Jersey's Republican governor and presidential candidate Chris Christie is under attack for his tax policies by the Conservative Solutions PAC, a political action committee that supports GOP Sen. Marco Rubio for the presidency. It is not directly tied to the Rubio campaign. In a 30-second TV commercial, the super PAC said that "Christie could well be (President) Obama's favorite Republican governor." One reason given by the narrator: "He instituted an Internet sales tax." The accompanying graphic, beneath a photograph of Christie with a smiling Obama, shows a Wall Street Journal headline from July 16, 2012, which says, "Christie Embraces Online Sales Tax." Republicans tend to be passionately opposed to new taxes so we wondered if that was the whole story. First, some background. Currently, under a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision, if a customer lives in a state with a sales tax, online companies only have to collect that tax if the company has a physical presence -- such as a warehouse -- in that state. Otherwise, it's up to the consumer to directly pay the tax to the state in the form of a "use" tax. The use tax, which nearly all consumers ignore, will become important later in this fact check. The absence of a sales tax on Internet purchases puts local brick-and-mortar businesses at a competitive disadvantage, which is one reason some states would like to tax Internet sales. Another reason, obviously, is that it brings in extra revenue. But critics point out that it can be a nightmare for companies that do business over the Internet to keep track of the widely-varying rules and rates in all the states, counties and municipalities that have a sales tax. So what's Christie's role in all of this? When we contacted the Tampa-based Conservative Solutions PAC, spokesman Jeff Sadosky sent us several links to articles showing that Christie supports an Internet sales tax, including federal legislation designed to standardize the collection system for all states. We also found the 2012 Wall Street Journal report, cited in the commercial, reporting that Christie was one of several Republican governors pushing for a tax on online purchases to help deal with their fiscal crises. But the super PAC didn't just say he supports the tax. It says he instituted it, and here it gets a bit more complicated. New Jersey started getting serious Internet money when Amazon, the online retail giant, decided to build two distribution centers in New Jersey as part of an effort to improve delivery. But Christie didn't have to do anything to get that revenue. (In fact, the state delayed Amazon's requirement to collect New Jersey sales taxes for two years.) "By building a warehouse, Amazon then has physical presence in the state and must automatically begin collecting sales tax on sales to residents in the state. This is automatic, unless a state passes legislation to exempt them (as one or two have, for a limited transition period of time)," said Joseph Henchman, vice president for state projects at The Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group that does state-by-state comparisons of tax issues. Amazon also negotiates deals with individual states. It currently pays sales taxes to 27 of the 44 states with such a tax. What Christie -- and the state legislature -- did was institute was a "click-through nexus" tax law, commonly called an Amazon tax. It makes Internet companies responsible for collecting the sales tax from New Jersey customers if they, in essence, have middlemen in the state. Said Henchman: "These are laws that expand the definition of physical presence to something beyond having employees and property in the state. For example, the New York law said that any non-present retailer, who has contracts with in-state people to refer potential customers for compensation, is physically present." Nineteen states now have such laws, he said. They're becoming popular after the New York Court of Appeals upheld that state's law and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. New Jersey's law was part of the 2015 budget signed by Christie. It applies to out-of-state online retailers who meet two basic criteria. First, their cumulative income from sales to New Jersey consumers must exceed $10,000 per year. Second, the retailer must have a referral program. That's where a person or business in New Jersey gets a cut of the profits when sending a consumer to the retailer's out-of-state website and the consumer makes a purchase. A true Internet sales tax, one unencumbered by all of these rules, would require federal legislation. But there's a final twist, as acting state treasurer Ford Scudder pointed out. None of this adds to the tax burden of New Jersey residents. Remember the "use tax" we mentioned earlier? Residents were already required to pay that sales tax directly to the state on all Internet purchases. "From our way of thinking, this is not a new tax," Scudder said. "All this is saying is, rather than putting the onus on individual (to pay the use tax), it's on the company" to pay the same amount as a sales tax. Henchman of the Tax Foundation agreed, "It's a different way of collecting an existing tax, albeit a tax that wasn't being paid." Our ruling Conservative Solutions' attack ad says Chris Christie "instituted an Internet sales tax." Internet businesses with a physical presence in the state were required to collect a New Jersey sales tax long before Christie took office. For businesses outside the state, Christie did expand the requirement that online businesses pay taxes when they have an agreement with an individual or a business in New Jersey to promote their products. The ad says "implemented," which implies that Christie imposed a new tax burden on residents. In fact, the money New Jersey is collecting through Internet sales is, by law, already owed to the state -- either through the sales tax collected by the business or the use tax that's supposed to be paid by consumers. Because the statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context, so we rate it Mostly False..	None	Conservative Solutions PAC	None	None	None	2016-01-14T17:00:00	2016-01-04	['None']
pomt-02145	"For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/05/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-40-times-more-kentuckians-have-gott/	Now that more than 8 million Americans have signed up for coverage under Obamacare, the White House has all but declared victory after the law’s initially troubled rollout. But many of the law’s critics continue to see the law as a disaster. A reader sent us a newsletter to constituents released by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a critic of the law and a potential presidential candidate in 2016. Here’s an excerpt from the newsletter, which was dated May 2, 2014: "Since the implementation of Obamacare, hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians have received cancellation notices from their current health care providers. For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage. Obamacare has been presented to the American people through twisted rhetoric, smoke and mirrors. Obamacare is not good for America and it certainly (is) not good for Kentucky. I would like (to) hear how Obamacare affected you, your family or your small business. Share your story by visiting my website." The claim that leapt out at us was, "For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage." Could that really be true? We took a look at the data. How many Kentuckians have received cancellation notices? Tracking cancellations isn’t so easy, because cancellations are issued by private health insurance companies, and regulations differ in each state. The Associated Press assembled a comprehensive, 50-state look at Obamacare-related cancellations and concluded that, in Kentucky, 130,000 people received cancellation notices. Meanwhile, the Kentucky Department of Insurance has put the number at 168,000. So a reasonable number for cancellations in Kentucky is probably between 130,000 and 168,000. How many Kentuckians have signed up for Obamacare? The answer depends on your definition of "Obamacare." The broader measure includes both signups for private insurance at the state-run Kynect insurance marketplace, as well as signups for Medicaid, the longstanding government-run health insurance program for the poor that Kentucky chose to expand under Obamacare. In late April 2014, the state announced that 82,795 Kentuckians had purchased private plans on Kynect and 330,615 others had qualified for Medicaid coverage, for a total of 413,410. Data from the federal Department of Health and Human Services that counts a few more weeks of signups had slightly higher numbers. Comparing the two numbers Using just these numbers, Paul is either wrong or very wrong. The smaller number -- private-insurance number of signups (82,795) -- is exceeded by the number of cancellations (up to 168,000), but at most, the discrepancy is only twice as big, not 40 times as big. But it’s not clear that this is the right number to use. Paul’s newsletter didn’t only refer to private plans, and the Medicaid expansion was just as much a part of Obamacare as the marketplaces for private health insurance plans. So if you include both types of signups (413,410), then the combined Medicaid and private-insurance signups in Kentucky actually exceeded the number of cancellations by more than double. So Paul’s claim is not just off-base, it’s actually going in the opposite direction. In fact, the 40-times-higher claim is ridiculously off-base. If you take the smallest possible number of signups (82,795, counting just the new private plans) and multiply it by 40, you’d need more than 3.3 million cancellations to make the math work. Yet as of 2011-12, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there were only about 2.2 million Kentuckians who had insurance that could even theoretically be canceled -- either insurance purchased individually or provided by employer. The remainder either had government-provided insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid or were uninsured. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that the number of employers who drop coverage in the future "could be a real issue," but for the 2014 statistics, she said, Paul’s calculation seemed "wildly off base." Our inquiries to Paul’s office were not returned. Our ruling Paul said that "for every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage." That’s not mathematically possible. If you take the narrowest definition of "sign-ups," there would have to be 3.3 million cancellations in the state for Paul’s statement to be accurate -- and there aren’t even that many Kentuckians with private insurance plans that could theoretically be canceled. In fact, it’s reasonable to argue that more people in Kentucky have coverage through Obamacare than have been canceled. Paul’s statement is so wildly off that we rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE, May 6, 2014: After we published this item, Paul’s office contacted us to explain how they calculated the 40-to-1 ratio of cancellations to signups. The office said that "the numbers he used were accurate as of November of last year" but that staffers failed "to update the numbers for the newsletter." Specifically, Paul’s office said that a Nov. 8, 2013, news release from the Kentucky governor’s office reported that 7,011 Kentuckians had enrolled in a private health plan through Nov. 8, compared to the 280,000 Kentuckians who the state believed at the time might be subject to cancellation notices. However, in the six months since, the number of private-plan signups has soared by a factor of 10, while the state released a smaller estimate of cancellation notices (168,000). Even in November, Paul’s estimate was cherry-picked; it excluded the 33,561 Kentuckians who enrolled in Medicaid, a program that saw its eligibility expanded under Obamacare. Even though the new numbers were available to Paul’s staff at the time the newsletter was put together, Paul’s office counted only the first two months of signups and ignored the final six months, a period when enrollment rose steadily. Our ruling stands: Pants on Fire.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2014-05-05T17:38:23	2014-05-02	['None']
pomt-08737	"Florida is 49th in per capita spending on mental health care."	true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/31/bud-chiles/chiles-says-florida-ranks-49th-capita-mental-healt/	Florida has long had a poor reputation for spending on social services. Bud Chiles, running as an independent for governor, criticizes the state's spending on mental health care. On his website Chiles said: "Nearly $3 billion dollars -- 10 percent of our state’s general fund -- is going to pay for Florida’s prisons. Meanwhile, Florida is 49th in per capita spending on mental health care, and 65 percent of inmates need substance abuse treatment and aren’t getting it. The only way to end this cycle is through community solutions. Let’s stop using a prison cell to solve problems when an ankle bracelet and drug counseling is proven to be more effective. Let’s get resources to communities so that they can provide services locally at less taxpayer expense, creating local jobs and real results." In this Truth-O-Meter item, we wanted to explore Chiles' claim that Florida is 49th in per capita spending on mental health. We spoke to Chiles on Aug. 31, 2010, who directed us to campaign spokeswoman Katie Ottenweller. She said the source of their information was a July 4, 2010, editorial in the Tallahassee Democrat by David L. Miller, a retired senior vice president of Florida Power Corp. who had been chair of the Florida Substance Abuse and Mental Health Corp. The editorial stated that during the 2010 session, Florida legislators cut the $190,000 needed to continue the corporation, which was an independent, nonprofit created by the Legislature. "The lack of services in Florida is shocking and embarrassing, as well as very costly," Miller wrote. "Our state ranks 49th in per capita spending for mental-health care, an abysmal ranking borne out by the thousands of people who cannot get treatment and end up in our jails, prisons and on the streets." Miller did not attribute the per capita spending comparison. PolitiFact Texas looked at a similar claim made by a candidate for lieutenant governor earlier this year. Marc Katz said that Texas ranked 50th -- last -- in per capita mental health spending. PolitiFact ranked that claim Mostly True because one state was lower than Texas: New Mexico. That item cited a report by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, Inc., posted on a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation website statehealthfacts.org that compares 50 states' and the District of Columbia per capita mental health spending. The chart ranked Florida 49th with $38.17 per capita followed by Texas at $34.57 and New Mexico in last place at $25.58. That report was based on fiscal year 2006 data, said Ted Lutterman, director of research analysis, in an interview. The 2007 report showed Florida 48th but Hawaii did not report and if it had, Florida would have been 49th, Lutterman said. The report based on 2008 data will be finished soon, said Lutterman, who said he is missing Alaska. But Alaska has always been ahead of Florida so he expects Florida to rank 49th again. "It's been consistent for several years," Lutterman said. We reached out to several other organizations in the mental health field to determine if they had any other information about Florida's mental health spending ranking. The National Alliance on Mental Illness gives states a grade, and in 2009 gave Florida a "D." The "Grading the States 2009" report evaluates measures such as the number of programs delivering evidence-based practices, emergency room wait-times, and the quantity of psychiatric beds by setting and whether Medicaid reimburses providers for all, or part of evidence-based practices; and more. In 2009, the organization gave six states an "F" and 21 states a "D." The report card is not based on per capita spending but gives us a general sense of how Florida compares -- somewhere in the bottom half of states. The nonprofit Mental Health America published a report in December 2007 called "Ranking America's Mental Health: An Analysis of Depression Across the States." Appendix B, which compares state mental health authority expenditures per capita for 50 states plus the District of Columbia, stated that Florida spent $35.96 while three states were lower: Arkansas $35.96, New Mexico $27.78 and Kansas $23.14. That report was based on 2004 data, said spokesman Steve Vetzner. A Sept. 10, 2009, letter to the editor in the Sun-Sentinel from Bob Sharpe, CEO and president of the Florida Council for Community Mental Health, states that Florida is 49th in per capita mental health spending but does not attribute the source of the ranking. We left a message for Sharpe but did not hear back. So how does Chiles' claim stack up? He said that Florida was 49th in per capita spending on mental health. The campaign cites an editorial that does not provide the source for the 49th figure. The Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, Inc., concluded in a 2006 report that Florida ranked 49th and that figure has been quoted several times by mental health experts such as Sharpe. Mental Health America wrote in a 2007 report that Florida was 48th -- but it was based on earlier 2004 data. Based on the information we could find, we rate this claim True.

pomt-03284	"They’ve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after this law (Romneycare) was implemented."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/aug/04/elizabeth-roberts/theyve-seen-employer-supported-coverage-increase-m/	One of the defining public policy debates of our time has been about Obamacare, formally the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010. So PolitiFact Rhode Island was listening closely to the July 28, 2013 broadcast of Channel 12 "Newsmakers," on which Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H. Roberts appeared. She is a leading figure in the debate, as chairwoman of the state Healthcare Reform Commission, which is charged with implementing Obamacare in Rhode Island. Providence Journal reporter Felice Freyer, one of the panelists, asked Roberts a hot-button question about Obamacare, which calls for the creation of state health insurance exchanges where individuals who don’t have health insurance or are seeking an alternative to plans provided by their employers may buy their own coverage. Since World War II, employer-paid coverage has been a cornerstone of health care insurance in the United States. Any possibility that the cornerstone will crumble has been a major topic in the debate. The Obamacare exchange is scheduled to open for enrollees in Rhode Island Oct. 1. After that happens, Freyer wanted to know, might employers just cancel their own insurance -- in order to save money and trouble -- and fob off their employees on the exchange. In reply, Roberts pointed to "Romneycare." That is the seven-year-old health care insurance program in Massachusetts nicknamed for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and often cited as the model for Obamacare. "They’ve seen employer-supported coverage increase in Massachusetts after [Romneycare] was implemented," Roberts declared. "I think lots of people were worried [that employers might drop coverage] but it hasn’t been what has happened." Are more Massachusetts employers providing coverage now than before "Romneycare?" First, a little background. Obamacare requires businesses with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. In Massachusetts, a penalty that applied to businesses with 11 or more employees was in force until July 1, when it was abolished in anticipation of the implementation of the Obamacare penalty. But then implementation of the federal employer mandate and accompanying penalty unexpectedly were delayed until 2015. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has warned employers in his state not to take advantage of the hiatus by dropping their insurance. A trip to the website of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector Authority, the agency that oversees Romneycare, showed that Roberts had her facts right. In 2001, well before Romneycare took effect, 69 percent of Massachusetts employers offered insurance, according to the Connector. As of 2010, four years after Romneycare was enacted, 77 percent offered insurance, the Connector says. Fresher data from another government body, the Center for Health Information and Analysis of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services, confirmed the trend. From 2005, the year before Romneycare was signed into law, through 2011, the percentage of employers offering insurance increased from 70 percent to 76 percent, according to a survey of employers. And a study by the independent Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, "Massachusetts Health Care Reform: Six Years Later," found that employer coverage had not decreased. When we checked with Roberts’ office about the basis of her statement, her spokeswoman, Maria Tocco, referred us to the Health and Human Services survey, albeit from a companion report. Nationally, according to Massachusetts authorities, only 60 percent of employers offer health insurance. Asked why more Massachusetts employers offered insurance even though an alternative had been created, Jason Lefferts, the Connector director of communications, said the business community responded to a call to duty from government when health care reform was enacted. "We saw great buy-in from the business community" and an acceptance that health care is a shared responsibility of the individual, business and government, Lefferts said. "There was a message that everyone was in this together." The Massachusetts authorities went even further on the Connector website, to predict that as employment rebounds in their state, "reliance on public sector insurance will decrease." Lefferts said the business community’s track record makes that a safe prediction. Our ruling Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Elizabeth H.

pomt-02950	Wisconsin sold fresh water to California, helping that state's dairy industry, and "lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/28/amardeep-kaleka/wisconsin-sold-fresh-water-california-potential-de/	After their father and five other worshippers were shot to death on Aug. 5, 2012 at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis., brothers Amar and Pardeep Kaleka became active with Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Pardeep said in a video for the national group, of which the Oak Creek and Milwaukee mayors are members, that 34 Americans are murdered with guns every day. We rated his statement Mostly True. Ten months later, Amar (also known as Amardeep) stepped into an even more public role, announcing plans to run in 2014 against eight-term U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate. Kaleka, a 35-year-old Democrat and documentary filmmaker, was interviewed about his planned candidacy on the Oct. 20, 2013 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a public affairs program on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee. When Gousha asked Kaleka what he would say to people who might view him as a one-dimensional candidate focused on guns, Kaleka turned the conversation to the economy. "I mean, gun legislation is just one of the many things that are holding us down economically. A number of other things, immigration reform, the economic disparity that we’re experiencing, has to do with our thoughts and models that we’ve had in place for now, well over two decades," he said. "I mean, the Midwest is a great example of how we’re losing so many factories and manufacturing jobs and agricultural jobs. For example, we used to be called America's Dairyland. Now, California is called America's Dairyland. We sent them fresh water, and we sold it to them. Ultimately, we didn't get anything in exchange. We lost a bunch of jobs, a bunch of farmland." It’s been two decades since California eclipsed Wisconsin in milk production, although Wisconsin still calls itself America’s Dairyland. But we’ve never heard that Wisconsin had sold fresh water to California to boost their dairy industry -- and lost jobs and farmland in the process. Wouldn’t there have been a titanic hue and cry if that had ever happened? Big ideas To be sure, there have been some grandiose proposals to sell Great Lakes water to faraway places. In 1998, a Canadian company actually obtained a permit from Ontario to ship fresh water by tankers from Lake Superior to Asia. But after a backlash in Canada and the United States, the permit was canceled two weeks later. In 2007, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Richardson raised the possibility of exporting Great Lakes water to the Southwest, calling for a national water policy and saying "states like Wisconsin are awash in water." But less than two weeks after Richardson’s comments rattled Midwest politicians, his campaign issued a statement saying Richardson "in no way proposes federal transfers of water from one region of the nation to the other." The following year, the eight Great Lakes states reached agreement on the Great Lakes Compact, which bans Great Lakes water from being "diverted," or piped out of the basin, with a few exceptions, such as the possible sale of Lake Michigan water from Oak Creek to another Milwaukee suburb, Waukesha, which is under consideration. Even then, Waukesha would have to return 100 percent of the water by volume to the lake by discharging treated wastewater to the Root River in Franklin. Even with the compact, officials remain wary of outsiders coveting Great Lakes water, said Tim Eder, executive director of the Great Lakes Commission, an interstate agency that promotes the development, use and conservation of water in the Great Lakes basin. So, was there a Wisconsin sale of fresh water to California before the 2008 compact? "No way. It's really simple," Eder said of Kaleka’s claim. "He’s wrong. I don’t know where he’s getting his information, but it’s not based in fact." Two other experts -- Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources water use section chief Eric Ebersberger, and Peter Annin, managing director of the University of Notre Dame Environmental Change Initiative, which does research on water resources -- were also dumbfounded and emphatic: No water sale to California has ever occurred. And if it never occurred, it certainly didn’t boost the dairy industry there, or mean lost jobs or farmland here. Indeed, federal figures show that in 2012, Wisconsin produced 27.2 billion pounds of milk, a record for the state, and led the nation by producing 2.79 billion pounds of cheese. Said Annin, author of "The Great Lakes Water Wars": "I’m not aware of any instance where the State of Wisconsin, or anybody in the state of Wisconsin, sold water to California. There’ve been a lot of weird proposals, but they’ve never actually happened." We also checked with the federal Mississippi River Commission, which assured us that water from the Mississippi River was never sold to California. Kaleka, meanwhile, told us he meant to say "we thought about sending them fresh water." He added: "I'm going to have to take my hit on this. It was a sloppy response to a very big problem of local and national economics." But on even that he is off. None of the information Kaleka provided us indicates that Wisconsin even considered selling water to California. And we could find no record of it. Our rating Kaleka said Wisconsin sold fresh water to California and "lost a bunch of jobs (and) a bunch of farmland." There’s no evidence of such a water sale, something that would have made for countless front-page stories, let alone it leading to a loss of jobs and farmland in Wisconsin. The statement is false and ridiculous: Pants on Fire. You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's web site.

pomt-06421	Congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but "zero on job creation."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/25/facebook-posts/blog-post-says-gop-has-sponsored-zero-job-creation/	A reader recently sent us a post circulating on Facebook and on blogs that blames the House Republican majority for focusing their legislation on lots of topics -- except for job creation. Here’s the text of the chart: "The numbers: Republicans have introduced 44 bills on abortion, 99 on religion, 71 on family relationships, 36 on marriage, 67 on firearms/gun control, 522 on taxation, 445 on ‘government investigations,’ and zero on job creation." It cites as its source a post on the liberal website Daily Kos written on Oct. 21, 2011, by Minnesota-based blogger and self-described "unrepentant liberal" Myles Spicer, "Given that these Representatives were elected to pass job creation bills so needed by our country, what has the House been doing this past year?" Spicer asked in his post. "Well, mostly they have occupied themselves with a variety of social, moral and value issues. ... The Congressional Research Service (CRS, a non-partisan arm of Congress that tracks such things) offers an appalling look at our current Congress’ activities. "They have introduced 44 bills on abortion (one just the other day reaffirming existing legislation on this subject). 99 on religion. 71 on family relationships. 36 on marriage. 67 on firearms and gun control. 552 on taxation—and though most were to reduce taxes, there have been no significant changes on tax law with all time invested and bills introduced. And finally a massive 445 bills on ‘government investigations.’ There is a category labeled ‘job creation legislation’ originated by Congress, and tracked by the CRS. In that category the CRS reported: ‘No bills at this time. The Congressional Research Service has not tagged any bills in the current session of Congress with this issue area.’ If ever the analogy of ‘rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic’ was apt, this is it!" We wondered about the accuracy of the post based on Spicer’s argument, so we took a look. We didn’t find anything about legislative subject headings at CRS’ own website, but we did find a list of subjects for current legislation at THOMAS, the legislative-tracking website run by the Library of Congress. Using THOMAS, you can search bills that have been offered during the current Congress -- the 112th -- by their CRS subject matter. The list of subject areas begins in alphabetical order here. When comparing the numbers, we allowed for some variation due to the list being continuously updated as new bills are introduced. That said, we found that the numbers in the Internet post were quite close to what was listed in THOMAS for abortion, religion, family relationships, marriage, firearms, taxation and government investigations. What about "job creation"? As it turned out, we couldn’t find a topic area by that name at all. We located Spicer and asked him for his sourcing. He told us he had used the website opencongress.org, a non-profit, non-partisan database of legislative and other congressional data. He pointed us to this page, where a category of bills categorized under "job creation" is listed. "Job creation" had zero entries. We quickly noticed two things about the database. First, the numbers cited on opencongress.org for the social issues and other topics in the chart were close to what THOMAS had -- in other words, they closely followed the CRS subject headings. And second, "job creation" was only one of many, many topics that had zero bills associated with it in the opencongress.org database. We reached David Moore, executive director of the Participatory Politics Foundation, which runs opencongress.org. He said that his website displays not only CRS issue labels used for bills pending in the current Congress but also labels that have been used at least once in the past three Congresses, even if none have been applied yet to bills in the 112th Congress. By Moore’s count, opencongress.org includes 4,795 issue areas in all. But only a fraction of these subject headings have any bills listed under them, because CRS has not tagged any bills with those headings during the current Congress. We did not hear back from CRS or THOMAS, so we don’t know why CRS has used the "job creation" label in the past but not this year. However, our research suggests that the lack of bills labeled "job creation" this year doesn't mean there have been no bills aimed at promoting employment introduced in the current Congress. Why? The House version of President Barack Obama’s American Jobs Act -- which we’re sure the president and his supporters would characterize as a "job creation" bill -- doesn’t even get slapped with that subject heading. The bill -- officially H.R. 12, introduced on Sept. 21, 2011, by Rep. John Larson, D-Conn. -- is listed under no fewer than 68 separate subject headings, including "aviation and airports," "Buy American requirements," "electric power generation and transmission," "Internet and video services," "metals," "solid waste and recycling" and "water use and supply." But it doesn’t carry the label "job creation." Instead, several closely related subjects have been applied to H.R. 12, including "economic development," "economic performance and conditions," "employee hiring," "employment and training programs," "labor and employment," "unemployment" and "wages and earnings." And how many bills have been introduced under these other headings? Here’s the list. (Some bills may be included in more than one category.) Economic development: 64 bills Economic performance and conditions: 55 bills Employee hiring: 24 bills Employment and training programs: 172 bills Labor and employment: 151 bills Unemployment: 107 bills Wages and earnings: 143 bills In reality, then, six of these seven jobs-related categories included more bills than either abortion or marriage, and four of the seven included more bills than religion, family relationships or firearms. We see a few additional problems with the post. It’s wrong to say that only Republicans sponsored bills on social issues, taxation and government investigations. For every legislative subject cited in the ad, the THOMAS list includes bills introduced both by Republicans and Democrats. We checked each topic area to make sure that Democrats had offered bills on those topics, and in each case, they did. So it’s wrong for the post to say that "Republicans have introduced" that many bills. Both parties have. (Spicer, to his credit, did not make this mistake; the creator of the subsequent post did. "When I state that these folks were elected to get us more jobs, I did not exclude the Democrats," Spicer told PolitiFact.) It’s wrong to point to this data as evidence that Republicans are going hog wild on "government investigations." To be sure, Republicans are using their control of House committees to probe government operations, including potential corruption and scandals. (The Democrats did the same after 2006 when they controlled Congress and George W. Bush was in the White House.) But it’s wrong to suggest that the 445 "government investigation" bills amount to evidence in support of this tendency. Most of the bills tagged with this category are there because they contain some sort of oversight mechanism, such as defining who will oversee a newly created federal program and how. So most of these bills involve run-of-the-mill government oversight mechanisms, not an effort to gin up high-profile administration scandals. Keep in mind that these categories are very broad. Labeling a bill with a subject category doesn’t mean the bill is primarily about that issue. For instance, a very, very large number of congressional bills have some impact on the tax code, even if it’s tangential. That’s why so many bills get categorized as being tax-related. To one degree or another for the other, this pattern holds for subject headings, too. The "religion" category doesn’t just include bills of interest to conservative Christians, as someone reading the post might assume. It also includes the "Noose Hate Crime Act of 2011," sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas and the "Veterans, Women, Families with Children, and Persons With Disabilities Housing Fairness Act of 2011," sponsored by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas. "Job creation" means different things to different parties. Most conservatives today are dead-set against traditional forms of government-based economic stimulus known as Keynesian economics, primarily spending initiatives. So if "job creation" is defined to primarily include Keynesian initiatives, then Republicans aren’t going to be sponsoring any "job creation" bills. Instead, Republicans argue that tax cuts and budget cutting will help the economy prosper. Our ruling While congressional Republicans have certainly introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, the claim that the GOP has focused on issues other than job creation just isn't supported. The numbers cited in the post include Democratic bills, and the definition of what constitutes a "job creation" bill is open to significant debate. But the post’s most important flaw is the contention that Republicans have offered "zero" bills on job creation. This number stems from a methodology that also excludes Obama’s American Jobs Act from the category of "job creation" bills. If you look at alternative job-related subject headings, the number of bills offered by lawmakers from both parties actually exceeds most of the social-issues listed in the blog post.

pomt-10768	He received "A" ratings from "every conservative organization that gives ratings."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/22/tom-tancredo/many-but-not-every/	During a Republican debate in Orlando, Fla., on Oct. 21, Rep. Tom Tancredo boasted about his high ratings from conservative groups. "The American Taxpayers Union, for one, gives me the highest rating; the American Conservative Union, highest rating of anybody running for president of the United States; an A rating from the National Right to Life; an A rating from every organization -- every conservative organization that gives ratings to those of us who are here on this stage." Tancredo consistently ranks near the top of Republicans when measured by conservative organizations, oftentimes earning an "A" grade. The American Conservative Union indeed gives him the highest rating -- last year alone and by lifetime average -- of any presidential candidate. Still, Tancredo manages to be a bit misleading about his credentials when claiming the "highest" rating from other groups or that "every conservative organization" has given him an "A" rating. First- there is not, to our knowledge, an organization called the "American Taxpayers Union." Since Rep. Tancredo cites his "A" grade from the "National Taxpayers Union" on his website, we'll assume he meant them. While he did garner an "A" from the National Taxpayers Union, it wasn't the highest grade among the Republicans seeking the presidency. Tancredo's 2006 score was 76%, an "A." His average score over the past 8 years was 78.4%. Rep. Ron Paul has him beat on both counts, with a 2006 score of 84% and an average of 86.9% over the past 10 years. On Tancredo's website, there's a voting record scorecard showing his receipt of "A" grades from seven conservative organizations. Omitted from that list, however, is the powerful, fiscally conservative group, The Club for Growth. The Club for Growth, known for mounting serious primary challenges against Republican incumbents it feel aren't conservative enough, has been keeping tabs on Members of Congress since 2005, said Club for Growth spokesperson Nachama Soloveichik. Tancredo's score, on a scale of 0-100, was an 88 in 2005 and an 80 in 2006. Soloveichik tells PolitiFact that although they haven't translated the numerical scores into letter grades, members must score a 90 or above to earn their "Defender of Economic Freedom Award," and Tancredo fell short of that. So overall, we give his claim a Mostly True.	None	Tom Tancredo	None	None	None	2007-10-22T00:00:00	2007-10-21	['None']
pomt-05097	Says Rep. Charles Bass "supports privatizing Social Security, risking trillions more on Wall Street."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/29/ann-mclane-kuster/ann-kuster-distorts-bass-record-social-security/	Social Security may not be in the news as much as it has in past elections, but congressional candidate Ann McLane Kuster wasted no time this month making it one of the first talking points in her 2012 election bid. Just minutes after filing her election papers, Kuster, a Concord Democrat, accused her Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. Charles Bass, of supporting the privatization of Social Security. "Unfortunately for New Hampshire, my opponent is part of the problem," Kuster told supporters during a June 7 rally outside the Statehouse. "He supports privatizing Social Security, risking trillions more on Wall Street," she said. "Our country and our state cannot support more of the same from Congressman Bass." Kuster and Bass know each other well. In the 2010 race, Bass defeated Kuster by a tight 2 percent margin. But, how well does Kuster know the Congressman’ stance on Social Security? We decided to check the records. To support Kuster’s claim, her campaign staff pointed us first to a series of votes and statements Bass has made on the matter over his years in office. Bass, a Peterborough Republican, served six terms in Congress between 1994-2006 before returning to office in 2010, and the matter of Social Security came up several times during his first years in office. In 2001, President George W. Bush launched the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security to look into the future of the institution. In December of that year, the 16-member panel issued its final report, which urged Congress to incorporate a system of private accounts for personal investment. Opposed by Democrats, the commission’s recommendations never reached the floor of Congress for a vote. But, the House did consider a number of proposed resolutions and amendments on both sides of the issue. Bass joined each of his Republican colleagues in voting against H.AMDT.245, a Democrat sponsored amendment that would have prohibited any funding of the commission’s recommendations. Kuster’s staff pointed to the amendment, which failed 188-238, as evidence of Bass’ support for privatization. But, according to analysts, the amendment was more of a partisan pre-emptive strike than a true endorsement of privatization. "He may have (supported privatization)," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute. "Republicans generally did at that point, but this vote was certainly not a vote that could be read that way." Over the years to follow, several efforts to push a privatization bill fell short at the committee level. But, Bush brought the issue to the forefront once again when he included it in his 2005 State of the Union address. In the Feb. 2, 2005 speech, the president outlined a plan for partial privatization, which he pledged to make a key part of his second term agenda. Immediately following the speech, Bass issued a written statement supporting the President’s plan, which reflected one of the recommendations of the 2001 commission. "I am an advocate of the President's call for Social Security reform and will work with him in the next two years to save and protect this important program," Bass wrote, according to the National Journal and Project Vote Smart. Six weeks later, Bass further endorsed Bush’s plan during stops in Claremont and Lebanon, N.H. "I support the establishment of private savings accounts because it allows low- and middle-income workers the chance to get ahead," Bass said, according to the Eagle Times, of Claremont. President Bush’s plan, to allow workers under 55 the option of directing up to 4 percent of their payroll taxes into private accounts, came as close as political discourse has reached in recent years to a debate over privatization. "Virtually no one has proposed replacing all of Social Security with private accounts," said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "Given the way the debate has evolved, being for ... privatization doesn't mean you’re for privatizing the whole darn thing." In past rulings, PolitiFact has determined that the private accounts proposal does not meet the definition of full privatization. In August of 2010, President Barack Obama earned a Mostly False ruling on a similar claim about Congressional Republicans, and later that month, Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln earned the same rating on a claim about her opponent, Rep. John Boozman. Bass’ position on Social Security, like those of other Republicans addressed in these past PolitiFact pieces, is in support of giving taxpayers the option of investing in private Social Security accounts, according to campaign spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne. "To address this financial crisis facing the Social Security program, one such idea Congressman Bass has supported would create a program that would allow individuals to voluntarily place a portion of their money that they currently pay as part of the payroll tax and place it into a personal account," Tranchemontagne wrote in an email to The Telegraph. "Saying that (he) supports ‘privatizing Social Security’ is pure political rhetoric devised by Democrat spin doctors to frighten seniors." Our ruling: Bass, like most other Congressional Republicans at the time, supported President Bush’s plan to introduce the option of private savings account into the Social Security equation. This partial privatization plan would have brought change to the system, but, as PolitiFact has ruled in the past, it would not affect people older than 55 and it does not meet the criteria for full privatization, as Kuster claims.

pomt-02728	"We don’t show people playing these games. We don’t show them winning playing the video lottery games."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/19/jack-roberts/does-oregon-lottery-show-people-playing-and-winnin/	The Oregon Lottery has churned plenty of money into the state’s coffers since its inception in 1984. It’s now a $500 million-a-year cash cow, with 86 percent of that coming from video slot and poker machines. Of course those proceeds also mean big losses for players. Many of them, as The Oregonian’s Harry Esteve showed in a recent series on the Oregon Lottery, are problem gamblers who lose thousands of dollars a year playing video lottery machines. Jack Roberts, who became the Oregon Lottery director Dec. 1, 2013, took issue with the series and its contention that the lottery uses "aggressive" marketing to get people to play video slots. In a Dec. 11, 2013, interview on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s "Think Out Loud" radio show, he defended lottery advertising. "We’re very careful in terms of our marketing," said Roberts, Oregon’s former labor commissioner. "We don’t show people playing these games. We don’t show them winning playing the video lottery games." But we had seen an ad that showed people playing and wondered whether that’s true. PolitiFact Oregon decided to get to the bottom of it. The lottery has several ads, including print, radio and television spots. Some talk about how money from the lottery helps parks or fish habitat, for example. Others encourage people to buy scratch-off tickets. PolitiFact Oregon also found two videos on the lottery website, one that is also being shown on television. The one that appears on television shows a young woman zipping up a life vest to paddle a kayak on the Willamette River. It also shows a man putting on a helmet for a motorcycle ride. A voice-over talks about gambling responsibly by setting a time limit and a budget as the video shows someone setting a smartphone timer for 20 minutes and circling "Entertainment" on a sheet of paper next to a "150." Then it shows the woman and man playing an Oregon Lottery video game and breaking into broad smiles, the man pumping his fists, after the woman pushes the button. The second video can be viewed only on the lottery’s website by clicking the words "Click here to see how much fun Video Lottery can be." It shows various people smiling and laughing as they play Oregon Lottery slot machines. In one scene, three people cheer and clap as they win; the video shows three fives lined up on the game screen. In another scene, two people brim with elation and high-five as they look at a video game screen. At the end, a voice tells viewers that "Lottery games are based on chance and should be played for entertainment only." Next we contacted Roberts’ office in Salem and asked about his assertion. Through lottery spokesman Chuck Baumann, Roberts provided this statement: "My reference to marketing referred to our advertisements for the lottery. I was not referring to our responsible gambling ads, where we believe it helps to show people gambling in order to demonstrate what responsible gambling means. Even these ads mainly show side shots of the machines and do not portray players winning a jackpot or celebrating their winnings. My statement was in response to accusations that we run ads glorifying gambling in order to attract more players. In fact, we do not." We called Jeff Marotta, who works with problem gamblers and who, until recently, belonged to a lottery advisory group. Marotta, president and senior consultant at Problem Gambling Solutions, said he had seen the "kayaking and motorcycling" ad on television for the first time the night before. However, it wasn’t the first time he’d seen the ad. He saw it in September, when lottery officials asked him to critique new responsible-gambling ads showing people playing "VLTs," -- or video lottery terminals. "The images in the final segment of these ads show men playing VLTs with attractive women by their sides, smiling at the man and the machine," Marotta wrote to lottery officials in a memo dated Sept. 25, 2013. "The message that VLTs are fun and attractive are further accentuated by the peppy music, announcer tone, choice of actors, association with cool activities…" He ended the memo by writing, "In sum, these responsible gambling ads could be viewed as wolves in sheep’s clothing and in my opinion should not be aired." Marotta told us his long-term contract to advise lottery officials was terminated soon after. "Was it this that burned my bridge with them?" he said. "Maybe. I’ll never know for sure." Roberts, in a follow-up email, noted that he became director after Marotta’s departure as a consultant. He added, "Our advertisements about responsible gambling are in fulfillment of our obligation to operate the lottery in a manner commensurate with the public interest." He did not elaborate on his earlier claim that the ads don’t show people playing or winning video games. But Baumann, in a later phone conversation, said Roberts had not seen the website-only video at the time of his OPB comments. It’s true that Roberts had been on the job less than two weeks when he made the statement on OPB and understandable that he had not seen one of the ads. The lottery has many ads, and the website has many pages. The kayaking ad is more problematic. The Oregon Lottery does classify it as a "responsible gambling" ad. But Roberts, on OPB, said of lottery marketing: "We don’t show people playing these games. We don’t show them winning playing the video lottery games." He didn’t mention a distinction. Neither would that distinction be clear to viewers. And as Marotta noted, the ad -- showing young, attractive people having a great time -- would be unlikely to dissuade people from gambling. Finally, despite Roberts’ statement on OPB, even the kayaking ad clearly shows people not only playing but enthusiastically smiling and reacting to an apparent win. We find Roberts’ statement False.

pomt-14571	Says she "is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors (John) Kasich and (Chris) Christie combined."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/08/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-her-campaign-has-more-cash-hand/	When Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was denied a spot in a debate just days before the New Hampshire primary, she took to Medium to argue her case. Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, compared herself to some other Republican candidates in the race, including Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. She wrote, "Despite what the media is telling you, it is clear that Carly deserved to be on the debate stage, both according to their arbitrary metrics — and the ones that actually matter: "In an actual contest of voters, Carly came out ahead of Governors Christie and Kasich. "She has the same number of delegates as Governor Bush. Governor Christie has 0. "Carly is 6th in hard dollars raised and has more cash on hand than Governors Kasich and Christie combined." Fiorina never managed to snag a spot at the debate, but we decided to take a look at the third of Fiorina’s bullet points -- the one about about her fundraising totals. (For the record, she was right on both of the previous two bullet points. Fiorina got 3,485 votes in Iowa, or 1.9 percent, which was ahead of Kasich by 11 votes and ahead of Christie by 201 votes. That translated into one delegate each for Bush and Fiorina and none for Christie.) For fundraising data, we turned to opensecrets.org for the latest presidential fundraising data. Here’s the table, in descending order, for hard dollars raised, defined as money raised by the candidate’s own campaign committee. The most recent data available at the time of her Feb. 6 statement was through Dec. 31, 2015. (Opensecrets.org does not have data for one Republican candidate still in the race, former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore.) Candidate Hard dollars raised 1. Ben Carson $54,036,610 2. Ted Cruz $47,086,857 3. Jeb Bush $31,922,100 4. Marco Rubio $29,710,092 5. Donald Trump $19,405,217 6. Carly Fiorina $11,349,057 7. John Kasich $7,582,365 8. Chris Christie $7,159,329 So Fiorina was indeed sixth on the list. That’s not saying a whole lot -- she was ahead of only two candidates, and she had barely half the amount of the fifth-place finisher. How about cash on hand, which means money raised minus money already spent? Candidate Cash on hand 1. Ted Cruz $18,734,794 2. Marco Rubio $10,398,593 3. Jeb Bush $7,589,858 4. Donald Trump $6,964,325 5. Ben Carson $6,567,647 6. Carly Fiorina $4,484,307 7. John Kasich $2,537,301 8.

pomt-07258	Says state budget deal between Texas House and Senate leaders "funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities and provides financial aid for college students."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/may/27/joe-straus/speaker-straus-says-state-budget-deal-funds-nursin/	Joe Straus, the Texas House speaker, recently joined Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in announcing a compromise between House and Senate negotiators on the 2012-13 state budget. Straus elaborated in a May 20 press release: "The agreement that we reached with the Senate today funds nursing homes, our public schools and universities, and provides financial aid for college students while keeping substantial revenue in reserves and avoiding any new taxes." Check on keeping money in reserve and not raising taxes. But is it fiscally defensible to crow about funding education and nursing homes in this tight budget cycle? To our inquiry, Straus spokeswoman Tracy Young pointed out that specific numbers wouldn’t be available until the inked deal was published as the proposed budget. In the meantime, we turned to news reports on the budget deal, which was reached months after the state comptroller’s revenue forecast for 2012-13 left lawmakers grappling with a projected shortfall of more than $20 billion to maintain existing spending or services. First, let’s look at the public schools. The Austin American-Statesman noted May 24 that the agreement gives public school districts $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would get under current law. Lynn Moak, a lobbyist whose clients include an alliance of large school districts, told us it allocates about $37 billion to districts -- "less money for schools than schools were counting on under the normal school formula process." But Moak said districts will be "a lot better off" than they would have been under the first House-approved budget, which would have given the schools at least $7.8 billion less than they stood to draw under existing formulas. And state support for higher education? Overall, the agreement cuts that funding about 10 percent in 2012-13, the Dallas Morning News reported May 23. Specifics include: a 25 percent reduction in a fund to help universities reach elite status as research institutions; a 5 percent cut in general academic funding formulas and a 10 percent cut in funding for the state’s nine health science centers, the newspaper said. Also, the number of Texas college students getting state-backed scholarships will drop by 41,000 from the 153,738 students now getting that aid, the News reported. That’s a 25 percent hit. That includes 29,000 fewer poor and lower-midde-income students who will receive TEXAS Grants, intended for poor and lower-middle-income children. Then again, the budget deal protects formula funding and scholarships at community colleges, state Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas told the Morning News. We ran the higher education numbers by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, whose spokesman, Dominic Chavez, said state aid to higher ed is actually slated to drop about 8 percent in 2012-13. He said all state-backed college financial aid will decrease 23 percent, with 43,258 fewer students benefiting. To gauge funding for nursing homes, we contacted the Texas Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which advocates at the Capitol for about 100 nonprofit nursing homes. Spokesman David Thomason said the budget agreement maintains an already-imposed 3 percent reduction in the rate paid for serving nursing-home residents on Medicaid -- more than erasing the 2.7 percent rate increase approved by the 2009 Legislature. Thomason said the association doesn’t expect homes to close due to the lowered Medicaid rate, but he predicted staffing reductions and fewer nursing-home slots available to Texans on Medicaid. Summing up, public schools stand to field $4 billion less in 2012-13 than they would have gotten under current law. Higher education, except for community colleges, is likewise due to sustain funding cuts plus a drop in state-supported scholarships. Nursing homes are left with lower rates than they had after the 2009 legislative session. Straus is correct the agreed-upon budget "funds" these items, but his statement fails to acknowledge the funding is mostly at lower levels than before. That’s vital missing context. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Joe Straus	None	None	None	2011-05-27T06:00:00	2011-05-20	['Texas_House_of_Representatives']
pomt-12416	Before Obamacare, Wisconsin’s "high-risk pool" for health insurance "had eight or nine" plans to choose from, people "could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted, and their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/19/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-claim-wisconsin-being-model-covering-pe/	The Affordable Care Act put an end to insurance companies charging higher health insurance premiums to people for having a pre-existing condition. But the Republican replacement for Obamacare would make that practice possible again. GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan says not to worry, just look at how his home state of Wisconsin took care of people with pre-existing conditions before Obamacare. So let’s see what case he's making. The claim On May 7, 2017, three days after the House of Representatives narrowly approved the Obamacare replacement, Ryan appeared on ABC’s "This Week." He said that under the bill, labeled "Trumpcare" by some Democrats, states could ask for a waiver from the federal government that would allow insurance companies to charge higher rates for a pre-existing condition for people who had a lapse in health insurance coverage. But those higher premiums could be charged only if states also established a so-called high-risk pool or provided some other type of financial assistance that would help those people buy insurance. Ryan held up the Badger State as a model for how things could work under the GOP bill, saying: In Wisconsin, we had a really successful high-risk pool. Ten percent of the people in the individual market in Wisconsin were in the state high-risk pool. They had eight or nine plans to choose from. They could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted. And their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today. We'll check Ryan’s three-part claim, which he repeated on the Fox News Channel. He’s essentially on target on the first two parts, but not on the third. What’s a high-risk pool? The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation helps explain the rationale for creating high-risk pools: the sickest 10 percent of the population accounts for nearly two-thirds of all health spending. But questions remain about the effectiveness of high-risk pools and whether there would be enough public dollars allocated to them under the GOP bill to make insurance affordable for people with preexisting conditions. Wisconsin’s high-risk pool "was a lifesaver" for those it served, Kaiser health reform and private insurance senior fellow Karen Pollitz told us. But it served only some of the people who were eligible, and for it to be viable nationally, "you would have to put down a whole lot of money, more than has been put in the House bill so far," she said. Wisconsin’s high-risk pool -- the Wisconsin Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan -- operated from 1979 through 2013. It was funded through policyholder premiums, reduced payments to health care providers and financial assessments on health insurance companies. At the end, it insured 21,000 people and was regarded as among the most successful programs in the country, even though not everyone with preexisting conditions who needed coverage could afford it. Also, Wisconsin’s high-risk pool did not contain the same coverages as Obamacare plans -- for example, it had a lifetime limit for benefits, whereas Obamacare does not. So, understanding the limited nature of Wisconsin’s high-risk pool, we go to the three parts of Ryan’s claim. Ryan’s claim Ryan was close on the number of plans available in Wisconsin’s high-risk pool. There were seven options (not eight or nine) in place with deductibles ranging from $1,000 to $7,500, although one was only for Medicare recipients seeking supplemental coverage. Ryan also was close on provider availability. All hospitals and doctors who were Medicaid-certified could be used by high-risk pool recipients. That included all hospitals in the state and the vast majority of doctors, said Sam Austin, a health policy analyst at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Population Health Institute and the author of a 2013 Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau report on the state’s high-risk pool. Finally, Ryan’s staff pointed out that Wisconsin’s deputy insurance commissioner has told Congress that people in the high-risk pool had to pay more for coverage under Obamacare. But it can’t be flatly stated that all premiums and co-payments in the high-risk pool were lower than those under Obamacare, Austin and other experts told us. As we noted, under options available in the high-risk pool and under Obamacare, premiums, deductibles, coverages and subsidies all vary. Kaiser’s Pollitz told us that if medical inflation were taken into account, the Wisconsin high-risk pool costs would generally be higher than the current Obamacare rates. And high-risk pools expert Jean Hall, a Kansas University health policy professor, told us that low-income people who qualify for subsidies under Obamacare are getting more coverage for less money than they were with Wisconsin’s high-risk pool -- even if there were cases where people with higher incomes got a better deal with the pool. Our rating Ryan says that before Obamacare, Wisconsin’s high-risk pool for health insurance "had eight or nine" plans to choose from, people "could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted, and their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today." The House speaker slightly overstates the number of plans and the availability of providers, but is generally on target. But it can’t be flatly stated that the high-risk pool plans were cheaper than Obamacare plans for comparable coverage. For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Ryan a Half True.
