pomt-04000	Florida has "the second-lowest (campaign) contribution limit in the entire country."	false	/florida/statements/2013/feb/08/will-weatherford/will-weatherford-says-floridas-campaign-contributi/	Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford does not have kind words for the state’s $500 limit on individual campaign contributions. He’s called the cap archaic, emasculating and ineffective, saying lawmakers bypass the $500 per election threshold by raising unlimited amounts of money from loosely regulated political committees. Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, says increasing the limit on individual campaign contributions will make Florida’s campaign finance system more transparent. "We have the second-lowest contribution limit in the entire country," Weatherford said in driving home the point to news editors and reporters in Tallahassee on Jan. 30, 2013. Later that day, Weatherford unveiled House legislation that would increase the individual donation limit to $10,000 and get rid of the political committees that Weatherford says have been prone to abuse. We decided to circle back to Weatherford’s comment about Florida’s lower-than-most contribution limit. Weatherford is referring to the maximum amount a person can contribute to a candidate for state office per an election. According to the Florida Department of State, a "person" in campaign finance terms is defined broadly to include "an individual or a corporation, association, firm, partnership, joint venture, joint stock company, club, organization, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate or other combination of individuals having collective capacity." So each "person" can contribute $500 for a primary and $500 for a general election, or $1,000 total. The same person can also contribute another $1,000 for a business they own. Or if they own 10 businesses, they can contribute an additional $10,000. And so on. Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy directed us to a breakdown of campaign limits across states by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Duffy said Florida is actually tied for the second-lowest limit, with Maine being the state with the lowest limit ($350). But it’s not a simple apples-to-apples comparison. Florida’s $500 limit -- or $1,000 if you include the primary and general election -- is the same for all state races (House, Senate, Cabinet and governor), but limits in other states vary according to the race. In Connecticut, for instance, individual donations max out at $3,500 per election for gubernatorial candidates (more than Florida), $1,000 for state Senate races (the same) and $250 for state House races (and less). Some states have different contribution limits for election years and non-election years. And instead of counting donations for each election, like Florida, some states strictly look at donation tallies per calendar year. Point being, it’s pretty complicated. So we went to the experts. NCSL senior fellow Jennie Bowser provided us a list of 12 states that have the same or lower contribution limits as Florida in certain situations. (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana and Wisconsin). A few examples, from the NCSL: * Candidates for Legislature in Delaware can receive a total of $600 in contributions (counting the primary and general election). * Candidates for Legislature in Montana can receive a total of $320 in contributions (counting the primary and general election). * Candidates for Legislature in Colorado can receive a total of $400 in contributions (counting the primary and general election). In each case, that compares to $1,000 in Florida. Weatherford’s point would be closer to accurate if he were talking solely about contributions to a candidate for governor, Bowser said. Alaska’s limit is the same as Florida’s as long as the total amount is given in two separate contributions, each in a different calendar year. Arizona’s $872 limit is the lowest. Our ruling Weatherford claimed Florida’s direct campaign contribution limit is the second-lowest limit in the country. Florida’s limit ($500 per election) is low compared to some states, though it’s not that low when you consider that people can make multiple contributions using business entities. But even still, Weatherford errs in trying to make a sweeping comparison because states don’t have an across-the-board limit. We rate his claim False.

pomt-09349	On financial reform, there is "a million dollars being spent, per congressman, in lobbying expenses on this issue. (The) industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate working on this."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/07/lawrence-summers/financial-reform-draws-many-lobbyists/	The Obama administration is pushing Democratic proposals to more heavily regulate Wall Street and the financial sector. In light of the 2008 financial crisis and the ongoing recession, some might think that would be easy to achieve. But that's not the case, said Lawrence Summers, one of President Barack Obama's top economic advisers. "I expect that reform is going to pass. It's not easy. You've got a million dollars being spent, per congressman, in lobbying expenses on this issue. (The) industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate working on this," Summers said, when asked about the prospects for financial reform on ABC News' This Week. The new regulations are still being formulated. A bill in the Senate would create a council to watch for systemic threats to the financial system, and it would allow the Federal Reserve to oversee different types of financial institutions, not just banks. We wanted to check Summers' statements that a million dollars was being spent per congressman, and that there were four lobbyists for every member of the House and Senate working on it. To analyze his statements, we turned to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group that has spent 25 years tracking money in politics. Much of their work involves the analysis of mandated disclosure documents for campaign finance and lobbying. The most recent documents cover the year 2009; the filings for the first quarter of 2010 are due April 20. The center analyzed spending on lobbyists by sector, with finance, insurance and real estate grouped into one category. For 2009, that sector's spending totaled just over $455 million. There are 435 members of U.S. House of Representatives, so that is more than $1 million per member. One could make an argument that senators are also technically members of Congress, but Summers said "congressmen," which typically means House members. Summers also said that the industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate. The finance, insurance and real estate sector employed 2,597 lobbyists in 2009, according to the center. Add 100 senators to the 435 House members and you get 535; that's 4.85 lobbyists for every member of Congress. We must add a few cautions about these numbers. The insurance category includes a few health insurers, a group not likely to be lobbying on financial reform. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, for example, spent $14.3 million on lobbyists in 2009, and America's Health Insurance Plans spent $8.9 million. But other types of insurers would be interested in financial reform, because the legislation gives new authority to for the government to wind down failing companies that are not banks. Additionally, the financial sector lobbies on some issues that are not strictly related to financial regulations. The American Bankers Association, for example, used seven lobbyists in 2009 to influence a major appropriations bill, according to the center. Still, there's reason to think that the center's numbers come pretty close to the mark, said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics. "As soon as the Obama administration came into office, it was evident that something was going to happen," he said. "This was a major issue last year and continues to be a major issue this year." On taking office, Obama said one of his top priorities was new financial regulations, and legislators were working on them for much of 2009. The House of Representatives approved a bill on Dec. 11; the Senate has yet to vote on a bill. Though the financial sector faced significant setbacks during the crisis of fall 2008, the sector's spending on lobbying in 2009 kept pace with or exceeded spending in previous years, Levinthal said. Getting back to Summers' statement, he said, there is "a million dollars being spent, per congressman, in lobbying expenses on this issue. (The) industry has four lobbyists per member of the House and Senate working on this." There may be cases in which the financial sector did not spend the entirety of its $455 million in lobbying money strictly on financial regulation during 2009, or examples when some of its 2,597 lobbyists did not work financial regulation. But it's clearly one of the industry's top issues. And the analysis here is based on public records and disclosures. So we rate Summers' statement Mostly True.

pomt-14084	"Every Republican nominee since Richard Nixon, who at one time was under an audit, has released their tax returns."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/may/18/chris-wallace/most-gop-nominees-1970s-have-released-their-tax-re/	It seems every political reporter is asking: Where are Donald Trump’s tax returns? The presumptive Republican nominee for president has refused to release his tax returns thus far, citing an IRS audit. Presidential candidates are not required to release tax returns, but the information helps the public vet a candidate’s finances, revealing information such as charitable giving, investments and the tax rate he pays. The IRS has said recently that an audit does not bar a person from releasing their own tax information. On the Democratic side of the race, Sen. Bernie Sanders has released his 2014 returns, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has released annual returns going back to 2000. In a May 15 interview with Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace noted that it’s become customary over the past several decades for presidential candidates to release their tax returns. "He says that he's not going to release them until an IRS audit is complete," Wallace said, speaking of Trump. "He was asked this week what his effective tax rate is, he said it's none of your business. Look, you know, you talk about this, but every Republican nominee since Richard Nixon, who at one time was under an audit, has released their tax returns." Noting that it was "not good" that Mitt Romney stalled on releasing his tax returns in the 2012 race, Priebus said, "I'm not sure whether Americans actually care or not whether Donald Trump releases his taxes or not." We’ve looked into the history of candidate tax returns before. But we haven’t dug into the story of former President Richard Nixon’s audit, so we thought we should put Wallace’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter. Every Republican nominee since Nixon The Tax History Project has compiled the tax returns of many current and former candidates and presidents, all the way back to Franklin Roosevelt’s 1913 returns. Each Republican nominee in the past nine presidential elections has released his tax returns: Ronald Reagan (1980, 1984), George H. W. Bush (1988, 1992), Bob Dole (1996), George W. Bush (2000, 2004), John McCain (2008) and Mitt Romney (2012). That leaves one nominee since Nixon, Nixon’s vice president, Gerald Ford. Ford assumed the role of president after Nixon resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal. Ford ran for re-election as the Republican nominee in 1976, ultimately losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter. Ford never released his full tax returns. He released summary data about his returns from 1966 through 1974. The summary data includes his total income and the total tax he paid but not an itemized breakdown. ‘Well, I am not a crook’ Back to Nixon. Nixon did not release his tax returns in 1968 or 1972. The IRS audited Nixon in 1973, when questions bubbled up about a fishy charitable donation and speculation that Nixon had tried to game the tax system, according to a paper prepared for the United States Capitol Historical Society. (This happened around the same time as the Watergate investigation but was a separate issue.) Nixon said one of his most well-known lines amid this scandal: "People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I am not a crook." Nixon eventually released a slew of financial information to the public in December 1973, including the previous four years of tax returns, to try to quell the criticism. He asked a congressional committee to examine them, too. However, the congressional investigation ultimately found that Nixon owed $476,431 (approximately $2.3 million in today’s dollars) in unpaid taxes and accrued interest. Oops. We asked Joe Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, if the IRS has audited any presidents or presidential candidates since Nixon. He said he doesn’t know — and it would be impossible to know unless the auditee volunteered that information because the IRS can’t confirm or deny anything about a particular taxpayer. Thorndike added, though, that he thinks it’s likely the IRS has audited candidates and presidents in recent years. "Our lack of knowledge about presidential and candidate audits is one reason why it’s important for public officials to release their tax returns publicly," he said. "Disclosure is the only way voters can be sure that these returns are getting adequate scrutiny." Our ruling Wallace said, "Every Republican nominee since Richard Nixon, who at one time was under an audit, has released their tax returns." The IRS did audit Nixon, and he did release his tax returns. But he released them after he won re-election. His successor, Ford, released a tax summary spanning several years but never his full returns. That being said, every Republican nominee since then — six nominees over nine elections — has disclosed their tax returns. Wallace’s telling of history is a little off, though the force of his point is correct: The Republican has released his tax returns in the last nine presidential cycles. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Chris Wallace	None	None	None	2016-05-18T10:30:00	2016-05-15	['Richard_Nixon', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09186	"ObamaCare will use your tax dollars to provide free Viagra to convicted rapists and registered sex offenders."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/01/cathie-adams/gop-chair-says-health-care-law-provides-free-viagr/	In a recent fund-raising letter, Cathie Adams, who chairs the Republican Party of Texas, associates Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, with abortion, higher taxes and federal legislation to cap emissions of greenhouse gases. Adams also charges White with undue silence on the recently adopted federal health care overhaul, listing among criticisms an eyebrow-raising benefit for certain men. It "was recently revealed that ObamaCare will use your tax dollars to provide free Viagra to convicted rapists and registered sex offenders," Adams writes. How, um, uplifting. Is government really fronting free erectile-dysfunction drugs to rapists and sex offenders? The GOP didn't respond to our inquiries, but we found an April 2 memo on the topic prepared by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), which analyzes issues for members of Congress. At the request of Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican opposed to the Democratic-steered health care plan, the CRS examined whether the legislation that Obama signed into law in March "would prohibit a health insurance plan that participates in an American Health Benefit Exchange created (by the act) from covering drugs prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction if the plan beneficiary is a convicted rapist, child molester or other sex offender." Some background: By 2014, under the law, states must create exchanges where individuals can buy insurance from a choice of four plans that must meet minimum standards, though premiums, out-of-pocket costs and benefits may differ. To limit costs for indigent residents, premiums and costs such as deductibles and co-payments will be subsidized for people with incomes between 133 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2009 ranged from $29,327 to $88,200 for a family of four. For example, people with incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level will only be responsible for one-third of their out-of-pocket costs; the federal government will pay for the rest. Any legal resident who doesn't have access to affordable health insurance through their employer (and isn't incarcerated) would qualify for the exchanges. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, about 704,700 sex offenders are registered in the United States (including the District of Columbia and U.S. territories). About 59,000 live in Texas. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does number-crunching for Congress, estimated in March that by 2019, approximately 24 million people would purchase their own coverage through the insurance exchanges. Of those, about 19 million are expected to be subsidized. So while not everyone who participates in the exchanges will qualify for federal subsidies, the vast majority will. The CBO also estimates that the average subsidy will amount to $6,000 per person, costing $350 billion by 2019. CRS said that an insurance plan through the health exchange must include basic coverage, including prescription drugs, and the law does "not appear to prohibit... coverage for drugs prescribed to treat ED for a non-incarcerated beneficiary who was previously convicted of rape, child molestation or another sex offense.” Nor, the memo states, would those individuals "appear to be excluded from enrolling in a qualified health plan offered through an American Health Benefit Exchange in their state solely because of that conviction." Coburn tried to create such an exclusion in March, when he introduced an amendment to the health care bill. Coburn said then that "the vast majority of Americans don't want their taxpayer dollars paying for this kind of drug for those kinds of people." The amendment also prohibited coverage of drugs that induce an abortion. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., encouraged his colleagues to reject the amendment, which failed 57-42. "This is a serious bill," Baucus said. "This is a serious debate. The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of the Senate, the debate and the American people... It is a crass political stunt aimed at making 30-second commercials, not public policy." Democrats argued that any amendments would attract negative votes, effectively killing the bill, since the margin for passage was so thin. Coburn made the CRS memo public in April. "Providing child molesters with taxpayer-funded Viagra shows the folly of government-run health care. Senators who allowed this to happen will be haunted by this vote for years to come," said Coburn spokesman John Hart, according to Roll Call, a Capitol Hill publication. Jim Manley, spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said: "This is just another attempt at hype by Sen. Coburn as he goes about trying to make a mockery of the legislative process." This isn't the first time sex offenders using government aid to obtain Viagra has drawn attention. A May 2005 audit by New York comptroller Alan Hevesi showed that between January 2000 and March 2005, 198 sex offenders in New York had received Medicaid-reimbursed Viagra after their convictions, according to an article by the Associated Press. The comptroller's office discovered the state was helping sex offenders pay for Viagra by comparing Medicaid pharmacy expenditures against the state's sex offender registry. A survey by the Associated Press found that 14 states, including Texas, had provided Medicaid-funded Viagra to nearly 800 sex offenders. In a letter to Health and Human Services, Hevesi urged the department to "take immediate action to ensure that sex offenders do not receive erectile dysfunction medication paid for by taxpayers." The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promptly sent a letter to state Medicaid directors directing them to "prevent inappropriate Medicaid payment for such drugs in the case of a sex offender." "Under the Medicaid statute, states are obligated to prevent fraud, abuse, gross overuse, or inappropriate or medically unnecessary care, among physicians, pharmacists and patients," the letter says. "A state can find that the use of certain drugs and the treatment of impotence for such individuals could constitute fraud, abuse or inappropriate use. We believe that, in accordance with such provisions, the use of these drugs in the case of a sex offender is not appropriate and Medicaid should not pay for the cost of such drugs in such circumstances." Also that month, in Texas, Attorney General Greg Abbott examined records dating to 1999 and found that nearly 200 registered sex offenders had obtained Viagra and other sex-enhancing drugs using Medicaid benefits. The Legislature soon approved an amendment, which passed into law, instructing the Health and Human Services Commission to deny erectile dysfunction drug coverage to sex offenders through Medicaid. Whither Adams' charge? She frames the prospect of free Viagra for sex offenders too simply. Yes, the CRS memo says plans offered through the exchanges aren't barred by the new law from offering just such a benefit. But the plans won't be finalized until 2014. Besides, anyone who joins such a plan will have to qualify for subsidies based on income. Also, no drugs will be free. We rate her statement as Half True.

pomt-00104	The pipe bombs were never mailed.	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/29/blog-posting/claim-pipe-bombs-werent-mailed-false/	As "false flag" conspiracy theories take hold in the wake of reports that pipe bombs were sent to critics of President Donald Trump, some Facebook users are pointing to a picture of a package as evidence explosives were never even mailed. One image that appeared on Facebook on Oct. 25 shows what looks like a manila envelope addressed to "John Brenan," misspelling the former CIA director’s name (it should be "Brennan"). The name of the sender on the package is "Debbie Wasserman Shultz." (The Florida congresswoman’s name, "Schultz," is also misspelled.) There are also six "Forever Stamps" featuring the American flag in the right corner. "6 postage stamps $2.94," reads the white text stamped on the image posted to Facebook. "Look closer. Who among you has mailed anything? A pipe bomb uses steel piping. Packages are charged shipping by weight. Do you think 6 stamps would cover that package? Wake up!" Another Facebook user posted a similar claim Oct. 24. These posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what we know. On Oct. 26, a Florida man named Cesar Sayoc Jr. was arrested on suspicion of sending explosive packages to Brennan, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama among others. According to a federal criminal complaint posted online by The New York Times, "Sayoc mailed approximately 13 packages containing improvised explosive devices (‘IEDs’) to certain current and former U.S. government officials, politicians, and others, including mailings across state lines." The complaint goes on to say that Sayoc "knowingly caused to be delivered by mail … the IEDs." Each of the 13 IEDs was "packaged in a tan-colored manila envelope lined with bubble wrap," the complaint says. "Each was stamped with approximately six self-adhesive postage stamps each bearing a picture of an American flag. Each envelope listed a return sender of "Debbie Wasserman Shultz." News media including The New York Times have published images of the envelope like the one that showed up on Facebook. The complaint describes such a package containing an IED—made with approximately six inches of PVC pipe, a small clock, a battery, wiring and energetic material—delivered via U.S. mail to George Soros’s home among others in October. After interviewing U.S. Postal Service employees, federal officials determined that between about Oct. 18 and Oct. 20, packages sent to Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Robert De Niro, Maxine Waters and Joe Biden were routed through the USPS Royal Palm Mail Processing Center in Opa-Locka, Florida. So bloggers are right that the packages had six stamps, but the pipes used to make the IEDs were lightweight plastic, not steel. CBS News reported on Oct. 26 that investigators think whoever put the devices together was trying to keep the weight down so that they could drop them in a mailbox without having to go to a post office. We rate this statement False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-10-29T18:18:57	2018-10-25	['None']
pomt-01804	"We've recovered (from the recession) faster and come farther than almost any other advanced country on Earth."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/23/barack-obama/obama-us-has-recovered-recession-better-almost-eve/	While his critics decry his economic policies, President Barack Obama keeps insisting that he’s had economic success. In a speech in Wilmington, Del., last week, Obama offered several pieces of evidence that, in his view, suggests that the country is rebounding from the recession. Unemployment is at its lowest rate since 2008, he noted; the auto industry is "booming," America is making more oil than it imports, and the deficit has been cut in half, he added. All told, Obama said, "we’ve recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced country on Earth." That final claim got our attention, so we took a closer look. The evidence We asked the White House for evidence to back up Obama’s claim, and they pointed us to their annual economic report to Congress. According to the report, the United States is "one of only two of the 12 countries that experienced systemic financial crises in 2007 and 2008 but have seen real (gross domestic product) per working-age person return to pre-crisis levels." The 12 countries are France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States. Germany is the only other country of these 12 in that category -- that is, that has seen its GDP per person age 16 to 64 return to its pre-recession level. Here’s the summary chart from the White House report: This provides evidence for Obama’s claim, because, aside from Germany, all the other countries in this category haven’t yet returned to their pre-recession level at all. So, case closed? Not quite. There are many ways to measure the economy beyond real GDP per working age. And while the 12 countries studied in the report all experienced bank crises during the recession, Obama’s statement was broader than that -- he said "almost any other advanced country on Earth." (The list of the most "advanced countries on Earth" also usually doesn’t include Ukraine.) So we ran this measurement past some experts. In general, they agreed with the tenor of Obama’s claim, but said it wasn’t as simple as relying on the chart the White House provided. "The general sentiment is quite right," said Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University. "But to evaluate the statement in its sweeping form, one would have to look at more countries, and one should look at other possible measures of economic performance." Additional measurements On the experts’ recommendations, we looked at inflation-adjusted gross domestic product, as well as unemployment rates, in a wider selection of advanced countries. We used data from the International Monetary Fund, which considers 36 economies to be "advanced." For each of these 36 countries, we calculated the growth between their worst point in GDP and unemployment to 2013, the last year for which full data is available. Positive growth in GDP is good, while negative growth in unemployment is desirable. Each value that is better than the United States’ (the last country on the list) is highlighted in bold-italic. (The raw data is here.) Country GDP Unemploym. Country GDP Unemploym. Australia 13.01% 1.49% Korea 15.98% -16.11% Austria 5.93% 2.45% Latvia 15.36% -36.44% Belgium 4.25% 1.82% Luxembourg 6.93% 17.72% Canada 9.96% -14.58% Malta 8.57% -6.14% Cyprus -6.66% 155.94% Netherlands 0.39% 54.15% Czech Republic 2.37% -4.48% New Zealand 9.18% -6.22% Denmark 2.55% -6.25% Norway 5.30% -2.26% Estonia 17.76% -48.36% Portugal -3.90% 50.52% Finland 3.76% -2.87% San Marino -15.98% 61.78% France 4.08% 11.14% Singapore 29.34% -37.19% Germany 8.93% -32.12% Slovak Republic 10.51% -2.20% Greece -16.92% 117.47% Slovenia -1.72% 39.40% Hong Kong 16.96% -40.30% Spain -2.79% 31.38% Iceland 7.10% -45.41% Sweden 12.39% -6.71% Ireland 1.98% -5.83% Switzerland 7.98% -14.67% Israel 19.48% -32.10% Taiwan 19.58% -28.55% Italy -2.09% 45.31% United Kingdom 4.86% -3.13% Japan 7.31% -20.30% United States 9.32% -23.64% So the United States has clearly done better in expanding GDP and lowering unemployment than most of the economies deemed "advanced" by the IMF. Still, some countries have fared better, particularly in Asia. It is also worth nothing that some countries, like Estonia, have seen an improvement in GDP, yet their GDP has not yet returned to pre-recession levels. Among the countries beyond the United States that are doing well are Canada, Germany and Switzerland. Israel and some Asian countries, such as Korea and Singapore, have seen improvements as good or better than the United States' in recent years, but they were not as dramatically affected by the recession as North America and Europe. Austan Goolsbee, Obama’s former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (which prepares the White House’s annual economic report), pointed to an IMF paper from April, "World Economic Outlook: Recovery Strengthens, Remains Uneven." Overall, the report suggests that the United States’ forecast for economic growth is better than it is for many advanced European economies, with others roughly comparable. In general, the United States is expected to have the highest growth in the coming year -- a projected 2.75 percent. In fact, the report found that the United States economy accelerated faster than anticipated in 2013, while many advanced economies in Europe are still struggling with high unemployment, debt and other financial issues. Canada, too, has seen some growth, but sluggish exports and business investments have kept the growth fairly slow. "The strengthening of the recovery from the Great Recession in the advanced economies is a welcome development," the report says. "But growth is not evenly robust across the globe." In many advanced Asian economies, for instance, the recovery is steady due in large part to growing exports, domestic demand and strong labor markets. (Japan, which is undergoing structural reforms, is an exception.) Australia and New Zealand -- neither of which was included in the report the White House cited -- have growth classified as "stable." Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said another factor to consider is the long-term damage caused by the recession. Ball looked at 23 countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and compared how much they thought they could grow in 2007 to how much they think they can grow now, based on OECD estimates. Ball found that, on average, these countries sustained an 8.3 percent blow to their potential output for growth. While some countries, Australia and Switzerland, took a very small hit to their potential output, Greece, Hungary and Ireland absorbed blows of roughly 30 percent compared to their GDP prospects before the recession. For the United States, the figure is 5.3 percent -- lower than the rate for most advanced countries, but higher than Australia, Switzerland and Germany. This shows that even though the United States has recovered well compared to other countries, it has still lost potential output as a result of the recession, Ball said. Our ruling Obama said the United States has "recovered faster and come farther than almost any other advanced country on Earth" since the end of the Great Recession. The White House’s supporting data is pretty narrow, but other measurements show that the United States has generally fared better since the recession than many -- though not all -- of its peers among the world’s advanced economies. On balance, we rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-07-23T15:12:58	2014-07-17	['None']
pomt-01035	The U.S. unemployment rate has "been massaged, it’s been doctored."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/jan/26/rick-perry/rick-perry-iowa-says-unemployment-rate-has-been-ma/	Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who plans to say this spring if he’ll again seek the Republican presidential nomination, questioned the validity of federal unemployment statistics as he otherwise extolled the boom in his home state, according to a reporter in attendance. In a tweet, Dave Weigel of Bloomberg Politics quoted Perry saying during a Jan. 26, 2015, breakfast event with Jewish voters in Des Moines that the official unemployment rate is unreliable: "It’s been massaged, it’s been doctored," Weigel quoted Perry saying. By phone, Weigel told us Perry made his remark while celebrating his state’s economy and did not take reporter questions. At our request, Weigel later emailed us his fuller transcript showing Perry said: "We've got the lowest participation rate since the late 1970s when Jimmy Carter was president. I'm talking about participation in the work force. That's of really great concern for me." Perry continued: "I mean, who is it standing up for these people that I call the uncounted? They've lost hope that they can even get a job, so they're not even counted. When you look at the unemployment rate today, that's not the true unemployment rate, it's been massaged, it's been doctored," Perry said. The U.S. unemployment rate was 5.6 percent in December 2014, down from as much as 10 percent in 2009, Democrat Barack Obama’s first year as president. The Texas jobless rate was 4.6 percent, the state’s lowest since May 2008. Indeed, on Jan. 15, 2015, in his last speech to Texas legislators as governor, Perry saluted the state’s job gains, also noting the Texas jobless rate was "significantly below the national average." So we were curious what he meant about the rate being doctored and asked Perry aides to elaborate--without success. Jobless rate an imperfect indicator Nationally, the persistence of discouraged workers and declining workforce participation often come up as criticisms of the jobless rate. Perry’s mention of the official jobless rate leaving out discouraged workers was accurate. After Obama’s latest State of the Union address, PolitiFact rated Mostly True the Democratic leader’s declaration the unemployment rate was the lowest it had been since before the financial crisis that blew up around the time of his 2008 election. Still, that fact check noted Obama was citing the most basic version of the unemployment rate, which draws on regular surveys of households that originated in 1940. Another version of the rate, known as U-6, tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weaknesses by accounting for people who are unemployed plus people working part-time who would rather have full-time work -- and people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. By rolling in these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate but is usually a few points higher. And as it happens, the U-6 rate -- unlike the official unemployment rate -- hasn’t returned to its pre-financial-crisis level. The national December 2014 U-6 rate was 11.2 percent, higher than the 11 percent rate in September 2008. This gets us to Perry’s mention of labor force participation, which gauges the number of people in the labor force compared to the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The labor force shrinks whenever someone retires, voluntarily gives up working (such as when they become a full-time parent or go back to school full-time) or because they simply give up on finding a job. Historically, workforce participation was down in the national recession at the end of Carter’s tenure and through the start of Ronald Reagan’s presidency, PolitiFact noted in 2012. More recently, the labor force participation rate has markedly decreased since 2008. In September 2008, it stood at 66 percent; it was nearly 63 percent as of December 2014, the most recent month of available data. So, the participation rate is lately at its lowest point since the late 1970s, which also was a time when fewer women had jobs outside the home. This decrease has partly been influenced by the aging of the workforce (as in Baby Boomer retirements). No signs of doctoring These wrinkles noted, is there evidence the jobless rate has been massaged and doctored, as Perry put it? We found none. In November 2013, after a manipulation charge bubbled up involving the Philadelphia region, the U.S. Census Bureau -- which conducts the Current Population Survey that gathers information from households later converted by the government to the unemployment rate -- posted a statement saying: "We have no reason to believe that there was a systematic manipulation of the data described in media reports. As a statistical agency, the Census Bureau is very conscientious about our responsibility to produce accurate Current Population Survey data for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and all other surveys we conduct." The bureau referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Office of the Inspector General, which said in May 2014 it had found "no evidence" unemployment data had been manipulated in the months leading up to the November 2012 national election. That report also recommended some bureau reforms. None of several experts responding to our inquiries said the unemployment rate has been massaged or doctored. Among them, Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute told us the fact the regular jobless rate doesn’t reflect discouraged job-seekers or part-timers wishing for full-time jobs isn’t a deliberate government misrepresentation. Still, Biggs emailed, it means the unemployment rate doesn’t deliver an accurate picture of the labor market’s health. "If labor force participation were the same today as prior to the recession, I believe the unemployment rate would be around 8.3%. So the idea that the labor market is really healthy today just isn’t that true," he said. In 2013, economists told PolitiFact it would be extremely difficult to alter the unemployment rate. William Shobe, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Studies at the University of Virginia, said it’s important to remember there are many measures of unemployment, including privately produced surveys. "And they all agree, within the margins of error," Shobe said. "The immediate conclusion that you can draw from that is that no rogue interviewer or group of rogue interviewers have managed to budge the unemployment far (or at all, mind you) from the value it would have had otherwise." Shobe added that any effort to fudge the national numbers would require the participation of interviewers across the country. "Otherwise you would see only a localized move which would wash out as noise in the national stats," he said. Shobe, reached afresh for this story, said he was unaware of developments that would support the former governor’s claim. "The whole idea that you could get a group of these statisticians to lie about these survey results they’re collecting and have that stick, that’s just crazy," Shobe said."These are career civil servants. Their incentives are to get the best possible numbers." Shobe suggested we query University of Wisconsin economist Menzie Chinn who told us by email that he considers such critiques of the rate to be "specious;" Chinn pointed us to his October 2012 blog post taking to task a similar statement by business executive Jack Welch. Asked to assess Perry’s comment in full, Chinn said: "It’s true that had the labor force participation rate not declined, and we used the number of employed actually observed to calculate a rate, then mechanically the unemployment rate would have to be higher." Regardless, he said, it’s not so that government statisticians changed the procedure for calculations in order to change the reported unemployment number – which Chinn said is how he would define "doctored." By phone, Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, said nothing notable has occurred to demonstrate the unemployment rate has been doctored or massaged, though in August 2014, Princeton University economist Alan Krueger and others wrote a paper pointing out fewer people are responding to the survey that feeds the rate. A New York Times columnist, David Leonhardt, summarized the upshot as being a seeming "increase in the number of people who once would have qualified as officially unemployed and today are considered out of the labor force, neither working nor looking for work." Sinclair speculated by email that Perry’s reference to discouraged workers being left out of the rate means he’d prefer to see the rate calculated with the workers counted. But the words "massaged" and "doctored," Sinclair said, each carries a charge, implying the rate is nefariously manipulated. "We have no evidence of that," Sinclair said. Our ruling Addressing Iowans, Perry said the official U.S. jobless rate "has been doctored, it’s been massaged." There’s legitimate debate about what statistic best measures the state of the workforce and even agreement that the widely quoted unemployment rate (which Perry stressed as meaningful about a week before this Iowa stop) doesn’t provide the fullest picture of the labor force. But that's a far cry from showing the government is massaging or doctoring numbers, which implies organized underhanded wrongdoing. Perry may yet elaborate.

pomt-01694	Says he "voted for even stronger protections (in the Violence Against Women Act) than Obama's agenda will allow."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/13/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-he-supported-stronger-violenc/	Sen. Mitch McConnell enlisted the help of his wife, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, to push back against claims from Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes that the Kentucky Republican is anti-women. "Have you ever noticed how some liberals feel entitled to speak on behalf of all women? As if every woman agrees with Barack Obama," Chao says in an ad released Aug. 5, 2014. A narrator adds: "Mitch McConnell co-sponsored the original Violence Against Women Act – he’s always supported its purpose. Mitch voted for even stronger protections than Obama’s agenda will allow." We took a look at Grimes’ ad in a separate fact-check. We said the claim that McConnell voted "two times against the Violence against Women Act" was Half True, given McConnell’s history of voting in favor of the law at times. But what about McConnell’s response that he "voted for even stronger protections" than the Violence Against Women Act that President Barack Obama signed? The Violence Against Women Act first passed Congress in 1994 and, according to the Congressional Research Service, was "intended to change attitudes toward domestic violence, foster awareness of domestic violence, improve services and provisions for victims, and revise the manner in which the criminal justice system responds to domestic violence." The bill was reauthorized and expanded several times in the succeeding two decades, most recently in 2013. While the Violence Against Women Act sailed to reauthorization in 2000 and 2005, attempts to do so in 2012 and 2013 were marred by partisan fighting in Congress. Democrats presented a bill with three new components that many Republicans rejected: including victims of discrimination for sexual orientation and gender identity among "underserved populations"; increasing the cap on U-Visas, a visa that grants nonimmigrant status to immigrant victims of domestic violence who assist police in prosecuting their attackers; allowing non-American Indian residents on tribal land to be prosecuted by tribal courts for domestic violence. The 2012 Senate bill died in the House, but the 2013 version passed Congress and was signed by Obama. Both years, Republicans offered their own versions of the Violence Against Women Act. Those measures, McConnell’s campaign said, included provisions that made them "stronger" than the bill Obama signed into law. What were those provisions? For starters, Republicans proposed mandatory minimum sentences — ranging from 5 to 15 years — on certain sexual assault crimes. However, advocates of domestic violence awareness were specifically against the inclusion of these provisions. The National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women, an umbrella group for many stakeholders advocating on this issue, worried that long mandatory minimums would "keep victims who were assaulted by someone they know from reporting" and would create other issues in sentencing. "These proposals are solutions in search of problems, and will only serve to exacerbate the already existing problem of prison overcrowding," the organization wrote. McConnell’s campaign also noted that the Republican amendments required that 30 percent of the grant money given to states and localities to train and assist law enforcement in combating violence against women must be set aside for sexual assault. The Democratic bill put the figure at 20 percent. But this was more a shift in priorities than anything. It wasn’t allocating extra money to combat violence against women, just mandating how much of the pot must be spent on a specific type of violence. Advocates of the Democratic bill said the Republican bill was weaker because it did not include the additional protections for LGBT, immigrants and American Indian women who are abused on tribal land by non-natives. While there were may have been considerable political differences on whether those provisions should be part of the Violence Against Women Act, it’s hard to claim that bills that didn’t include them — the ones McConnell supported — had "stronger protections." Our ruling McConnell’s ad claimed that he "voted for even stronger protections than Obama’s agenda will allow." Perhaps McConnell could argue that the mandatory minimum sentences Republicans required in their alternative made for a "stronger" bill, but advocates of domestic abuse awareness opposed this measure as unnecessary. And the Republican measure was absent several protections for certain groups that were included in the bill Obama signed. McConnell is within his right to oppose those provisions, but it makes it hard for him to prove that he supported "stronger" legislation. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-03104	"Terry McAuliffe cashed in, walking away with millions" from the demise of Global Crossing.	false	/virginia/statements/2013/sep/23/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinell-ad-says-mcauliffe-cashed-demise-global-c/	Republican Ken Cuccinelli claims in a TV ad that Democrat Terry McAuliffe walked away with millions of dollars from a company that went bankrupt and left thousands without jobs and retirement savings. The 30-second spot focuses on McAuliffe’s relationship with Global Crossings, a start-up fiber-optic company whose stock soared in the late 1990s and crashed in 2002. The commercial starts with footage of a fenced-in, abandoned plant, and shifts to interviews with former employees. Here’s the script: Narrator: "January 2002. New York firm Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy." Corey Darrow, former worker: "I lost all my severance. Lost all the money in my 401k." Deb Goehring, former worker: "Got locked out. And that was it. My career was over." Narrator: "Yet political insider and investor Terry McAuliffe cashed in, walking away with millions." Gary Baron, former worker: "Probably had some insider knowledge. There’s a lot of lies to make money for themselves." Darrow: "You know, it’s like they took my money and ran." Narrator: "That’s the real Terry McAuliffe." We took a look at whether McAuliffe really did enrich himself on the company’s demise. The ad has been controversial since its release on Sept. 6. Two of the former employees in the ad told Mother Jones magazine they thought they were being interviewed for a documentary and did not know their words would be used in a political commercial. Cuccinelli’s campaign says the former employees knew how their comments would be used and sent us a long list of articles detailing Global Crossing’s rise and fall and McAuliffe’s ties to the firm. The relationship began in 1997, a year after McAuliffe helped President Bill Clinton get reelected by serving as his chief fundraiser. McAuliffe was retained as a dealmaker by Gary Winnick, a Los Angeles billionaire investor who was starting Global Crossing Holdings, a telecommunications company that would own and operate undersea fiber-optic cables. McAuliffe invested $100,000 of his own money in Global Crossing stock before it was publicly offered. McAuliffe, in a 1999 story in The New York Times, said Winnick "wanted a stable of people around him with great contacts" to "help him work on details." McAuliffe said in the article that "Winnick was looking for a little political action." McAuliffe’s retainer with Winnick ended in 1998. But he was allowed to hold on the stock, which rocketed in the dot.com boom. Cuccinelli’s ad contains a picture of McAuliffe smiling and the printed words, "Made a profit of $18 million." That comes from the 1999 Times article in which McAuliffe said the value of his $100,000 investment in Global Crossing had risen to about $18 million. But that’s not the amount McAuliffe pocketed. McAuliffe said during his unsuccessful 2009 gubernatorial campaign that he ended up making $8 million, a figure that was confirmed that year by Associated Press, which was given access to McAuliffe’s trading records. "His return was $8.1 million, mostly on the sale of 176,017 shares in 1999, the year Global Crossing stock peaked beyond $60 a share," the AP reported. "He could have made much more -- closer to the $18 million in some published reports -- had he sold all of his shares in 1999," the AP wrote. "Stock transaction records he provided to the AP show his last shares were sold in January 2002, after the company’s stock had plunged to 14 cents a share. And, as McAuliffe notes, he was never a board member or officer of the company." The first sign of Global’s demise, according to The Times, came in April 2001 when officers were told revenues were going to fall $1 billion short of earning estimates. That was about two years after McAuliffe made his stock killing. Cuccinelli’s ad, without directly saying so, links McAuliffe’s profit to the downfall of Global Crossing, which caused about 12,000 workers to lose their jobs and retirement funds. The company froze their pensions and invested their 401 (k) retirement savings in Global Crossing stock, which became worthless. But none of the three former employees in the ad mentions McAuliffe by name. Two of the workers placed the blame on an unidentified "they" and "them." And the third employee, Deb Goehring, has told Mother Jones magazine and The Virginian-Pilot that she bears no animus towards McAuliffe. "I said I don't really know anything about Terry McAuliffe," she told Mother Jones. "He was not involved in day-to-day operations in any way that I saw. As far as I'm concerned, he was like me, a stockholder, and he was able to make money at it. More power to the man. Good for him." McAuliffe’s campaign, in responding to the ad, has stressed that McAuliffe "had no role in running the company" and that his Global Crossing holdings were a tiny fraction of the $20 billion value of the company’s in stock estimated by Forbes Magazine in April 1999. Chris LaCivita, Cuccinelli’s chief strategist, says the ad shows "Winnick provided an insider deal that proved very lucrative for McAuliffe, despite thousands losing their jobs. McAuliffe has spent his entire career connecting wealthy donors to elected officials and leveraging those contacts to make a fortune for himself, while workers get left out in the cold." Our ruling McAuliffe made a fantastic profit through an insider deal that allowed him to buy Global Crossing stock before it was offered to the public. Cuccinelli’s ad, without directly saying so, clearly links McAuliffe’s gain to the downfall of the company and the woes of its employees. There’s no evidence McAuliffe had a management role in Global Crossing. He was an investor who bought low and sold about half of his holdings at peak value. He held on to the rest of his shares until they were virtually worthless. All of the shares were publicly traded, so it’s far-fetched to suggest McAuliffe raided the company’s coffers. We rate the claim False.	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2013-09-23T05:00:00	2013-09-06	['None']
pomt-00980	Hispanic students in Florida perform "the best" of any Hispanic population in the United States.	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/feb/11/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-florida-hispanic-students-perform-be/	A key part of former Gov. Jeb Bush’s talking points as he explores a presidential bid is to call for giving every child access to a great public education, regardless of where they live. Bush has talked for years about the gains of minority students in Florida. "Florida’s Hispanic kids are the best of any Hispanic group of Hispanic students in the United States -- in fact, two grade levels ahead of the average in the United States," Bush said during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club on Feb. 4 We decided to fact-check if Hispanic students in Florida perform "the best" of any Hispanic population in the United States. Let’s hit the books. Florida’s Hispanic students A spokeswoman for Bush told PolitiFact that Bush was referring to fourth grade reading scores from The National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP. Many educational experts consider the annual NAEP, dubbed "the nation’s report card," to be the best state-by-state measure of education systems. Sponsored by the U.S. Education Department, the exam is given to a sample of fourth, eighth and 12th grade students every two years in reading and math. For 2013, the NAEP showed that Florida’s Hispanic fourth-graders ranked the first state in the nation for highest average reading score. (The Education Department considers Florida’s score statistically tied with a handful of other states.) So Bush chose a statistic that puts Florida’s Hispanic students in the most favorable light. While Bush can point to the NAEP reading results for fourth graders and argue Florida’s students are "the best," that title doesn’t hold up on all NAEP measurements. For example, Florida’s Hispanic fourth graders were fourth among states for math, and eighth graders ranked lower in both reading and math. Is there a valid reason for Bush to zero in on fourth-grade reading? "Reading scores in fourth grade are widely considered to be an important metric because early literacy has been linked to subsequent educational outcomes," said Sterling C. Lloyd, senior research associate at Education Week Research Center. "For instance, according to research studies, students who are struggling to read in third grade are at greater risk of dropping out of high school. It’s thought of as an early warning sign predicting risk of dropping out." But it’s helpful to consider NAEP scores in other grades and subjects, as well as high school graduation rates, to "provide a more comprehensive view of educational results than a single metric," Lloyd said. For example, with respect to eighth grade NAEP reading, Florida’s scores for Hispanic students were 12th nationally (out of 46 states and D.C.). For eighth grade math, Florida ranked 20th. Another expert took issue with the definition of "Hispanic." Richard Rothstein, an education research associate at the Economic Policy Institute, previously told us that it’s a meaningless category for educational purposes. "Florida’s ‘Hispanics’ are not comparable to ‘Hispanics’ in other states because Florida’s include a larger proportion of middle-class Cubans, and a smaller proportion of lower-class Mexicans. Without knowing anything else, you would expect middle-class Cubans to perform at a higher level than lower-class Mexicans, because of the literacy levels at home, if for no other reason." University of Iowa Professor David Bills said we would need to know more about the family background of Hispanics in different states to reach any conclusions about why Florida outperforms other states. "If there is anything we know for certain about test scores, it’s that the effects of families trump the effects of schools," he said. "My guess is that they’re more likely to have well-educated parents than are Hispanic kids from California or Wisconsin, which score much lower. I think in a properly conducted study, we would learn that Florida’s fourth grade Hispanics do pretty well more because they come from social backgrounds that facilitate their doing well, and less because of things happening inside schools." Our ruling Bush said, "Florida’s Hispanic kids are the best of any Hispanic group of Hispanics students in the United States." Bush’s statement was too broad and he didn’t explain what measurement he used to reach that conclusion -- which was fourth grade reading scores. On NAEP, a respected source of testing data, Florida’s Hispanic fourth graders ranked statistically tied for first among states in 2013. But that's not the case for fourth grade math. Nor does the trend continue when looking at eighth grade test scores. Bush's claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-10431	"They (Clinton and Obama) have never to my knowledge been involved in legislation nor hearings nor engagement on this issue (climate change)."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/14/john-mccain/they-have-yours-in-fact/	On a so-called "Green Tour" of the Northwest touting his environmental record, Sen. John McCain was asked during a press conference in North Bend, Wash., on May 13, 2008, why voters concerned about climate change should back him over his Democratic rivals, Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. "I've been involved in this issue for many, many years," McCain said. "They have never, to my knowledge, been involved in legislation nor hearings nor engagement on this issue. I have a long history. I've traveled around the world and seen the impacts of climate change.'" Perhaps McCain should check the co-sponsors of emissions-reducing legislation he introduced with Sen. Joseph Lieberman last year. Both Clinton and Obama were among those who signed on to the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act. McCain's cap-and-trade initiative includes a market-driven plan in which companies that significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions can sell emission allowances to other companies struggling to meet required standards. The plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent from 2000 levels by 2050. Last year, Clinton and Obama co-sponsored an even more ambitious plan called the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act. If passed, it would require an 80 percent reduction to 2000 levels over the same time frame. Clinton, who sits on the Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works, has consistently supported legislation to combat global warming since joining the Senate in 2000. In April 2008, Clinton was one of four U.S. senators who wrote a letter to the chair and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies requesting $70-million for the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) and $270.3-million for state and local air quality grants. Obama also has been active in climate change issues, and the Obama campaign quickly seized on McCain's statement. The campaign noted that Obama was the chief sponsor in 2007 of a bill to establish a Climate Change Education Program; that in 2007 he sponsored the Health Care for Hybrids Act, which offered government-subsidized health care to automakers in exchange for investing in alternative energy/efficiency technology; that in 2005, he sponsored an amendment to fund research to improve high-mileage plug-in hybrid cars; and that in 2007, he sponsored the Fuel Economy Reform Act, which would require an average fuel economy standard of 27.5 miles per gallon for all automobiles manufactured by 2013, and increasingly better gas mileage in subsequent years. It's also curious that McCain mentioned his travels to see the impacts of climate change firsthand. In August 2004, Clinton was on the same trip as McCain to the fjords of Svalbard, a remote Norwegian island in the Arctic Ocean, where they took a mini-cruise to view the retreat of melted glaciers. (An article on the official Norway Web site in the United States features a photo of the heavily bundled McCain and Clinton standing next to each other). The following year, in August 2005, Clinton was again in the legislative contingent when McCain traveled to Alaska to view melting permafrost and shrinking glaciers. McCain's campaign did not respond to PolitiFact, but McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds told the Washington Post that opponents were splitting hairs over McCain's comments. "Of the candidates who are running for president, there is no one who has demonstrated more leadership on the issue of global climate change than John McCain," Bounds said. "I believe he was making that point." There's no question McCain has been a leader on addressing global warming, particularly among his Republican counterparts. But in trying to make that point, McCain grossly misrepresented his opponents' record. We rate his statement False.

pomt-07867	The majority of people in polls do "not support Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/08/bill-oreilly/majority-people-polls-do-not-support-obamacare/	Correction: Due to a math error, this story originally said that a Kaiser poll showed that 49 percent of respondents wanted the health care law kept or expanded. The correct figure is 47 percent. In an interview on Sunday with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, President Barack Obama defended the health care law as a common-sense measure aimed at protecting average Americans. There's no reason people should go bankrupt if they happen to get sick, Obama said. "The notion that that's a radical principle, I don't think the majority of people would agree with you," he added. "Then why do the majority people in the polls not support Obamacare?" O'Reilly asked. Obama: "Actually, I think it's pretty evenly divided." "It's close," O'Reilly said, adding that "other people see it as a huge government intrusion, and you guys just want to take over, basically, decision-making for Americans. It's an ideological argument." Here, we wanted to referee the dispute on the poll numbers: Do a majority of people in the polls oppose the health care law? Since O'Reilly brought it up, we decided to check his statement. There are many, many polls to choose from when it comes to public opinion on health care. Pollsters have been asking people their thoughts on the plan for the past two years, long before it passed in March 2010. The best evidence for O'Reilly's position was the most recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard School Of Public Health. In its most recent tracking poll, it found that 50 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of the law, while 41 percent viewed it favorably. But another 9 percent said they didn't know or didn't want to answer. Certainly, the largest category in this poll didn't like health care, but if you combined supporters with the unknowns, you do get an even split. When you average polls over the past few months, the result is that the public is evenly split on the health care bill, said Dr. Robert Blendon, a professor at Harvard who was one of the poll's designers. Opinions on it also tend to break down along partisan lines. "Republicans continue to overwhelmingly dislike this bill, and Democrats favor it and would like to see it expanded in one way or another. Independents are split and tend to move one way or another," Blendon said. Things get even trickier when you ask people about repealing the law, because a significant portion of those who say they view the law unfavorably also say they they are opposed to a complete repeal. The most recent Kaiser poll showed that 19 percent said keep the law as it is; 28 percent said expand the law; 23 percent said repeal the law and replace it with a Republican alternative; 20 percent said repeal it and don't replace it. That means 47 percent want the law kept or expanded, and 43 percent want it replaced with a Republican alternative or simply repealed. Some polls have also found that at least a portion of people who dislike the health care bill dislike it because they wanted to see more dramatic changes to the health care system. A CNN poll in December found that 13 percent of those who opposed the law did so because it wasn't liberal enough. Another 43 percent favored the bill and 37 percent said it was too liberal. There's also some evidence of small shifts in opinion depending on how the question is asked. When the polls are as close as they are on health care, that can make a difference in which side prevails. Finally, individual components of health care tend to poll very well, such as tax credits to help low- and moderate-income people buy insurance (79 percent favorable) and expanding Medicaid, the government-run health care program for the poor (67 percent favorable). The least popular part of the law is the individual mandate requiring people to buy insurance (23 percent favorable). O'Reilly said that a "majority of the people in the polls" do not support the health care law. If we were rating Obama's statement on its own, that the public is evenly divided, we would rate that True. But O'Reilly isn't entirely wrong, in the sense that support for the bill does not hit 50 percent or higher. Taking a broad picture of the polls reveals a divided public, so we rate his statement Half True.	None	Bill O'Reilly	None	None	None	2011-02-08T14:19:55	2011-02-06	['None']

pomt-04671	Says Romney called Russia our No. 1 enemy.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-called-russia-our-no-1-enemy/	President Barack Obama reminded Americans in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention that he’s also the nation’s commander-in-chief who has made tough decisions in wartime and negotiated delicate diplomatic situations. His opponent, Obama said, is "new to foreign policy" and will drag the country back into old conflicts. "After all, you don't call Russia our No. 1 enemy -- not Al-Qaida, Russia -- unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp," Obama said, alluding to Republican rival Mitt Romney. We wondered if Romney really did say that Russia is public enemy No. 1. The hot mic In March 2012, at a summit in South Korea, Obama was caught in a "hot mic" incident. Without realizing he could be overheard, Obama told Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more ability to negotiate with the Russians about missile defense after the November election. "On all these issues, but particularly missile defense, this, this can be solved, but it’s important for him to give me space," Obama was heard telling Medvedev, apparently referring to incoming Russian president Vladi­mir Putin. "Yeah, I understand," Medvedev replied. Obama then interjected, saying, "This is my last election. After my election, I have more flexibility." The exchange drew swift rebuke from Republicans, who accused Obama of caving on an important security issue. GOP lawmakers favor a strong missile defense system that protects the continental U.S., while Russia opposes the U.S. enhancing its defense systems in Europe. Romney quickly joined the chorus of critics. In a March 26 interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN, he criticized Obama for changing tactics on missile defense and nuclear weapons development, and said the president seemed to be willing to negotiate with Russians on matters he was hiding from the American people. Said Romney: "This is without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe. They fight for every cause for the world's worst actors. The idea that he has more flexibility in mind for Russia is very, very troubling indeed." Blitzer asked Romney if he thought Russia is a bigger foe than Iran, China or North Korea. "I'm saying in terms of a geopolitical opponent, the nation that lines up with the world's worst actors," Romney said. "Of course the greatest threat that the world faces is a nuclear Iran, and a nuclear North Korea is already troubling enough. But when these terrible actors pursue their course in the world and we go to the United Nations looking for ways to stop them ... who is it that always stands up with the world's worst actors? It's always Russia, typically with China alongside. And so in terms of a geopolitical foe, a nation that's on the Security Council that has the heft of the Security Council, and is of course is a massive nuclear power, Russia is the geopolitical foe." The op-ed Romney followed that interview a day later with an op-ed in Foreign Policy magazine. In that piece, he never used the word "enemy" or "foe" to describe Russia. But he did depict it as an adversary and referred to its "intransigence." "Without extracting meaningful concessions from Russia, (Obama) abandoned our missile defense sites in Poland. He granted Russia new limits on our nuclear arsenal. He capitulated to Russia's demand that a United Nations resolution on the Iranian nuclear-weapons program exclude crippling sanctions," Romney wrote. "Moscow has rewarded these gifts with nothing but obstructionism at the United Nations on a whole raft of issues. It has continued to arm the regime of Syria's vicious dictator and blocked multilateral efforts to stop the ongoing carnage there. Across the board, it has been a thorn in our side on questions vital to America's national security. For three years, the sum total of President Obama's policy toward Russia has been: ‘We give, Russia gets.’" Later, on a multi-nation trip in July designed to beef up his foreign policy credentials, Romney condemned Russia as a "country where the desire to be free is met with brutal oppression." The later interview Romney spoke again to CNN’s Blitzer in July. Romney’s campaign pointed us to this exchange: Blitzer: "The last time you and I spoke in an interview, you told me that Russia was America’s No. 1 geostrategic foe. Do you still believe that?" Romney: "There's no question but that in terms of geopolitics -- I’m talking about votes at the United Nations and actions of a geopolitical nature -- Russia is the No. 1 adversary in that regard. That doesn't make them an enemy. It doesn’t make them a combatant. They don't represent the No. 1 national security threat. The No. 1 national security threat, of course, to our nation is a nuclear Iran. Time continues to pass. They continue to move towards nuclearization. This is more and more disconcerting and dangerous to the world. But Russia -- particularly look at a place like Syria. Russia has supported the Assad regime even as it has been attacking its own people. Russia likewise has been slow to move to the kinds of sanctions that have been called for in Iran. Russia is a geopolitical adversary, but it's not an enemy with, you know, missiles being fired at one another or things of that nature." Our ruling In his convention speech, Obama claimed threat Romney called Russia "our No. 1 enemy." Romney didn’t use those exact words, but he did refer to Russia as "without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe." He said the Russians "fight for every cause for the world's worst actors" in a CNN interview. In a later interview, however, Romney softened his language, this time calling Russia our "No. 1 adversary" in terms of UN votes and emphasized it’s not an enemy of the kind launching missiles at American shores. That’s an important clarification, but it’s worth noting that five months passed before Romney walked back his earlier remarks. Obama’s statement lacked that context but was still largely accurate about Romney’s original description of Russia. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-06538	"The typical white male worker in this country is making in real terms what he was making in 1973" and "the average worker is making what they were making in 1996."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/05/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-typical-white-male-worker-earns/	As the 2012 elections loom and President Barack Obama pushes for his jobs plan, a key issue is how middle-class families have fared over the past generation. Obama and other Democrats would like to see the Bush-era tax cuts expire for couples making more than $250,000 and also raise taxes on hedge-fund millionaires paying relatively low capital gains tax rates. For their part, Republicans claim Obama is engaging in "class warfare" against job creators. In a Sept. 27, 2011 speech at St. Anselm College’s New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester, David Axelrod, one of Obama’s top strategists, said there has been a "hollowing out of the middle class in this country" in recent decades as "wages have essentially flat-lined" for many workers. "There was a census report just a couple of weeks ago, and what it said was that the average white male worker, the typical white male worker in this country, is making in real terms what he was making in 1973," said Axelrod, a former White House aide and now a senior adviser to Obama’s political campaign. "In total, the average worker is making what they were making in 1996, but we know prices haven’t gone along accordingly." If true, that’s quite a ride back in time. Asked for substantiation, Katie Hogan of the Obama campaign referred us to a U.S. Census report released last month, and articles in the New York Times and the New Yorker website crunching some of the numbers. The report itself didn’t have the precise numbers to back up Axelrod’s first claim -- that the typical white male worker made the same amount -- adjusted for inflation -- in 1973, when Richard Nixon occupied the White House. But a related census spreadsheet shows that real wages have not only failed to grow but have actually declined slightly for white males working year-round and full time. But first, a semantic point near and dear to the heart of economists. Even though Axelrod said "average" in his statement, it’s clear by his subsequent use of the word "typical" and the reports to which we were referred that median income, not the mean, is what applies here. In 2010, according to census data, the median earnings for a full-time white male worker were $50,074. By comparison, in 1973, the median for that category, in 2010 dollars, was $50,513. So Axelrod not only was correct that white men were no better off, adjusted for inflation, in 2010 than they were 37 years ago, they were taking home about $8.44 less per week. And when measured by the purchasing power of those dollars, the gap is even bigger. Because wages haven’t kept up with prices, as Axelrod asserted, the typical white male worker's purchasing power has eroded by almost 11.5 percent in 37 years. Heidi Shierholz, a labor market economist for the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank in Washington, said Axelrod’s statement about white male workers is "unambiguously true," and that wages haven’t kept up with major gains in productivity. "The growing wealth of the country actually didn’t translate into higher standards of living or wages for typical workers," she said. "Where it [the wealth] went was to the top." In the second part of Axelrod’s statement -- that "the average worker is making what they were making in 1996" -- it appears that the Obama strategist got some numbers mixed up. A census table shows that median earnings for all full-time workers who clocked at least 50 weeks of labor increased by about 7 percent in real terms between 1996 and 2010, to $41,919. This came as earnings by women, and their participation in the labor force, grew at a faster rate than that of men, though the female-to-male earnings ratio was still 77.4 cents to the dollar in 2010. Given the report Hogan, the Obama campaign press aide, cited, however, along with a number widely reported in the press last month, what Axelrod apparently was referring to when he spoke of average workers making what they did in 1996 were census numbers that showed total household income, adjusted for inflation, has barely increased. Median household income in 2010 was $49,445, only a $333 increase, or 0.7 percent, in inflation-adjusted dollars from 1996. Some important factors are at play in household income numbers. For starters, households are smaller now, meaning there are fewer wage-earners to be counted. But women’s participation in the labor market has also increased. What that means, essentially, is that wage-earners in middle-class American households are working more to maintain the same level of income. "One of the ways families made up the difference was more work," Shierholz said of the stagnant wage issue. "It’s largely an hours story." A paper Shierholz co-authored after the new census numbers were released also showed that median income for working-age households fell by more than 10 percent in the past decade, to $55,276. Given such factors, she said the second half of Axelrod’s statement "captures the flavor" of what the EPI and others have labeled a "lost decade" in terms of income. Our ruling Axelrod was on the money in talking about the erosion of earnings for white male workers since the early 1970s, and basically on track in comparing how things stand today for the typical American family compared to 1996. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	David Axelrod	None	None	None	2011-10-05T16:30:48	2011-09-27	['None']
pomt-15098	"A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-most-gop-candidates-publicly-embraced-amn/	On one of the biggest issues in the 2016 Republican primary -- immigration -- Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was nothing if not consistent during the second GOP presidential debate. Cruz, angling to be the primary field’s most hard-line candidate against illegal immigration, said at the CNN Reagan Library debate, "A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty." That was similar to something he said at the first debate, held in Cleveland and aired by Fox News in August -- that "a majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty." We checked that claim and gave it a rating of Mostly True. The stages were similar for the two debates, with the addition of former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina in the second debate. Does Cruz’s claim hold up? As we noted in our previous fact-check, the tough part of checking this claim is that "amnesty" is a vague term. Some consider amnesty to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements. Cruz has been adamantly opposed to a pathway to citizenship, but he’s been quiet on whether he would support some other legal status for illegal immigrants. We’ve previously found that in modern politics, the standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, supported and signed by President Ronald Reagan. The law allowed illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents if they met certain standards, such as proving they had been in the country for several years and paying back taxes and a fine. After meeting other requirements, the legal permanent residents could apply for a green card and eventually make their way toward citizenship. The law was widely described as an amnesty program. We do know Cruz considered the 2013 bipartisan Senate immigration proposal to be a form of amnesty and opposed the bill. The failed bill was similar to the Reagan law in that immigrants had to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status that put them on a path to citizenship, though the requirements are more stringent than the previous law. So we’ve used that bill as a rough standard for evaluating the positions of those who shared the debate stage with Cruz. We’ll also note that since Cruz used the past tense -- "previously and publicly embraced amnesty" -- we’re only interested in whether the candidates have taken this position in the past, not whether they do now, or whether they have gone back and forth on the policy. Three members of the debate field have expressed outright support for the Gang of Eight bill, so called after the bipartisan group of eight senators who proposed it in 2013. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., by Cruz’s standards, has been a clear supporter of amnesty, as he was a member of the Gang of Eight. At the time, he said the bill was "not amnesty," and we rated that claim Half True because of the vague nature of the term "amnesty." Since then, Rubio has softened his support for a path to citizenship and emphasized border security, but he still supports passing immigration legislation. Fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, the former governor, said in March 2015 that he would put his support behind a Gang of Eight-style immigration bill that included a path to citizenship. Like Rubio, though, Bush insisted at the debate that his position is not amnesty, because his ideal plan requires illegal immigrants to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status. Recently, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has avoided saying whether he would support a path to citizenship, though he has suggested he would not blanket deport all illegal immigrants. But in 2013, asked by Fox if he would side with Cruz or the Gang of Eight, Huckabee said he would choose the latter -- though he emphasized an eventual immigration bill had to emphasize border security. He has also previously endorsed a path to citizenship. Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., did not support the Gang of Eight bill because he said it did not include strong enough provisions for ensuring reduced illegal immigration in the future. But in a March 2015 speech, Paul walked a fine line, supporting a path to some sort of normative legal status, though without using the word "citizenship." For the remaining candidates, we could not find their opinions on the Gang of Eight bill specifically, but all four have at some point said they supported a path either to citizenship or legal status, even if their position has since changed. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker no longer supports a path to citizenship, but he said in 2013 that "it makes sense" people could not only stay in the United States but get citizenship after overcoming penalties, waiting periods and other requirements. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson has declined to comment on the Gang of Eight bill. He has said that the solution for illegal immigrants currently in the United States is for them to go back to their home country, where they can apply for a visa and return legally. In Carson’s 2012 book, America the Beautiful, he said a path to citizenship is a moral choice. In 2010, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he supported a "common-sense path to citizenship." But this year, he said he’s changed his mind and no longer supports such a path. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said in 2014 and 2015 that he isn’t keen on a path to citizenship, but he’s open to the possibility -- especially because you can’t deport everyone who is already here, and it would help get lawmakers to a point of compromise on immigration legislation. Despite his fiery rhetoric regarding Mexican immigrants, real estate mogul Donald Trump hasn’t said many specifics about what he’d do regarding the illegal immigrants already here. He has said this year that he would support a "merit-based" system for some illegal immigrants earning their right to stay, echoing comments he made in 2011. Finally, the newcomer to the main debate stage -- Fiorina -- has also stated publicly that she is open to a path to legal status for at least some undocumented immigrants. In a June 2015 appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, she said, "I think legal status is a possibility for sure. I think their children maybe can become citizens." Our ruling Cruz said at the second Republican debate, "A majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty. I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty." We’ll reiterate that many of these candidates have changed their position on what to do about undocumented immigrants already in the United States, and we’ll note once again that the definition of "amnesty" isn’t hard and fast. So what Cruz may consider amnesty might not be what any of these candidates considers to be amnesty. Still, as far as we can tell, Cruz is the only one on the CNN debate stage who has never plainly supported something like a path to citizenship or some other form of legal status. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2015-09-16T22:42:55	2015-09-16	['None']
pomt-02586	"Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-us-has-cut-carbon-po/	In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama boasted about progress on climate change, citing reductions in carbon emissions. "Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet," he said. "Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. But we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods." We wondered whether Obama was correct that "over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth." We turned to data from the Energy Information Administration, a trusted source for all types of energy data run by the U.S. Energy Department. The agency has a table showing "total carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of energy." The data shows a mixed picture. Obama is correct if you measure the total reduction in carbon emissions. Between 2003 and 2011 -- the latest eight-year period for which data is available -- the United States’ carbon emissions fell from 5.853 billion metric tons to 5.490 billion metric tons. That’s a reduction of 363 million metric tons -- far larger than any other country. However, the statistic is not as enlightening as it would seem, because it fails to account for the relative size of countries. A more useful comparison is to measure the percentage reduction for countries all around the world. We looked at the largest nations -- those with at least 100 million tons of carbon emissions in 2011 -- and found six other nations that managed to cut their carbon emissions more steeply than the United States did during the past eight years. They are: Greece: -15 percent Germany: -14 percent United Kingdom: - 13 percent Belgium: -13 percent France: -8 percent Spain: -8 percent United States: -6 percent To be fair, many nations increased their emissions over that period -- including such big economies as China, India and Russia -- and in this context, the scale of the United States’ cuts is impressive. Still, this suggests that a half-dozen advanced industrialized economies made emissions cuts that were larger, proportionately, than the United States achieved. Our ruling Obama said, "Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth." Looked at by the total amount of emission reductions, Obama is right. But when you look at the scale of the cuts proportionately -- which puts nations on a more equal footing when making comparisons -- the United States did not achieve the kind of steep cuts that other industrialized countries did.

pomt-11798	"BUSTED: NASA Accidentally destroys every climate change advocate by exposing massive truth behind Antarctica."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/20/americannewscom/no-nasa-antarctica-study-didnt-discredit-climate-c/	The public has been misled by climate change advocates about the real reason behind the melting of Antarctica’s western ice sheet, claims the website American News. "BUSTED: NASA Accidentally destroys every climate change advocate by exposing massive truth behind Antarctica," states a Nov. 8 headline. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially misleading, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We emailed American News but did not get a reply. The American News story refers to a real study by NASA, but the headline falsely suggests that the study debunks climate change advocates. A NASA scientist involved in the study told us the headline is inaccurate. Here’s the real story: On Nov. 7, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., issued a summary of the study about the heat source under West Antarctica. The paper, "Influence of a West Antarctic mantle plume on ice sheet basal conditions," was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth. According to the NASA press release, the study "adds evidence that a geothermal heat source called a mantle plume lies deep below Antarctic Marie Byrd Land, explaining some of the melting that creates lakes and rivers under the ice sheet." The heat source isn’t new or increasing, but may help explain why the ice sheet collapsed so rapidly in an earlier area of climate change and remains unstable. Some 30 years ago, a scientist at the University of Colorado Denver suggested that heat from a mantle plume under Marie Byrd Land might explain regional volcanic activity and a topographic dome feature, NASA wrote. Recent seismic imaging has supported this concept. The American News story used an actual quote from the NASA press release by the first author of the study, Hélène Seroussi. When she first heard the idea, she said, "I thought it was crazy. I didn't see how we could have that amount of heat and still have ice on top of it." To study the concept, NASA scientists used a numerical depiction of the physics of ice sheets to capture natural sources of heating and heat transport from freezing, melting and liquid water; friction; and other processes. Mantle plumes are thought to be narrow streams of hot rock rising through Earth's mantle and spreading out like a mushroom cap under the crust, NASA wrote. The Marie Byrd Land mantle plume formed 50 million to 110 million years ago, long before the West Antarctic ice sheet came into existence, NASA wrote. "At the end of the last ice age around 11,000 years ago, the ice sheet went through a period of rapid, sustained ice loss when changes in global weather patterns and rising sea levels pushed warm water closer to the ice sheet -- just as is happening today," NASA said. Erik Ivins, a scientist and the second author on the study, told PolitiFact that the study didn’t address climate change. "The study itself is about steady state conditions that would exist at the bottom of the ice sheet for many many millions of years," he said. "We think of climate change as occurring 10 years, 100 years, maybe 500 years -- our study has nothing to do with those time scales." The NASA study is about the bottom of the ice sheet. Climate change has had an impact on the top of the ice sheet. Warmer ocean waters intruding on the ice shelf causes the ice shelves to break up. When grounded ice sheets exit the land and go into the water that causes sea level rise "This study doesn’t discredit that," he says. "Nothing in our paper has anything to do with climate change." We interviewed a few experts on climate change including Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central, a news organization that focuses on climate change. "It merely suggests the presence of a natural contributor to West Antarctic ice sheet melt and instability," he says. "It does not prove that this is the only factor. It does not state that it explains all of West Antarctic mass loss. Saying that a natural heat source disproves any effect of human-caused climate change is just as ridiculous as saying that natural moonlight disproves illumination from a streetlamp." Our ruling The American News headline says "BUSTED: NASA Accidentally destroys every climate change advocate by exposing massive truth behind Antarctica." The story refers to a real study by NASA about Antarctica, but that study doesn’t discredit climate change scientists. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01352	"While (Charlie Crist) was governor, utility costs went up 30 percent and went from below the national average to above the national average. Since I got elected, utility rates have come down 11 percent and now we are below the average."	false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-florida-electric-rates-are-lower-c/	After the brouhaha in last week’s Florida gubernatorial debate over electronic fans, there was a heated exchange between Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist on electric rates. Crist, who won the governorship as a Republican in 2006 and is now running as a Democrat, said the Sunshine State needs new investments in solar energy, and the next governor must stand up to the "utility companies that keep jacking up your bills." Scott, the Republican incumbent, shot back that Crist was playing fast and loose with the facts. "While he was governor, utility costs went up 30 percent and went from below the national average to above the national average," Scott said. "Since I got elected, utility rates have come down 11 percent and now we are below the average." There’s two parts to this fact-check: Under which administration were electric bills higher, and how does that compare to the national average? It’s clear from the conversation and the evidence we received from the Scott campaign that he was talking about residential rates. So that’s what we’ll focus on. Understanding electric rates When you get your electric bill, there’s a good chance you only catch the amount telling you what you owe. But that number is made up of two components: the base rate and cost-recovery clauses. The cost-recovery clause is sometimes called the pass-through clause, because costs incurred by a power company are passed through to customers. The base rate, on the other hand, is essentially how companies get a return on their investment. The largest cost-recovery clause is fuel. Power companies charge consumers for the cost of purchasing the coal, natural gas or other energy sources needed to make their plants go. Just like gas prices at the pump change every time you fill up, fuel prices for power companies can be quite volatile. Fuel prices are also, for the most part, out of the control of any governor. Whether power companies can get cheap natural gas is most often a national issue, not a state issue. With that in mind, let’s look at the data. Who saw higher rates? PolitiFact Florida obtained data on electric rates for the four large investor-owned power companies operating in Florida — Florida Power & Light Co., Duke Energy, Tampa Electric Company and Gulf Power Company — through an open records request with the state Public Service Commission. The information contained the overall rate as well as the base rate and various cost-recovery clauses. For Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy and Tampa Electric, electric rates in the last eight years peaked during the Crist administration. For those three utilities, the high point came in 2009. But in all three cases, the spike was not caused by an increase in base rates. Indeed, base rates were relatively stable across the board during Crist’s tenure. Instead, the higher electric rates were caused by large increases in fuel recovery costs. Take Tampa Electric Company, for example. The base rate in 2009 was the same as it was the day Crist took office: $51.92 per 1,000 kilowatt hours. But customers were paying $128 per 1,000 kilowatt hours in 2009 compared to $114 in 2007. What changed? The cost of fuel jumped $10 per 1,000 kilowatt hours. This was caused by a steep increase in natural gas prices nationwide, said J.R. Kelly, the public counsel for Florida who represents the people of the state in utility-related matters. "That’s nobody's fault or the result of any change by any governor or the Legislature," Kelly said. "No matter who was governor, natural gas prices tripled in costs so all the fuel charges went soaring." A couple of years later, there was a natural gas boom in the United States, and prices dropped considerably. Power companies also credit their own moves to build more efficient plants. What happened to electric rates? They fell as well. You can see this all play out in this chart. Source: Florida Public Service Commission What’s notable is that fuel prices for utility companies continued to fall, but the overall electric rate did not drop at the same speed. That’s because the base rate went up as well. Rate changes are approved by the Public Service Commission, a five-member panel made up of gubernatorial appointees. All five current members were appointed by Scott from a list of names pre-approved by a legislative panel. Those five members were also appointed by Crist, though four of his initial choices were rejected by the Republican-controlled Legislature. Base rate increases occurred under both administrations but are considerably higher under Scott. Total monthly bill for residential services in January (in 1,000 kilowatt hours) FPL Duke Tampa Gulf Base Total Base Total Base Total Base Total 2007 38.12 103.51 41.18 110.34 51.92 114.54 49.3 101.87 2011 43.01 95.01 48.58 119.34 55.45 107.02 49.3 122.67 2014 52.47 99.95 58.50 125.29 60.98 109.61 62.09 132.00 Source: Florida Public Service Commission As you can see, not only is the base rate higher under Scott, but overall rates are also up since January 2011, when Scott took over the governorship from Crist. This despite the fact that fuel reimbursements have fallen considerably since 2011. Florida vs. the national average Scott’s campaign told us he got the numbers from a study on residential electric rates by the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned power companies. According to Scott’s campaign, "the average residential electric bill in Florida (for investor-owned utilities) went from 9.66 cents per kilowatt hour in 2006 to 12.41 cents per kilowatt hour in 2010." First, Scott’s numbers are significantly off, based on the studies provided to us by Edison Electric Institute. We quickly found his mistakes. The average residential bill was 9.66 cents per kilowatt hour in 2005, when Jeb Bush was governor. The average monthly rate was 11.61 cents per kilowatt hour in 2006, when Crist was running for governor and 11.43 cents during his first year in office. The average monthly rate also wasn’t 12.41 cents per kilowatt hour in 2010. That was the rate in 2009. As we noted earlier, that was around the time fuel prices spiked. During Crist’s last year in office, the rate was actually 11.18 cents per kilowatt hour, which would mean the average monthly bill actually went down during Crist’s tenure. There also hasn’t been an 11 percent decrease under Scott. Again, that’s based off an incorrect number for 2010. In 2013, the last year of data available, the average monthly rate was 11.06 per kilowatt hour. The study also does not show that rates were higher in Florida than the national average when Crist left office. When Crist came in, Florida’s average monthly bill in 2006 and 2007 was above the rest of the country. But the national average during his final year in office was 12.01 cents per kilowatt hour, higher than Florida’s monthly average of 11.18. In that measure, Florida has stayed below the national average since. Much of this is backed up by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a clearinghouse for national energy statistics, which includes monthly breakdowns for more accurate timelines. When Crist entered office in January 2007, the average retail price of electricity for a Florida home was 11.06 cents per kilowatt hour. When Crist left office in January 2011, the rate was 11.33 cents per kilowatt hour. So it’s up, but hardly by 30 percent. The increase is actually about 2.5 percent. Also, by the time Crist was sworn in, Florida was already above the national average in residential utility rates by a full penny per kilowatt hour. In fact, the state had been above the rest of the country consistently since October 2005. While there were points that Florida’s residents paid less than the national average during Crist’s term, Florida rates were higher than the rest of the country when Crist finished his four-year term, though by considerably less than when he came in. What about during Scott’s tenure? The latest figures from June 2014 show Floridians on average pay 11.96 cents per kilowatt hour. That’s up 0.63 cents since Scott took office, or 5.6 percent, a larger jump than during Crist’s term in office. The cost of electricity in the rest of the country has increased at a higher rate than Florida, so Scott is right that Florida is now below the national average, but it’s not because rates have decreased under his watch, as he claimed. Our ruling Scott said that while Crist was governor, "utility costs went up 30 percent and went from below the national average to above the national average. Since I got elected, utility rates have come down 11 percent and now we are below the average." Scott is off in a lot of ways. First, his statistics don’t parse out the base rate from the rest of an electric bill, which is critical to understanding how bills go up. Doing so shows base rates for the four large investor-owned power companies have consistently gone up under Scott’s watch. Perhaps more egregiously, Scott’s campaign fumbled the data in a report to make it seem like rates were much lower when Crist took office and higher when he left. We found the right numbers, and it paints a completely different picture. On comparing the state to the rest of the country, data shows Florida’s rates were higher than the national average well before Crist took office, but the gap narrowed during his time in office. Florida is now below the national average, but it’s not because prices dropped under Scott. By several measures overall rates are actually higher now than they were when he took office, despite a decrease in fuel costs. There’s so much incorrect in Scott’s statement. We rate it False.

pomt-10650	"...some of those (tax increases) were either court-ordered, or they were voted on by the people and approved by the people for (such) things as roads."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/03/mike-huckabee/voters-supported-the-roads-not-the-tax/	Mike Huckabee has been telling the same story for a year. Attacked early on for raising taxes more than he cut them, Huckabee began laying the tax increases off on others. There was, for example, that matter of the 3-cent increase in the gas tax in Arkansas in 1999 accompanied by a 4-cent increase in the diesel tax, which is paid mostly by truckers. "You know what we did?" he said to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News last Feb. 11, 2007. "We put it on the ballot, and 80 percent of the people of Arkansas voted for the fuel taxes because they wanted better roads." The voters voted all right – but not on the taxes. Instead, voters approved (by 80 percent) a $575-million bond issue that would be supported by the diesel tax and future federal highway funds. The diesel tax and the gasoline tax were going to take effect regardless of how the public voted. The Arkansas legislature had approved those taxes on April 1, 1999, and the first penny of the gas tax and the first 2 cents of diesel tax were already in effect on June 15, when voters went to the polls that year. (The gas tax rose by a penny each of the next two years, the diesel tax by 2 cents the next year.) The taxes and the bonds were a package plan, and Huckabee was its strong advocate. The plan to sell bonds was in Act 1027, approved by the legislature the same day as the gas tax in Act 1028. Huckabee would be fully justified in arguing that the vote reflected support for the taxes that supported the plan to issue bonds. In fact, he could even argue that the voters were approving the massive additional spending on roads. If the federal grants and diesel tax weren't enough to repay the bonds, the "full faith and credit" of the state stood behind them. As matter of fact, the gas tax wasn't directly pledged at all. But you could also argue the voters had nothing to lose. Their gas tax was going up whether they approved the bonds or not. The bonds made the road-building happen much faster. For Huckabee and an overwhelming majority of legislators, both Democrats and Republicans, the need was clear. That year, and again in 2000, professional truck drivers surveyed by Overdrive magazine rated Interstate 40 across Arkansas, between Memphis on the eastern border and Fort Smith on the Oklahoma border, the worst highway in the country. The Arkansas portion of I-30, which runs between Dallas and Little Rock, ranked fifth worst. The Overdrive annual survey also identified Arkansas highways as the worst overall. The success of the plan is now also clear. By 2005, I-40 in Arkansas was the nation's "most improved highway" in the Overdrive survey, and I-30 was in the top five in that category. "When we put that out there for the people to decide whether they wanted to affirm it, they did by an 80 percent vote," Huckabee said on Fox News' Hannity & Colmes on Nov. 15, 2007. "I'd call that leadership." We'd also call that accurate – because of the phrase "affirm it," which is closer to what voters actually did on the matter. So, does Huckabee's "affirm" language fix his claim as well as he fixed his roads? Alas, the myth of the approved tax continued. On Dec. 30, 2007, on NBC's Meet the Press , Huckabee responded to rival Mitt Romney's attacks on his tax record. "He made claims about things like tax increases," Huckabee said, "but he failed to mention that some of those were either court-ordered, or they were voted on by the people and approved by the people for (such) things as roads." (The "court-ordered" part, which refers to a $400-million increase in the sales tax for education after the Arkansas Supreme Court threw out the state's school-financing system, is also passing the buck. The court ordered a new funding system, arguably even required more spending, but didn't order any tax increase. But that's another Truth-o-Meter.) So how do we evaluate this "voter approval" claim? We can't understand politicians who have a real story to tell and then needlessly fudge some small piece of it. Ruling: Half True.

pomt-04997	Says raising the state income tax rate on millionaires to offset property taxes for other residents is "not a tax increase. It's a tax shift."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/19/lou-greenwald/tax-shift-lou-greenwald-sets-truth-o-meter-ablaze-/	As much as Assembly Majority Leader Lou Greenwald would like to call it something else, a tax increase is still a tax increase. A Democrat from Camden County, Greenwald has proposed raising the state income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million, and then using that new revenue to offset property taxes for people earning up to $250,000. But that’s not a tax increase, Greenwald claimed in a recent TV interview. "First of all, it’s not a tax increase. A tax increase is when you increase a tax that brings in more revenue that you spend in government," Greenwald said during a July 15 interview on "Inside Story" on Philadelphia-based 6abc. "What we’ve offered is to take 16,000 people and have every penny that comes in from them offset property taxes up to 20 percent for 2.6 million filers, the other 8.8 million. So, it’s not a tax increase. It’s a tax shift." Greenwald’s claim doesn’t make any sense, PolitiFact New Jersey found. For the last few months, Greenwald has been leading the charge to raise taxes on millionaires in order to provide property tax relief for residents with annual incomes up to $250,000. The tax hike was initially tied to a proposed income tax credit based on the amount of property taxes paid. More recently, the increase has been linked to providing roughly $800 million in additional property tax relief payments through the state’s Homestead Benefit Program. Legislation sponsored by Greenwald -- Assembly Bill A-3201 -- increases the tax rate on taxable income greater than $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent. Through a separate piece of legislation sponsored by Greenwald -- Assembly Bill A-3202 -- that additional tax revenue would go toward the higher property tax relief payments. The Democrat-led Legislature passed both bills last month, but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed A-3202 outright and conditionally vetoed A-3201. Instead, the Republican governor called on legislators to amend that legislation to implement an income tax credit for homeowners earning up to $400,000 in taxable income. In the TV interview, Greenwald offered a definition of a "tax increase" to explain how his proposal is not one. But that definition -- "A tax increase is when you increase a tax that brings in more revenue that you spend in government" -- matches exactly what those two bills would do. One bill would "increase a tax," and the second bill would "spend" that extra revenue. Brian McGinnis, communications director for Greenwald, maintained in an e-mail that the assemblyman’s proposal is a "tax shift" that would benefit millionaires as well. "When our plan is taking every additional income tax dollar to reduce a local property tax expenditure for 95% of families, it’s a tax shift that ultimately accrues benefits to every family in our state through a lower property tax burden, stabilized property values and increased economic competitiveness," McGinnis told us. The spokesman added: "The Majority Leader has frequently talked about the hidden tax on all New Jerseyans being the hit a family’s property values take because property taxes are so high. In providing significant property tax relief to 95% of New Jersey families, our plan would have addressed this problem—helping to stabilize property values and benefiting people throughout the state, including millionaires. "Furthermore, as the Majority Leader said in the interview, lower property taxes for the middle-class makes our state a more attractive place to live, meaning millionaires (whom the Governor calls job creators) can attract more talented employees." We gave Greenwald a False for a related claim from the same interview in this fact-check. Our ruling During a TV interview, Greenwald offered this description of his proposal to raise the state income tax rate on millionaires and use the extra money to offset property taxes for people earning up to $250,000: "It’s not a tax increase. It’s a tax shift." But despite how the money would be spent, raising any tax rates is clearly a tax increase. Calling such a measure a "tax shift" doesn’t make any sense, and Greenwald should know better. So, here’s three more words to add to his vocabulary: Pants on Fire!

pomt-05314	Says he posted a "win" in the Republican Party of Wisconsin endorsement contest in the U.S. Senate primary.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/17/jeff-fitzgerald/senate-candidate-jeff-fitzgerald-says-he-scored-wi/	By his own assessment, Republican Jeff Fitzgerald "breathed a little new life" into his U.S. Senate campaign with a strong showing at the May 12, 2012, state GOP convention. Fitzgerald edged Mark Neumann in a head-to-head race on the final ballot, giving him some badly needed momentum. But the party ultimately did not endorse, because no one received the required 60 percent of the vote. So did he win the day? Soon after the vote, Fitzgerald posted on Facebook: "Thank you everyone for the tremendous support at the Republican Party of Wisconsin Convention and to have won the majority support! Thank you!" In the days after the convention, he claimed "a win" on Twitter and on his Facebook page, citing a Wisconsin Radio Network Web story headlined, "Fitzgerald climbs to first-place convention finish." "ICYMI: Here's an article covering my win at the Republican Party of Wisconsin's State Convention. The same grassroots activists who support Governor Scott Walker supported me because they want to see bold reforms in Washington!" Fitzgerald, the Assembly Speaker, did not use any form of the word "endorse" -- a prudent move since none of the four GOP candidates (Fitzgerald, businessman and former congressman Mark Neumann, former Gov. Tommy Thompson and businessman Eric Hovde) won the state party’s official support. That set his reaction apart from that of Neumann, who declared "victory" despite finishing second in the final vote, while strongly implying he was endorsed. (We rated that claim False.) Still, even the article cited by Fitzgerald doesn’t go quite as far as calling Fitzgerald’s showing as a "win." Here’s our take on Fitzgerald’s claim. A first-place showing in the final showdown -- and majority support -- do represent a "win" for Fitzgerald. Or, as he tweeted, "success." But the claim needs some clarification in that it was not a formal endorsement -- the prize everyone was seeking. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13847	Says Donald Trump has "bankrupt four separate businesses."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/11/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-donald-trump-has-bankrupt-four-se/	U.S. Sen. Mark Warner says presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a "lot of ammunition" to fire at Donald Trump’s business record. "To think that Mr. Trump is trying to lay out this proposition that he’s a successful business guy. He’s failed miserably, bankrupt four separate businesses," Warner, D-Va., said during a June 21 interview on CNN. We looked at Warner’s contention that Trump bankrupted four businesses. Clinton has made similar charges against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, including on July 6 when she spoke in front of the shuttered Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J.. Earlier this year, many of Trump’s GOP primary opponents also accused him of running businesses into the ground. Kevin Hall, Warner’s communications director, sent us a series of media reports about Trump’s business problems. Some Trump companies indeed have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, which shields businesses from creditors as as they reorganize with hope of remaining open. Under court supervision, the companies devise a plan to pay back some of its liabilities over time. That’s different from a Chapter 7 filing, which involves liquidating a company’s assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors. PolitiFact National has explored several claims about Trump’s business record and has tallied a list of bankruptcies for his companies. Let’s take a look. 1991 bankruptcy Trump’s first bankruptcy came when he sought protection for the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. Trump funded most of the casino’s $1 billion construction by using junk bonds with high interest rates, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. When it sought Chapter 11 protection a year after its opening, the casino had about $3 billion in debt. As part of the restructuring, Trump cut his ownership stake in the Taj Mahal by half and sold his airline as well as his personal 282-foot yacht, The Washington Post said in an August 2015 story. 1992 bankruptcies Two more of Trump’s Atlantic City casinos - the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino - sought Chapter 11 protection amid heavy debt and cash flow problems, United Press International reported at the time. A fourth bankruptcy also occurred in 1992 when Trump sought protection for The Plaza hotel in midtown Manhattan. The hotel, which Trump bought for $390 million in 1988, had accumulated more than $550 million in debt. Trump gave up a 49 percent ownership stake and remained CEO, although he had little control over the day-to-day operations of the company, according to The New York Times. Most recent bankruptcies Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy in 2004 when his casinos - including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana - amassed an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to The Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he still was the company’s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Several years later, Trump Entertainment Resorts - formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts - was slammed by the Great Recession and missed a $53.1 million interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. The company declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After negotiating with the board of directors, Trump resigned as the company’s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump’s name in licensing. All told, the record shows that three of Trump’s Atlantic City casinos as well as The Plaza hotel went bankrupt in the 1990s. His overall casino and resort company went bankrupt twice in the 2000s while operating under different names. So you could argue that five Trump companies have gone into bankruptcy. Beyond the numbers The next question: Is Trump personally to blame for driving these ventures into bankruptcy, as Warner’s statement says? Trump defends his use of bankruptcy laws, saying they’ve allowed him to keep businesses afloat and that he’s rarely relied on them during a career of making hundreds of business deals. In a statement released the day Clinton made her Atlantic City trip, Trump pegged the number of bankruptcies at four. "It is an effective and commonly used practice in business to use bankruptcy proceedings to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs," Trump said in a July 6 statement. Experts told PolitiFact National last September that Trump has had a high number of bankruptcies. But they didn’t entirely blame him for the Chapter 11 filings and noted that most occurred in the gambling industry, which has struggled. A 1991 article by United Press International about the financial woes of the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino said the Atlantic City gaming industry was "depressed" and that nine of the city’s 12 casinos saw declining revenues in 1990, with those two Trump casinos seeing the biggest revenue losses. The New York Times noted in a story earlier this month that Trump’s share of the overall Atlantic City casino market started to fall in 1997, and that while revenues for non-Trump gaming ventures in the city rose over the following five years, revenue at Trump casinos declined. Trump told the newspaper that his casinos ran into trouble because they began competing against each other - a statement that The Times said was "a tacit acknowledgement that he overbuilt." Roger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business magazine, told the Los Angeles Times last year that Trump put his Atlantic City casinos "in so much debt that subsequent managers couldn't manage them properly." But Michael Viscount, an Atlantic City lawyer who represented unsecured creditors during the 2004 Chapter 11 filing of the Trump Hotels and Casino resorts, doesn’t blame Trump for the bankruptcies. He told Forbes magazine in 2011 that he didn’t blame Trump for his Atlantic City casino bankruptcies. Viscount said creditors knew what they were getting into when they lent Trump money. "They’ve all played this game before, in the insolvency space. The company that possessed his name filed bankruptcy because it was overleveraged," Viscount told Forbes. "What does that tell you? People want to lend him money. He does grandiose things with it." Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said in an August 2015 post on a blog dedicated to bankruptcy and credit issues that a Chapter 11 filing alone doesn’t demonstrate a lack of business acumen. Sometimes businesses go bankrupt because of poor management, but sometimes it’s because of factors beyond their control, Levitin wrote. "And indeed, how much, if at all, was Trump involved in the management of the companies?" Levitin wrote. "I wouldn't be shocked if he was basically licensing his name." Levitin told PolitiFact National last September that it’s not fair to put all the blame on Trump for his company’s bankruptcies because he’s acted as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Levitin said. "The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space," Levitin said. "These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him." Our ruling Warner said Trump has "bankrupt four separate businesses." The number, if anything, is conservative. We count five. But beyond the number, Warner’s statement also asserts that Trump was the cause of the bankruptcies, and that’s harder to parse out. There’s no doubt he had a role in many of the failings, having larded his casino operations with huge debts. But analysts note that Trump wasn’t acting alone; he had willing investors who put up big sums of money in the risky gaming industry. There’s also questions about how involved he was in running all of the casinos that bore his name. So on the whole, we rate Warner’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-07887	Says getting ex-cons to successfully return to society is important "so we are not always faced constantly with recidivism, which is a big problem in the penitentiary today – in the 70 to 80 percent range."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/05/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-doubles-tr/	Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder shares the burden with fellow Republican and Gov. John Kasich of filling Ohio’s massive budget hole. And like Kasich, Batchelder believes the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction is a prime target for savings. Specifically, both have talked up reforming sentencing laws to keep more non-violent criminals out of state prisons, which costs millions and unnecessarily adds to an already overcrowded prison system. Ohio’s prisons are currently at 133 percent capacity. Democratic former Gov. Ted Strickland also supported sentencing reform. But Strickland lacked the political muscle to push it through the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate, which didn’t openly support giving some criminals a pass from prison. Republicans in the Senate now like the idea, so says Batchelder, who predicts reform will "pass both houses very early in the session." He made the statement during a Jan. 4 interview on WCPN 90.3 FM’s "Sound of Ideas" radio program. He also said reducing the number of ex-cons who return to prison is critical to any reform effort. "I think it’s important also from the stand point of getting (prisoners) back into society, so we are not always faced constantly with recidivism, which is a big problem in the penitentiary today – in the 70 to 80 percent range." Reducing the recidivism rate has long been a goal of ODRC, so PolitiFact Ohio set out to check Batchelder’s claim, which suggests the prisons system is doing a lousy job of rehabilitating criminals. ODRC tracks the number of released prisoners who return to prison within one, two and three years after incarceration. The latest data available shows that among the 27,482 prisoners released in calendar year 2006, 36.44 percent returned within 3 years for parole and other technical violations or for committing new crimes. The 2006 three-year recidivism rate is down from a 16-year high of 39.01 percent in 2001. The 2007 recidivism rate will be available in a few months, says ODRC communications chief Carlo LoParo. Batchelder didn’t cite the source of the recidivism rate when he spoke on the radio program. His spokesman, Mike Dittoe, said the line is supported by the February 2011 prison study by the Council of State Governments Justice Center called "Justice Reinvestment in Ohio: Policy Framework to Reduce Corrections Spending and Reinvest in Strategies that Can Reduce Crime." That report contains a line, Dittoe says, that reads "One study found that over a period of three years after their release from prison … 70 percent of the individuals placed in the high-risk group were re-arrested." Dittoe said this re-affirms Batchelder’s claim. The line in the study, he says is footnoted to two earlier studies: "Creation and Validation of the Ohio Risk Assessment System: Final Report" and "Understanding the Risk Principle: How and Why Correctional Interventions Can Harm Low-Risk Offenders." But there’s a problem with that line. It is specifically referring to inmates identified as being at "high risk" for recidivism. And when we looked at the report we found another rate listed in the previous sentence: 10 percent for inmates deemed as "low risk." So, where does this put Batchelder’s claim on the Truth-O-Meter? First, for support, Batchelder’s staff cites a report that didn’t exist when he made the original claim. That report refers to two earlier studies that are based on older recidivism data. And when the report lists a 70-percent figure, it is referring to inmates deemed to be at "high risk" for recidivism. Second, Batchelder was responding to a question about the current challenges within the Ohio prison system and said nothing about "high-risk" groups. Figures from the ODRC show an overall recidivism rate of 36.44 percent -- a number that includes all types of offenders and is significantly lower than the "70 to 80 percent range." Batchelder and the ODRC may be in agreement that lowering recidivism is important. And as speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, what Batchelder thinks will go a long way toward setting the agenda in the lower chamber of the General Assembly. But his claim that recidivism "is a big problem in the penitentiary today – in the 70 to 80 percent range" isn’t even close. And to cite as support a misapplied figure from a report that didn’t exist when he made the statement is ridiculous. That’s why we rate his statement as Pants on Fire.	None	William G.

pomt-04669	The "Health Care Compact bill would end Medicare's guaranteed benefit for Tennessee's Medicare recipients and shift management of the federal health care plan to the state's TennCare program."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/07/tennessee-democratic-party/democrats-say-republican-backed-legislation-would-/	Legislation clearing the way for Tennessee to participate in a "Health Care Compact"was supported by Republicans on a virtually unanimous basis during the last legislative session. Now, the Tennessee Democratic Party is trying to turn that support into a liability during the campaign season. In news releases, the party is targeting virtually every incumbent Republican state legislator who faces a Democratic challenger in this fall's election. With minor variations depending on the targeted incumbent, the releases sent to media in East Tennessee districts carried very similar wording. As a sample, the following is from the release that went out in House District 33 in which state Rep. John Ragan, R-Oak Ridge, is being challenged by Democratic former Rep. Jim Hackworth: "Earlier this year, Rep. John Ragan co-sponsored a measure that would eliminate Medicare's guaranteed benefit for 800,000 Tennessee seniors and force them into TennCare." Other releases simply change the name, using the same wording. Ragan was one of 44 co-sponsors in the House of the bill, which fell four votes short of the 50-vote majority needed for House passage in the last hour of the 2012 legislative session – when several Republicans had left the House chamber – after passing the Senate 22-9. All "no" votes came from Democrats in both chambers. During the session, the bill (SB326) was hotly debated by lawmakers with considerable back-and-forth between Republicans and Democrats over what it would – or would not – do. The Democratic party's news release somewhat echoes comments of some Democratic legislators during that debate. "What a lie!" said Sen. Mae Beavers, R-Mount Juliet, who was lead Senate sponsor of the measure, when shown a copy of the Ragan release. "It is obvious my opposition is spreading misinformation to confuse voters into supporting them because their platform is so unpopular in Tennessee," said Ragan in an emailed statement. So who's right? The bill basically envisions state government taking over most major health care programs now operated by the federal government, including Medicare. The idea is for states to join together in a Health Care Compact and petition Congress to give up federal control, sending states all of the federal funding being used to cover program costs – about $11.5 billion in Tennessee's case, according to the Legislature's Fiscal Review Committee staff. Six states have already approved similar health care compact legislation, according to the Health Care Compact Alliance website. They include Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah. Indiana also passed a compact bill, but amended it to say that Medicare would remain with the federal government. In Tennessee, Beavers said the bill was inspired by passage of the Affordable Health Care Act, now widely known as Obamacare, and its impact on state costs for overseeing Medicaid, which provides health care coverage for low-income persons as opposed to Medicare, which covers those over age 65 regardless of income. Beavers said, in fact, that if Obamacare winds up being repealed, she would see no need for a Health Care Compact – though, as things stand now, the quest for passage will be renewed in January. In Tennessee, the state already operates the Medicaid program through the TennCare program. The federal government providing about two-thirds of the funding with the state covering the rest. Medicare is 100 percent federally funded. The Tennessee Health Care Compact legislation, as filed in the past legislative session, is rather vague on what creation of a compact would mean. "The legislatures of the member states have the primary responsibility to regulate health care in their respective states," says one provision of the bill. As to how the legislatures in general, or the Tennessee legislature in particular, would regulate health care – including the guaranteed Medicare coverage for persons over age 65 – it is utterly silent. Beavers says that Medicare could well be left with the federal government, if the Legislature so decides. It seems to us, then, that any declaration of what the bill would mean for Medicare enrollees – or most anyone else -- is speculation, not fact. The Democrats' declaration is founded, first, on the expectation that Congress would go along with turning Medicare over to states that want to run the show – along with the money to pay for it. That is surely a debatable proposition; perhaps even doubtful. And, if the feds did turn everything over to the states, they could attach conditions – say, for example, that current coverage of seniors must be maintained – though legislative sponsors envision the money coming with no strings attached. Next, assuming Congress goes along with the idea and the money is sent to Tennessee without conditions, then the Legislature has to make decisions. That means introduction of more bills, more debate and a chance for citizen input before decisions are made. It's possible that citizens could become alarmed, once they are aware of the possibilities, and legislators would listen. Now, the bill is so open-ended that the Legislature could, granted congressional approval, proceed to change Medicare eligibility rules in all sorts of ways. Invited to defend the assertion made in the news release, Brandon Puttbrese, communications director for the Tennessee Democratic party, provided a lengthy response. Here's part of it: "Were it (the compact) to take effect, Tennessee would receive a block grant from the federal government and also sacrifice hundreds of millions in federal funds by 2014 and billions by 2022 because funding for the compact is not designed to keep pace with medical inflation. "So where do we make up that funding for Tennessee's seniors -- now including baby boomers -- who are going to depend on this care? New taxes? Repealing their millionaire and billionaire tax breaks? "With no guarantees that the federal funding formulas will keep up with medical inflation or changing age structures in the population, Republicans in states like Tennessee are more likely to turn to the time-tested tools for cutting costs. "Those are: changing eligibility standards so that fewer people are enrolled; reducing services provided shifting costs onto beneficiaries and cutting payments to providers." Puttbrese also provided links to testimony in Texas related to passage of a Health Care Compact bill. Part of the testimony involves whether the federal funding could run short in future years in a Medicare takeover. The Legislature's Fiscal Review staff basically assumes it would not under the Tennessee version of the bill, which includes a formula for changes in federal money based on inflation and population. Setting aside that tangential discussion, we note that Puttbrese is making some assumptions and raising hypothetical questions. Which involves, again, speculation and not fact. Further, Puttbrese says that the party has changed the wording on the releasessince our initial inquiry on that wording. The initial releases targeted East Tennessee Republicans; the change was made as releases began targeting Middle Tennessee Republicans, Puttbrese said. Here's the new wording in a release targeting Rep. Jim Gotto, R-Nashville, that replaces the language in the earlier version above targeting Rep. John Ragan: "Earlier this year, Tennessee Republicans, including state Rep. Jim Gotto, co-sponsored the Health Care Compact bill, an extreme measure that endangers the health benefits of 800,000 Tennessee seniors enrolled in Medicare and shifts management of their healthcare plans to TennCare." The key change is to substitute "would eliminate Medicare's guaranteed benefit for 800,000 Tennessee seniors" to "endangers the health benefits of 800,000 Tennessee seniors." With the revision, we think the Democrats have a reasonable assertion, insofar as political endeavors go. If the federal government turned Medicare over to the state Legislature's oversight with no strings attached, as conceivable under the bill, we're not ready to predict what would happen. But the possibility of endangered beneficiaries would be there. Indeed, if the original release language was changed to use the word 'could' instead of 'would,' the party would have a more defensible statement. But we set out to evaluate the original release, not the revised version and not to engage in semantic speculation over what difference the change of a word might have made. The Democrats' declaration that the Health Care Compact bill would eliminate Medicare's guaranteed benefit for Tennessee seniors is False.

pomt-05532	"Women account for 92.3 percent of the jobs lost under Obama."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/10/mitt-romney/romney-campaign-says-women-were-hit-hard-job-losse/	Editor’s note: After this item was published on April 11, 2012, we received an email from the Romney campaign raising several issues about our analysis and asking that we review our work and retract the ruling. Lanhee J. Chen, Romney’s policy director, wrote that our analysis contradicted another ruling written by our partners at PolitiFact Georgia. Chen also criticized us for citing the opinions of two economists with ties to the Obama administration. We considered the complaint and interviewed four other economists, none of whom have formal or financial ties to any campaigns. Our additional reporting found no reason to change our ruling, which remains at Mostly False. Here is our fact-check, with an addendum at the bottom reflecting our new research and reporting. Mitt Romney's campaign wants you to know that the same president who argues for contraceptive coverage and suggests that a Congress with more female members would get more accomplished has also presided over disproportionate job losses among women. On April 6, 2012, Romney’s press secretary Andrea Saul tweeted, "FACT: Women account for 92.3% of the jobs lost under @BarackObama, a claim also made on Romney's website. She followed it up a few hours later with this: "@BarackObama touts policies for women & 92.3% jobs lost under him r women's. He's even more clueless than we thought." When we asked for backup for the claim, the campaign cited national employment figures spanning four years. We found that though the numbers are accurate, their reading of them isn’t. ‘Total nonfarm payroll jobs’ Romney’s campaign pointed to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics employment figures from January 2009, when Obama took office, and March 2012, for all employees and for female employees. Here they are: * Total Nonfarm Payroll Jobs: January 2009: 133,561,000 March 2012: 132,821,000 Net loss: 740,000 jobs. * Total Female Nonfarm Payroll Jobs January 2009: 66,122,000 March 2012: 65,439,000 Net loss: 683,000 jobs. They then divided the net loss among women by the total net loss and came up with 92.3 percent. Beyond the numbers The first problem we find with Saul’s tweet is that it begins counting job losses the first month Obama was in office. We have taken points off previous claims for blaming officeholders for situations that existed at the beginning of their administrations, before their policies have had time to take effect. One could reasonably argue that January 2009 employment figures are more a result of President George W. Bush’s policies, at least as far as any president can be blamed or credited for private-sector hiring. We reached out to Gary Steinberg, spokesman for the BLS, for his take on the claim. He pointed out that women’s job losses are high for that period of time because millions of men had already lost their jobs. Women were next. "Between January 2009 and March 2012 men lost 57,000 jobs, while women lost 683,000 jobs. This is the reverse of the recession period of December 2007-June 2009 (with an overlap of six months) which saw men lose 5,355,000 jobs and women lose 2,124,000 jobs," Steinberg told us in an email. So timing was important. And if you count all those jobs lost beginning in 2007, women account for just 39.7 percent of the total. Gary Burtless, a labor market expert with the Brookings Institution, explained the gender disparity. "I think males were disproportionately hurt by employment losses in manufacturing and especially construction, which is particularly male-dominated. A lot of job losses in those two industries had already occurred before Obama took office," he said. "Industries where women are more likely to be employed – education, health, the government – fared better in terms of job loss. In fact, health and education employment continued to grow in the recession and in the subsequent recovery. Government employment only began to fall after the private economy (and private employment) began growing again." (Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Betsey Stevenson, a business and public policy professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and visiting economics professor at Princeton University, who previously served as chief economist for Obama’s labor secretary, also pointed out that "in every recession men’s job loss occurs first and most, with unemployment rates for men being more cyclical than those of women’s." She added that many of women's job losses have been government jobs -- teachers and civil servants -- which have been slower to come back because they require greater government spending. So have Obama's policies been especially bad for women? Said Stevenson: "I don’t think you could point to a single piece of evidence that the pattern of job loss: men first then women, is due to the president’s policies. It’s a historical pattern that has held in previous recessions." Our ruling Romney's website said that women account for 92.3 percent of jobs lost under Obama. By comparing job figures with January 2009 and March 2012 and weighing them against women’s job figures from the same periods, Saul came up with 92.3 percent. The numbers are accurate but quite misleading. First, Obama cannot be held entirely accountable for the employment picture on the day he took office, just as he could not be given credit if times had been booming. Second, by choosing figures from January 2009, months into the recession, the statement ignored the millions of jobs lost before then, when most of the job loss fell on men. In every recession, men are the first to take the hit, followed by women. It's a historical pattern, Stevenson told us, not an effect of Obama's policies. There is a small amount of truth to the claim, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Addendum We considered the Romney campaign's complaints but do not see any evidence that warrants changing our ruling. The other economists agreed the statement was misleading and, for the most part, said it wrongly blamed Obama for broad trends that were part of a long, deep recession. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said much of the decline for women was in the public sector. "To the extent there have been excessive job losses among women, a lot of it has to do with the fact that there has been an enormous reduction in state and local government employment," Bartlett said. "The decline ... has been especially pronounced in this recession as opposed to other recessions." This chart from the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed group, bears that out. In earlier recessions, public-sector jobs began increasing again as the economy stabilized. After the most recent recession, they have continued to disappear. Again, these are jobs heavily held by women. Bartlett added that many of those government jobs were eliminated in states controlled by Republican governors and legislatures. This story in the Atlantic cited a study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute finding that the 11 states that went Republican in 2010 accounted for 40.5 percent of all state and local government job losses. Jeff Hayes is a senior research analyst with the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, an organization affiliated with George Washington University’s public policy graduate program that receives contributions from groups including the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Hayes added that "there’s a lag before the lost tax revenue catches up and government jobs are lost. "If you break out the 683,000 jobs women lost between January 2009 and March 2012, 64 percent were in government and only 36 percent in the private sector." That leads us to a point made by Eileen Appelbaum with the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research. She noted that after the first wave of money in the president’s stimulus bill had run out, Obama asked for another $23 billion in "emergency aid" for state and local governments. The money was sought to avert the layoffs of as many as 300,000 public school teachers, but House Republican leaders stripped it. "You could hardly blame Obama for that," Appelbaum said. As for the comparison with the PolitiFact Georgia item, such direct comparisons are tricky. In this case, the Georgia ruling was on the simpler question of the job creation under President Ronald Reagan, while the Romney claim omitted the critical detail of the loss of jobs for men before Obama took office. Other fact-checking organizations have examined Romney's claim and come to similar conclusions. The Associated Press said using the 92.3 percent figure as a measure of Obama’s record on women was "dubious at best." First Read, a politics blog by NBC News, had this to say: "Does anyone believe, with a straight face, that nine in 10 job losses over the past three years have been women workers?" And the New York Times disputed the emphasis on the job losses occurring "under Obama." "Presidents get too much credit or blame for changes in the business cycle. Contrary to what seems to be popular opinion, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Obama had or have the unilateral ability to steer the country into good or bad job markets. Neither would a President Romney," Times economics writer Catherine Rampell wrote in the Economix blog. We’ll conclude with this point: Experts agree that the economic recovery has not helped women as much as men. Howard Wall, an economics professor at Lindenwood University, said it’s fair to fault Obama for that. But he took issue with the timeframe of the Romney campaign’s claim -- starting in January 2009 while the recession was still on. "I think you have to kind of divide the timeline. Call it the Bush recession and the Obama recovery," Wall said. "I don’t give them (the Obama administration) credit for stopping the fall or causing the fall. They had nothing to do with that. But they own the recovery." Does all this mean that Obama’s policies have brought hard times to women? Said Bartlett, the conservative: "There’s no reason to think so."

pomt-12937	Says Donald Trump campaigned on not cutting Medicare and Social Security, but his nominee for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, "made his career on cutting Medicare and Medicaid."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/10/charles-schumer/schumer-trump-and-his-hhs-pick-tom-price-odds-medi/	Newly minted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blasted the incoming administration for already abandoning campaign pledges in an interview on MSNBC. For example, he pointed to Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon and President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. "Price, the guy from HHS, Donald Trump said when he campaigned he wouldn't cut Medicare and Social Security, but he turns around nominates as his HHS secretary, guy who made his career on cutting Medicare and Medicaid," Schumer said on Jan. 3’s Rachel Maddow Show (around the 14:10 mark). "We’re going to slam him on these things." Trump certainly promised to keep health care programs for seniors (Medicare) and the poor (Medicaid) intact and to protect Social Security (which doesn’t fall under HHS’ jurisdiction). But what about Schumer’s characterization of Price’s record on the health care programs? Price has supported reducing the government’s role in Medicare and Medicaid and reducing spending on the programs. That would be a major change of course from how the programs ran under the Obama administration. Trump’s pledges Throughout the course of the 2016 election, Trump largely promised to protect or save Social Security and Medicare and instead to crack down on waste and fraud, with a few detours. Trump tweeted that he would leave all three safety nets intact in May 2015, a month before he made his official presidential announcement (in which he said the same thing). During the election, Trump continued to promise to protect Social Security and Medicare during debates, numerous campaign events, multiple interviews and campaign ads. He even seemed to suggest expanding Medicare or Medicaid in some instances and (falsely) accused Hillary Clinton of wanting to cut them. Post-election, Trump’s incoming chief of staff said Trump intends to keep those promises. Trump’s health care plan, released in March 2016, proposed to turn Medicaid into a "block grant" program but didn’t specify what that would look like. (Typically, block grants set a cap on the amount of federal funding to states for Medicaid instead of the current structure of the federal government matching state spending.) Price’s career A doctor and staunchly conservative policy wonk, Price has made health care one of his legislative priorities in his 20-year stint as a public servant. Price, who had his own orthopedic clinic in northern Atlanta, first ran for state office in 1996. During his time in the Georgia State Senate from 1997 to 2005, he sponsored legislation "to increase patient choice, enact Medical Savings Accounts, and reform the Medicaid system," according to his Georgia legislature biography. In 2006, he ran for and won former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s old seat, spurred at least in part from outrage over the rising cost of malpractice insurance (tort reform is another pet issue of Price’s). Price has focused on reducing government oversight of health care and shifting to more private insurance. The first piece of legislation he introduced was a resolution "recognizing the need to move the nation's current health care delivery system toward a defined contribution system," which would be a move away from employer-provided coverage as it exists today. He also sponsored bills to increase Medicare payments to doctors, allow doctors to enter into private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries and charge the program for their services, and called for implementing cost-saving measures in Medicare and Medicaid. After Obama’s election, Price emerged as one of the leading opponents of the president’s signature Affordable Care Act. "While the stated goal (of health care reform) remains noble, as a physician, I can attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government’s intrusion into medicine through Medicare," Price wrote in a 2009 column in Politico that advocated for "a third way that puts patients in charge." He has introduced a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare every legislative session since 2009. Price’s Empowering Patients First Act instead provides tax credits to help pay for private insurance plans and expands health savings accounts. The Price plan also allows for people to opt out of Medicare and Medicaid (and other government-run health programs) and choose the tax credits to purchase private plans instead. It folds in his previous advocacy of private contracting between Medicare beneficiaries and doctors. Beyond his own proposals, Price supported Paul Ryan’s 2011 budget plan, which would have eventually moved Medicare toward private insurance by giving people under 55 voucher-like tax credits to purchase plans. This is also called premium support. When he became chairman of the House budget committee, Price was the primary author of a budget for fiscal year 2016 that included $900 billion in spending reductions to Medicaid (through block granting) and $148 billion to Medicare (by leaving the Obama administration’s cost-saving measures intact), according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Price’s budget for fiscal year 2017 similarly sought: $1 trillion from Medicaid and $449 billion from Medicare. After Trump’s election, Price expressed optimism that lawmakers could overhaul Medicare in 2017. Did Price cut Medicare, Medicaid? For all of Price’s efforts to change Medicare and Medicaid and reduce spending, nothing actually came to fruition. Whether Price’s supported policies amount to "cutting" the health program or making it more market-oriented is a matter of debate, though he clearly wants to reduce the government’s role in Medicare. Schumer’s office pointed to Price’s comment on Medicare being government intrusion and his support for Medicare overhaul as evidence for Schumer’s claim. But a Trump transition team spokesman told us Price "has long been a champion for strengthening Medicare for both current and future beneficiaries" and believes that "Medicaid provides a crucial safety-net for millions of Americans." Experts, meanwhile, were divided over whether Price’s proposals amounted to "cutting" Medicare and Medicaid. The Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonpartisan health care advocacy group, typically doesn’t weigh in on cabinet appointments but opposes Price’s nomination precisely because of his position on Medicare, said David Lipschutz, the group’s senior policy attorney. "The policies he has advocated would significantly cut and alter Medicare," Lipschutz told us, listing Price’s support for a premium support model, opposition to allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and advocating for private contracting between Medicare beneficiaries with physicians with Medicare footing the bill. Gail Wilensky, the former director at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, called Price’s comment on Medicare as government intrusion a "gross exaggeration." But Wilensky preferred to characterize Price as a supporter of Medicare reform. She added that like Price, she supports premium support as a model for Medicare reform, as do prominent Democrats Alice Rivlin, a health care policy expert who served under President Bill Clinton, and Bob Reischauer, a fellow at the left-leaning Urban Institute. Our ruling Schumer said, "Donald Trump said when he campaigned he wouldn't cut Medicare and Social Security" but his nominee for the Secretary of Health and Human Services "made his career on cutting Medicare and Medicaid." Price, Trump’s HHS pick, has supported reducing the government’s role in Medicare and block granting Medicaid, which would amount to spending reductions to both programs. While it’s clear these proposals would reduce federal spending on the health safety nets, experts say it’s not the same thing as gutting the programs entirely. Trump did pledge to leave Medicare and Social Security alone, and Price’s positions seem at odds with that. (It’s worth noting that Social Security isn’t administered by HHS).

pomt-06650	Says Rick Perry and the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature "managed to slash the budget of the volunteer fire departments in our state by 75 percent in the last legislative session," reducing their abilities to fight recent wildfires.	false	/texas/statements/2011/sep/13/jim-hightower/jim-hightower-says-rick-perry-and-republican-legis/	Liberal pundit Jim Hightower, the former Texas agriculture commissioner who lost that post to then-state Rep. Rick Perry in 1990, doesn’t think much of Perry as governor—including, Hightower says, his budgeting for volunteer firefighters. Appearing on MSNBC on Sept. 6, 2011, Hightower said Perry’s "own state officials" say wildfires ravaging the state were inevitable due to hot dry, windy conditions and because "Perry, with his Republican supermajority in the Legislature, managed to slash the budget of the volunteer fire departments in our state by 75 percent in the last legislative session." Hightower shortly added: "People's homes are burning down because of his failure to stand up, not today ... but months ago, and indeed a couple of years ago, to fund our firefighting capability so that we could stand up to this." Readers brought Hightower’s comment to our attention just as we were reviewing a similar claim by liberal commentator Thom Hartmann, who wrote in a Sept. 7, 2011, blog post on the TruthOut website that Perry "cut his state’s volunteer firefighter program by 75%—reducing funding from $30 million down to $7 million for the critical program to prevent wildfires." Granted, the wildfires have been widespread, destroying homes and taking lives. But did Perry and the Republican-controlled Legislature knock down funding to volunteer fire departments and did that reduction hamper the response to recent wildfires? To back up his claim, Hightower’s office pointed us to a Sept. 7, 2011, National Review blog post and a March 23, 2011, news report by Austin’s KVUE-TV, both mentioning legislated cuts to a state fund that helps volunteer fire departments purchase clothing, equipment and training. The cuts took effect Sept. 1, 2011, the start of the new fiscal year. To learn more, we called the Texas Forest Service, the agency responsible for protecting the state’s forests and related natural resources and preventing and putting out wildfires. In an interview, Robby DeWitt, who administers financial operations for the service, told us that counting employee benefits, the agency was appropriated $83 million for 2012-13, down from $117.7 million in 2010-11, a 30 percent drop. DeWitt said the forest service did not ask lawmakers to maintain its previous funding, since state leaders, facing a multi-billion-dollar revenue shortfall, had instructed all agencies to tighten belts. In a handout, though, the forest service notes that it can request additional money to cover its firefighting bills; indeed, the 2011 Legislature approved $121 million to pay the costs of fighting fires earlier this year and in previous years. "Given the ongoing, severe drought and fire season, TFS will have to request additional funding for fire bills during the next legislative session," the handout says. The next regular session is in 2013, though the governor can call a special session before then. Among the agency's legislated cuts: A reduction in grants for volunteer fire departments from $23.25 million a year in 2010-11 to $7 million in 2012-13. According to the agency, the grants help provide equipment and training to volunteer fire departments. That money will be prioritized now, the agency says, to cover training, protective equipment and clothing. As of Aug. 12, 2011, nearly $155 million in grants had been awarded over the years to cover or help cover the cost of training, emergency fire equipment, trucks, tankers, communications systems and computers. Another 24,000 grant requests, seeking nearly $340 million total, were on file. The cut will have an impact, the handout says, with grants for large equipment put on hold "until funding can be restored (hopefully during the next legislative session)." The remainder of the service’s overall budget reductions "will result in less agency equipment replacements, reductions to operating budgets and" the elimination of any vacant positions, the agency says, while the service "will continue to fight wildland fires and the budget cuts will not hinder our response." Perry effectively agreed to a 70 percent reduction in grants—not 75 percent—when he signed the state budget into law in June. Still, we wondered if the budgets of volunteer fire departments were socked as a result. Seems not. In an interview, Don Galloway, a forest service policy and planning analyst, said volunteer fire departments operate independently from state government, depending on local funding to cover operating costs. Local departments are the first responders to wildfires, he said, with the state enlisted if necessary; the state requests federal help if that’s needed. The grants that got whittled did not and do not cover the operating costs of any volunteer fire department, Galloway said. Finally, we wondered how volunteer fire departments view the grants’ cut. Chris Barron, executive director of the State Firemen’s & Fire Marshals’ Association of Texas, whose members include volunteer fire departments, said in an interview that the association was happy lawmakers approved the $7 million a year for the grants at a time huge cuts hit other state-backed entities. Barron, who is the chief of the Manchaca Volunteer Fire Department, agreed that legislators don’t appropriate money to fund volunteer fire departments, which mostly rely on local sources including donations. He followed up by email, saying there is "not a reliable/constant source of funding for most of the volunteer fire service of Texas." So, Barron said, the state grants help volunteer fire departments stay afloat by helping them pay for training and equipment that they would be hard-pressed to cover by themselves. Upshot: Hightower’s statement, suggesting Republican legislators slashed the budgets of fire departments on the front lines of the wildfires, misrepresents the cuts in state grant funding for equipment and training as if they were a direct cut to volunteer fire departments. The state doesn’t fund the operating costs of local departments. It’s also incorrect to conclude that the cut to the grants’ fund hampered any department’s effort to combat recent wildfires; the reduction just took effect. Hightower's statement rates False.

pomt-07629	Says the state’s rainy day fund is "our insurance policy against a major natural disaster."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/mar/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-rainy-day-fund-insurance-policy-de/	Gov. Rick Perry opened a March 14 "tele-town hall" hosted by Empower Texans, a conservative group, by mentioning the earthquake in Japan. The devastation there, Perry segued, supports a cautionary note about using the state’s rainy day fund. "One of the things that I remind people, in why it is so important to protect that (fund) is... it is our insurance policy against a major natural disaster" such as a huge hurricane barreling up the Houston Ship Channel. "And for Texas to be caught in a situation where (it) did not have a substantial buffer in that (fund), it could be catastrophic" to the economy, he said. The next day, Perry agreed that the Legislature could take $3.1 billion from the fund to help cover a deficit in the current state budget, which runs through August. But he said he would not support tapping it for the 2012-13 budget being drafted by lawmakers. We fixed on whether the fund, in place since 1988, is the state’s insurance policy against a major natural disaster. Helpfully, the January-February 2011 issue of Fiscal Notes, a publication of the state comptroller’s office, has an article on the fund’s history. It says that in 1988, voters adopted a constitutional amendment creating the fund, formally called the Economic Stabilization Fund. The 1986 oil slump, which drove down state tax revenues, was still fresh in Texans’ minds, according to the article. In a recent interview with Austin’s KUT-FM, Billy Hamilton, a former deputy state comptroller, said the fund was formulated to "protect ourselves from future economic shocks." The fund accumulates money from shares of oil and/or gas production taxes; it also receives half of any unencumbered state revenue--unspent dollars not reserved for a specific purpose--at the end of every two-year budget period. Sharp increases in natural gas prices have boosted the fund, which held nearly $8.2 billion at the start of the 2011 legislative session in January and is projected to be $9.4 billion at the end of August 2013. Since 1990, the recap says, some $11 billion has been deposited into the fund, which has also earned $580 million in total interest. Some $3.5 billion has been spent from the fund over the years, including more than $3 billion during Perry’s tenure as governor. A February report by the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which wants lawmakers to use the fund in the current budget crunch, quotes a May 1987 summary of the proposed constitutional amendment that was prepared the House Research Organization: "Should the state ever face another fiscal crisis like the current one, there would be money put aside for the state to fall back on. If the Economic Stabilization Fund existed now, the Legislature might not be facing the difficult choice between falling short of maintaining current state services and raising taxes in difficult economic times. Money could be appropriated from the fund to support existing programs." According to the report, the ballot language by which voters approved the amendment in 1988 stated: "The constitutional amendment establishing an economic stabilization fund in the state treasury to be used to offset unforeseen shortfalls in revenue." Under the amendment, lawmakers may appropriate money from the fund for several stipulated reasons, including anticipated dips in state revenue. But those stipulations seem to pale in light of a provision giving lawmakers sweeping authority, with a two-thirds’ votes of the members present in each body, to "appropriate amounts from the economic stabilization fund at any time and for any purpose." Whoa--any purpose, any time! Next, let’s look at how the state has spent its rainy day revenue. Comptroller spokesman R.J. DeSilva provided a detailed breakdown showing that over the years, rainy-day funds were appropriated to public education, health and human services, child protective services, the teacher retirement system and prisons, among beneficiaries. In 2003, lawmakers diverted $295 million in rainy-day dollars to launch an enterprise fund overseen by Perry to lure businesses to the state. Two years later, more money was taken from the fund to start an emerging technology fund overseen by the governor. The breakdown shows one disaster-related tap; the 2003 Legislature allocated $6.4 million to reimburse the Department of Human Services for "previously expended disaster assistance payments." So, nearly all fund expenditures have gone to purposes other than natural disasters. Our take: Perry’s claim might reflect his opinion that the fund should be saved -- literally -- for stormy days. Still, it’s factually misleading. The purpose of the savings account was to buffer the state against economic shocks. To date, a small portion of the money has been spent in connection with a natural disaster. That leaves Perry’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04533	"Since the time of the Civil War, we've made a distinction in this country between the availability and the ability to access for people who were in the military, versus the rest of us, to vote."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/01/mike-dewine/special-voting-access-military-nothing-new-dates-c/	Mike DeWine was ready to fight. In the wake of a federal court decision that restored absentee voting the weekend before Election Day for military and civilian voters, DeWine was ready to duke it out in court some more. At an Aug. 31 news conference, DeWine expressed his displeasure with the decision by a federal judge which ruled that all Ohio voters would get a chance to vote in-person absentee the weekend before Election Day. As attorney for the state, DeWine's office had argued that only military voters should be eligible to vote in-person absentee but the judge ruled otherwise stating that to allow only one group of voters access to the polls amounted to unequal protection under the law. The judge's decision in Obama v. Husted was an affirmation of the position of President Barack Obama's campaign which had argued that you couldn't treat military voters any different than other voters. But DeWine disagreed, and as he spoke at his news conference about the state's appeal he cited what he said was a long history of absentee voting for military members. "Since the time of the Civil War, we've made a distinction in this country between the availability and the ability to access for people who were in the military, versus the rest of us, to vote," DeWine said. "And we've made that distinction because of the unique situation the people in the military are in. We've done this now for about 150 years, and so this is not anything new." Really? Has the United State allowed absentee voting by military members dating back to the Civil War? We decided to rustle up our musket, our finest blue and gray duds and check it out for ourselves. We first turned to DeWine's office who responded quickly with a few references from legal briefs filed with the court. Several footnotes to the legal briefs mentioned the same source--a University of Michigan Law Review Journal article by John C. Fortier and Norman Ornstein. The article, entitled The Absentee Ballot and the Secret Ballot: Challenges for Election Reform, traces the history of absentee voting in the United States. And lo and behold, the authors find the Civil War was largely the starting point for absentee voting laws. "The early impetus behind absentee balloting was war; making sure that soldiers on the battlefield were not disenfranchised by their military service," it states. "The Civil War inspired the first major effort for absentee balloting in the United States." Fortier and Ornstein tally up 19 of 25 Union states and 7 of 11 states in the southern confederacy as having had absentee voting laws for soldiers during the Civil War. Prior to the Civil War, it appears that only Pennsylvania had military absentee voting thanks to a law passed in 1813, which allowed soldiers stationed more than two miles away from home to vote absentee, the authors state. Furthermore, one of the citations provided by DeWine's office points to a U.S. Court of Appeals decision which references the Civil War as the starting point. "Absentee voting began during the Civil War as a means of providing soldiers the right to vote," reads a snippet of the U.S. Ninth District Court of Appeals 2001 decision in Voting Integrity Project v. Kielsing. So it seems clear the Civil War was the starting point for all but Pennsylvania. But that doesn't mean those laws stayed on the books as DeWine implies. Turning again to Fortier and Ornstein, the authors state "these laws applied only to military voting, and most were discontinued after the end of the (Civil) War." A scholarly article co-authored by Daniel Tokaji, an OSU professor, arrives at much the same conclusion. "Yet, according to a 1915 survey, absentee ballots disappeared after the Civil War, to the point that only six states retained military absentee voting statutes," it reads. This had changed drastically by 1924, when all but three states had absentee voting laws on the books for military and civilians, the article states. Reached at his Columbus office, Tokaji said absentee voting for the military largely began in the Civil War but did not continue unnterrupted for the last 150 years. "There has been some waxing and waning over the years," he said. "It's not a story of steady progress over the years as time has marched on." So where does that leave us? At a news conference following a federal court decision that cited equal protection law and ordered absentee voting for all voters the weekend before Election Day, Mike DeWine said the decision was wrong. In part, DeWine said that was because military voters and civilian voters have been treated differently dating back to the Civil War. He also implied that it has been that way uninterrupted since the Civil War. The historical record seems to be undisputed that absentee voting for the military went from being allowed only in Pennsylvania prior to the Civil War to being allowed in most Union states and a majority of the confederacy during the Civil War. However, those laws were repealed in most states following the Civil War. By 1915 only six states still had military absentee voting. That changed in the decade that followed and those laws appear to have stayed on the books ever since allowing absentee voting access for military voters. DeWine was partially correct. Special absentee voting privileges have been extended to military voters dating back to the Civil War. However, he also implied that those laws have been on the books for the past 150 years. This is true only in a handful of states, the vast majority of states had to reenact military voting statutes after 1915. That’s important information his claim leaves out that put the statement in full context. On the Truth-O-Meter, DeWine’s claim rates Half True.

pomt-04296	Says opponent Chad Chadwell "wants condom techniques demonstrated to your children."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/nov/01/tere-mccann/round-rock-candidate-says-school-board-president-w/	A November 2012 challenger to the president of the Round Rock school board says the incumbent, Chad Chadwell, "wants condom techniques demonstrated to your children." The claim appears in a leaflet sent to voters by Tere McCann which also says: "Scientific sex education helped reduce teen pregnancies in Round Rock. But Chadwell thinks that now we need to actually demonstrate condom techniques to thirteen-year-olds." That text appears below what looks like a sheet of paper listing a "class schedule" with the subjects history, geography and math crossed out in red with "condom techniques" yet to be struck. On its reverse side, the mailer mentions the Round Rock Leader newspaper and also says the Austin American-Statesman reported Chadwell saying that he "supported showing students how to effectively use a condom." Asked the basis of his claim, McCann directed us to his campaign manager, Bill Gravell, who pointed out news stories in the Leader, a twice-weekly Williamson County newspaper, and American-Statesman. A Leader news story posted online Oct. 17, 2012, says that six days earlier, the Round Rock school board discussed an August 2012 advisory panel recommendation to shift to an "abstinence-plus" sex education curriculum from the existing approach of teaching abstinence only. According to the story, the proposed curriculum would feature "at least one lesson on effective use of contraception methods, beginning with eighth-grade students and continuing in high school, according to information presented to board members in August." By telephone, Susan Nix, a district official familiar with its sex education curriculum, told us middle-school students are not now taught about contraception, though contraceptive methods, including condoms, are mentioned in high-school classes otherwise stressing the benefits of abstinence. According to the Leader story, board member Catherine Hanna said during the board’s October gathering that students should be given complete information about the effectiveness of condoms. "Giving children the incomplete information about condom effectiveness steers them away from condom use if they choose to have sex," Hanna said. "If we want to stress using condoms effectively, why not show them?" The article says Chadwell said he agreed with Hanna, regarding showing students how to properly use a condom. "I would rather risk making a few students and teachers feel uncomfortable and show them condom use and prevent some teen pregnancies," Chadwell said, according to the article, which quotes the district superintendent, Jesús Chávez, as saying that members can bring the recommendation up again at the board’s Nov. 15, 2012 meeting. On Oct. 20, 2012, the Statesman published a summary of the Leader story stating Hanna and Chadwell had said they supported showing students how to effectively use a condom. McCann’s campaign subsequently highlighted Chadwell’s quoted comment in a press release headlined "Teaching Middle School students how to put on a Condom is Not Consistent with the Values of Round Rock." The release says that according to the Leader, Chadwell wants to teach middle-school students how to put on condoms. "Do we really want to be showing our 13-year-old children how to use condoms?" McCann said in the release. In reaction, Chadwell emailed a statement to reporters that does not directly contradict McCann’s description of his remarks. The statement says that no specific ages were mentioned at the board meeting and that the board had asked the superintendent to "prepare an age-appropriate sex ed curriculum" for middle- and high-school students with a staff recommendation to be presented at the Nov. 15 board meeting. Seeking detail, we watched the district’s video recording of the meeting, which showed that board members heard a presentation by Blair Murphy of Scott & White’s "Worth the Wait" program, which provides the district’s middle-school sex education curriculum. Murphy told board members that the proposal would result in a lesson covering several contraceptive methods including condoms joined by the message that abstinence is the only completely effective, healthy method. Condom demonstrations would not occur, Murphy said. "We do not do condom demonstrations in the classroom," she said. "We won’t be showing students how to use a condom with a fruit or anything like that." A slide summarizing the condom portion of the lesson says "facts you need to know" are that condoms should be consistently used correctly; that they have a higher pregnancy result than some other methods; and that a condom should only be used once. Asked by a board member (not Chadwell) why students are not shown how to use condoms, Murphy said that’s probably best done in a private setting with a health professional who can give advice. According to the video, Chadwell did not explicitly mention showing students condom use. That’s contrary to his quotation in the Leader story later echoed in the Statesman. Then again, Chadwell initially told his colleagues a story about the ineffectiveness of instructing residents in a foreign country by placing a condom on a stick. He then said: "My view is I would rather risk offending a few peoples and students, embarrassing them a little bit, if it stops a few pregnancies, and if that’s what that means." Adding that the idea of abstinence is "great," Chadwell continued: "So at the risk of offending a few people, I would almost rather have it as a standard, of saying that we are going to teach everything that is going to be embarrassing." Later in the meeting, Chadwell agreed with Chávez, the superintendent, who said he was taking the discussion as a sign the district should initiate a lesson on contraceptives extending from eighth grade into high school, though Chávez said he would like more discussion of whether condom use should be taught and whether the contraception lesson should be implemented this school year. By phone, we asked Chadwell what he meant by telling the story of the ineffectiveness of instructing individuals by putting condoms onto sticks. He said the point was to emphasize the importance of teaching about contraceptives in a way that truly educates students. "I don’t want the school district to show a very G-rated version of a sex education program that is not (also) effective," he said, adding that what students are taught should be based on guidance from curricular experts. We asked, too, what Chadwell meant by saying the district would be teaching "everything that is embarrassing." He replied that the topic of sex education is embarrassing. He then speculated that students could be taught about proper condom use with an animation or illustration or another expert-endorsed approach, though he said he has not warmed to--and did not advocate--classroom demonstrations of any birth-control devices. Our ruling McCann said Chadwell "wants condom techniques demonstrated to your children." This statement has an element of truth in that Chadwell supports a developing proposal that could lead to students from eighth grade into high school being taught about contraceptive methods, including condoms. However, Chadwell was not explicit about supporting classroom condom demonstrations, we learned. It’s notable, too, that the presenter who stirred board discussion declared that condom demonstrations are not part of the contemplated lesson. These critical facts are absent from McCann’s claim. All told, we see a gaping difference between supporting a lesson on various contraceptive methods and advocating show-and-tell condom demonstrations. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

pomt-02797	Says in the last five years "Senate Republicans have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/03/carla-axtman/have-senate-republicans-filibusted-every-nominee-e/	When Senate Democrats voted last month to end use of the filibuster for certain presidential nominations, they said they had little choice in light of Republican obstruction. "To the average American, adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said "This is not about Democrats versus Republicans. This is about making Washington work — regardless of who is in the White House or who controls the Senate." But just how stuck was the Senate? In a recent blog post, Blue Oregon writer Carla Axtman painted a pretty dire picture: "The Senate has been in a grind for a very long time, but the worst of it has come in the last five years where Senate Republicans have placed a filibuster on every piece of legislation and every nominee," she wrote. "The body was for all practical terms in paralysis, requiring a 60 vote majority to do anything." She doubled down on the point a few sentences later: "All the while, the GOP kept right on filibustering. Not just some of the time. ALL of the time. Every move in the Senate required a 60 vote majority to do anything." If there’s one truth about us fact-checkers, it’s that superlatives draw our collective eye. The Senate had experienced significant gridlock, but could it be true that Republicans filibustered "every piece of legislation and every nominee"? We decided to look. As usual, we started with the source of the claim. Axtman, to her credit, immediately toned down her piece after we raised concerns. It now reads that Republicans had "placed a filibuster on virtually every piece of serious legislation and nominee." (Emphasis ours.) "I was not as clear as I should have been," Axtman said. "I should probably have added a qualifying word in there. … To be fair, I thought I should change it. "It’s super important to me to be upfront and clear." We appreciate a quick response. Still, we generally push forward with a fact check on the original language even if it’s adjusted. To help explain what she’d based her assertion on, Axtman pointed us to a piece from Mother Jones, a liberal-leaning magazine, that explored the use of the filibuster. Authors Kevin Drum and Jaeah Lee used strong language to describe Republican obstruction, but nothing near as absolute as what Axtman had said. "Republicans went into full-bore filibuster mode the day he [President Barack Obama] took office, and they've kept it up ever since," they wrote. "For all practical purposes, anything more controversial than renaming a post office has required 60 votes during the entire Obama presidency." That 60-vote bar is a reference to the number of votes it takes to achieve cloture or end a filibuster. You’ll notice here, though, the caveats of "for practical purposes" and "anything more controversial than renaming a post office." They gave themselves wiggle room. To get a broader, more informed perspective, we rang up James Thurber, the head of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington, D.C. In terms of judicial and bureaucratic nominees, he said, "this culture of polarization has created an almost-constant threat of filibuster from the Republican Party." But, he noted, "that’s not as bold as saying they’ve filibustered every nomination." In fact, Republicans cut a deal in July after Democrats threatened to change filibuster rules. "Democrats agreed not to change the rules, but reserved the right to do so later if they feel the need. In return, President Obama gained confirmation of several nominees," the Los Angeles Times reported. Gina McCarthy, for one, was confirmed as head of the Environmental Protection Agency a day after the deal was made on a vote of 59-40. Clearly some nominations, though fewer than with previous administrations, were approved without having to pass the 60-vote bar. (PolitiFact National has looked more closely at this issue. By their calculations, on Nov. 21, 2013, there had been "68 individual nominees blocked prior to Obama taking office and 79 (so far) during Obama’s term, for a total of 147.") There’s another point worth making, too. Legislation faced less threat of filibuster than appointments. "In most cases, it’s a done deal before they consider the bill on the floor," Thurber said. There’s little question that Senate Republicans took using the filibuster as a tool of obstruction to a new extreme. But Axtman undercut herself by using superlatives. Twice in her piece, she hammered home that filibusters happened "not just some of the time. ALL of the time." While we appreciate her move to change the words after we brought them to her attention, we rate this claim False.

pomt-06137	Says a trash mound on U.S. 290 is 800 feet tall.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/dec/22/richard-franklin-iii/richard-franklin-says-trash-mound-us-290-800-feet-/	Travis County commissioner candidate Richard Franklin III has a number of issues he wants to address on behalf of eastern Travis County, and one of them gets bigger every week. At the Central Texas Democratic Forum on Nov. 29, 2011, Franklin said: "There’s a trash mound on (U.S.) 290 that’s 800 feet tall." Franklin later told us he’d like to see leaders use more recycling and technology to reduce or eliminate the pile. His figure grabbed our attention, considering the tallest building in Austin is the Austonian residential tower, which is 683 feet tall. Another common reference point is Mount Bonnell, often called the highest point in Austin, which is 784 feet tall, according to the city. But there’s an important distinction: The Austonian’s 683 feet are measured, as is normal for buildings, from base to top; Mount Bonnell’s 784 feet are measured, as is normal for geographical features, from sea level. Franklin told us the site he meant was Republic Services’ Sunset Farms Landfill in eastern Travis County, on Giles Road north of U.S. 290 about three miles west of Manor -- and he met us on the side of the road, in view of the landfill. From there, the mound rises gradually, with a thin covering of grassy vegetation up its sides, to a cap of garbage. A bulldozer and compactor busily rumbled around the top as birds circled. We talked with Franklin about the landfill’s height limit in relation to sea level, which touched off local debate a few years ago when Allied Waste, the predecessor to Republic Services, sought to raise the limit from 720 feet above sea level to 795 feet by filing a new permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The 2006 request was met by opposition from neighbors and the Austin City Council, according to Austin American-Statesman news stories. The council passed a resolution in May 2007 opposing Allied’s application, but later dropped its opposition after Allied agreed to close the landfill Nov. 1, 2015, the paper reported. The Statesman reported that on Sept. 9, 2009, the state environmental commission granted Republic’s permit with the 795-foot limit. Travis County Commissioners Court records from Sept. 29, 2009, show that the commission voted to approve the permit after questioning Republic officials about the height of the landfill relative to Mount Bonnell. Project engineer Ray Shull told them that with the surrounding land at 640 feet and the cap at 795 feet, the final pile itself would max out at 155 feet above ground level -- "not anywhere close to the tallest structure, even man-made, in Travis County." When we inquired, the state environmental commission reported a slightly lower base elevation for the site -- 613 feet, spokeswoman Lisa Wheeler said. Lee Kuhn, Republic’s general manager for the Austin area, separately said that "ground level" at the site varies from 610 feet to 640 feet above sea level. So depending on where an observer is standing, the mound might appear to gradually rise 155 feet to 185 feet -- though only if Sunset Farms reaches the permitted height. Republic no longer expects that to happen, area president Brad Dugas told us, in part because the economic slowdown has caused area businesses and industries to produce less waste. When we visited the landfill, it stood about 75 feet short of the limit, according to Republic officials -- so it appeared to crest 80 to 110 feet above us, depending on where we stood nearby. Kuhn and Republic area environmental manager Michael Stewart told us the highest parts of the landfill have lately been 720 feet above sea level. As Republic continues building the hill, Stewart said, the highest part will eventually be a two-acre crest, with the rest of the mound sloping down across its 251-acre footprint. In comparison, both Mount Bonnell's 784-foot elevation and its apparent height are greater. From the trailhead on Mount Bonnell Road, the rise from the bottom of the steps to the top of the limestone peak is 227 feet, according to Kim McKnight at Austin’s Parks and Recreation Department. And to a viewer on Lake Austin, where the water’s surface is kept about 492 feet above sea level, the peak should appear 292 feet high. We got back in touch with Franklin, who said it matters to him how tall the pile is compared to sea level. "It’s 800 feet above sea level, with a hundred-foot mound of trash that you can actually see," Franklin said. To evaluate the statement itself, let’s look at the words again: "There’s a trash mound on (U.S.) 290 that’s 800 feet tall." That’s close to right when comparing the top of the pile to sea level, but we think it’s more reasonable to judge the view from ground level -- and that’s where the statement is way off. We rate Franklin’s claim Mostly False.	None	Richard Franklin III	None	None	None	2011-12-22T16:16:58	2011-11-29	['United_States']
pomt-05126	Ronald Reagan "raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/25/gerry-connolly/rep-gerry-connolly-says-reagan-raised-taxes-during/	U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-11th, recently invoked the name of Ronald Reagan to drum up support for raising taxes for a new stimulus program. During a June 5 floor speech, Connolly lamented the refusal of House Republican leaders to allow the American Jobs Act to come up for a vote. The bill, proposed by President Barack Obama, calls for $447 billion over 10 years to pay for infrastructure and school improvements, new job training programs, unemployment insurance, and temporary tax cuts for working families and small businesses. The stimulus would be funded by levying taxes on corporations and people earning more than $1 million a year. Connolly said the House, in considering the legislation, should ask, "What would Ronald Reagan do?" "Many Republicans decried the use of additional revenue to help offset any increase in national debt," Connolly said. "Apparently, they forgot that when faced with rising deficits, Ronald Reagan looked to revenue increases, broadening the tax base, closing loopholes and raising taxes. Yes, he raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987." Did the Gipper really raise taxes during five years of his presidency? We checked. Let’s start by noting that if you recall Reagan as tax cutter, your memory is good. Reagan campaigned in 1980 on reducing taxes. During his administration, the top income tax rate decreased from 70 percent in 1981 to 28 percent in 1986. But to combat a rising deficit and debt burden, Reagan also approved increased taxes. In 1982, The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act raised taxes by $37.5 billion per year, and the Highway Revenue Act raised the gasoline tax by $3.3 billion. In 1983, Reagan signed off on legislation to raise payroll taxes and tax Social Security benefits for some higher earners. In 1984, the Deficit Reduction Act included increases in taxes on estates and distilled spirits and ended some business tax breaks, to the tune of $18 billion per year. In 1985, Reagan signed legislation making permanent a 16-cent federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes, then worth about $2.4 billion a year. In 1986, the Tax Reform Act lowered the top income tax bracket from 50 percent to 28 percent. To pay for the reductions, however, the legislation closed a number of tax loopholes. In 1987, Reagan signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act that extended the telephone excise tax and eliminated a real estate tax deduction loophole. So it’s accurate to say Reagan increased levies during five years of his administration, but there’s a caveat: The overall tax burden on businesses and individuals went down during his presidency. We examined data from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that computes the nation’s tax revenues as a percentage of its Gross Domestic Product -- the total of all goods and services produced. When Reagan took office in 1981, federal taxes were 19.6 percent of GDP, the highest level since World War II. That figure dropped to 17.3 percent during his first term and rose to 18.2 percent at the end of his second term. For comparison, federal tax revenues for this fiscal year are estimated at 15.8 percent of GDP. Reagan’s efforts to cut top income tax rates at the same time he was increasing defense spending created strain, and the federal debt rose from $994 billion at the start of his first term to almost $2.9 trillion at the end. As a result, Reagan was willing to accept and sometimes promote proposals that would close loopholes and create a broader tax base, according to C. Eugene Steuerle, who organized the Treasury Department's 1984-86 tax reform effort and is now a fellow at the Urban Institute and Tax Policy Center. This April, President Barack Obama said Reagan "understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal, he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases." PolitiFact National rated the claim Mostly True, noting that Reagan did not repeatedly propose increases but agreed to tax hikes put forth by Congress. Our ruling Connolly said Reagan, as president "raised taxes" in 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. Reagan did, in fact, sign off on at least one tax increase during each of those years. Some of the increases were modest in scope. And it’s important to note that overall U.S. taxes, when measured as a portion of the nation’s GDP, went down during Reagan’s presidency. But there’s no doubt that Reagan was willing to cut budget deals that included raising revenues. We rate Connolly’s statement True.

Harris, who currently serves as Winnebago County Executive, spoke about a variety of topics ranging from education funding to gas taxes and differences from his opponent. Our focus is on Harris’ proposal for how to raise the minimum wage. Instead of giving one specific amount that he thinks should be the minimum wage, Harris said that raising the minimum wage too much could be unsustainable for certain businesses and may lead to unemployment. Harris proposed “something more like 50 percent or 60 percent of the prior year’s average wage…it would come out closer to nine dollars, that might be a more realistic first step.” The Observatory checked if 50 or 60 percent of the previous year’s average hourly wage is actually nine dollars. Harris suggested updating the wage periodically and that the wage is indexed so “that people don’t wallow at that wage for years and years before it’s updated again.” 	mostly true	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/03/how-will-the-minimum-wage-change/	None	None	None	Noah Broder	None	How will the minimum wage change?

pomt-10048	The Congressional Budget Office "estimates that only 15 percent of this stimulus package will be spent in 2009" and only 37 percent in 2010.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/09/pat-roberts/choices-CBO-numbers-2009-2010/	One of the catch phrases for the stimulus has been "timely, targeted, temporary." Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said the bill was none of those things, attacking it on the Senate floor on Feb. 5, 2009. We were particularly interested in his claim that it was not timely. The Congressional Budget Office, Roberts said, "estimates that only 15 percent of this stimulus package will be spent in 2009; 37 percent, 2010; the remaining part spent in 2011 and beyond. Less than half the money will be spent by the end of next year. This is not immediate relief that families and businesses desperately need now to help get the economy back on track." We wondered about this because Democrats counter that the bill is timely, with as much as 80 percent of the money being spent in the first two years. Roberts' office pointed us toward a letter from the Congressional Budget Office dated Jan. 28, 2009. There it is in black and white: "About 15 percent of that spending would occur in the remaining several months of fiscal year 2009; another 37 percent would be spent in 2010. A total of almost 80 percent of the cumulative 11-year spending would occur from 2009 through 2011." Case closed, right? Not quite. The numbers the CBO referred to applied to spending from the House version of the bill introduced on Jan. 26, but left out what many people consider a key stimulative impact of the bill: its tax cuts. Also, the CBO considered spending according to fiscal years, which begin on Oct. 1. So when the CBO said that spending for 2009 is only 15 percent, it meant spending by Sept. 30, 2009, not the full calendar year. Additionally, Roberts made his remarks on Feb. 5. Yet, just three days earlier, the CBO had published a new analysis on the Senate version of the bill. The Senate version got its spending out of the gate faster: Using the same method of looking at only spending and not tax cuts, the CBO data showed that 20 percent would be spent in 2009, and 38 percent in 2010. That would push the money spent in those two years to 59 percent, which would be more than half spent by the end of the fiscal year 2010, which is Sept. 30, 2010. If you include the tax cuts in the Senate version, the bill's overall impact for 2009 and 2010 are 79 percent of the total package. So that is where the Democrats got their numbers in response. All are legitimate numbers from CBO reports, depending on how you pick and choose the data. Finally we should also note that none of this data addresses the late-night compromise reached by Democrats and three Republican senators on Feb. 6, 2009. As of this writing on Feb. 9, the CBO analysis of the compromise was still in the works. So we have several problems with Roberts' use of the CBO numbers. He uses numbers for a House bill in a Senate debate, when data on the Senate version has been available for several days. He refers to the stimulus "package," but he uses figures that take into account spending only, ignoring the benefits of tax cuts. His statement leaves the impression that the Senate bill would do little by the end of 2010, and we find there's a lot in the CBO data to contradict that. For these reasons, we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04002	Says each year approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire, and about 80,000 people are wounded.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/08/joyce-beatty/rep-joyce-beatty-says-about-30000-people-die-gunfi/	The pre-Christmas slaughter of 20 elementary school children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school has renewed public debate over how to prevent future mass killings with guns. On Jan. 14, members of the Congressional Black Caucus, now chaired by Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge, weighed in on that question by delivering a series of speeches on the House of Representatives floor that decried a U.S. "culture of violence." Newly elected Columbus Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty used the opportunity to deliver her first oration on the House of Representatives floor. In it, she lamented that "mass killings have gone from being an extremely rare occurrence to a common occurrence," and suggested the U.S re-examine its funding for mental health services, place adequate controls on ammunition and "ensure proper and tighter access to firearms." "According to Harvard Health Policy Review, each year approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire, and about 80,000 people are wounded," the former Ohio state legislator noted, applauding President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for "proactively taking the necessary steps to address this critical issue." We wondered whether Beatty’s statistics were accurate, so we decided to track them down. We soon found an article in the Fall 2001 issue of Harvard Health Policy Review, titled The Costs and Benefits of Reducing Gun Violence, that begins with the exact wording used by Beatty - "Each year, approximately 30,000 people in the United States die as a result of gunfire and about 80,000 are wounded." But the date of that article gave us pause. The numbers it cited were more than a decade old. We wanted to find more recent numbers. We turned to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics to verify the information. The latest available version of its data says there were 31,672 firearms deaths in the United States during 2010, a ratio of 10.3 deaths per 100,000 people. That number is a bit higher than the number Harvard Health Policy Review cited in 2001, although it is certainly in the ballpark. The second set of CDC data we examined tracks non-fatal gun injuries. By the CDC’s reckoning, there were 73,883 non-fatal firearm injuries in 2011, a rate of 23.7 injuries per 100,000 people. That number is a bit lower than the number Beatty cited from the Harvard Health Policy Review, although it isn’t too far off. If the number of non fatal injuries from BB or pellet guns were added into the mix, the number of injuries from 2011 would exceed Harvard’s estimate of 80,000 yearly wounds from gunfire. According to CDC, 16,451 people in the United States were hurt by pellet guns - about 5.3 incidents per 100,000 people. Beatty accurately represented the statistics printed in Harvard Health Policy Review, even though its tally was more than a decade old. More recent data indicates those numbers haven’t changed much over the years. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Joyce Beatty	None	None	None	2013-02-08T06:00:00	2013-01-14	['United_States']
pomt-05406	Says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as "tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-streetlights-c/	Is our stimulus money paying for traffic lights on Chinese streets? A TV ad running in eight states blames President Barack Obama for sending stimulus money overseas while Americans are out of work. "Tell President Obama, American tax dollars should help American taxpayers," the narrator says. Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims. Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to "educating citizens about economic policy" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012. Here’s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill: Washington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China. We’ve rated two claims from the ad, about stimulus tax credits supposedly funding a plant in Mexico (Pants on Fire) and paying for jobs in Finland (False). In this fact-check, we’re examining if those tax credits included "tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China." (We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.) The ad said its source for the China claim was a Pittsburgh Tribune-Review article, "Stimulus money pays for street, traffic lights made largely overseas." Traffic lights in China As the ad’s narrator talks about China, the words, "Stimulus money pays for street, traffic lights …" "in China …" appear on the screen, over an image of a traffic light that’s slowly layered with the deep red and yellow of the Chinese flag. The ad was clearly suggesting U.S.-funded lights on Chinese streets. It wasn’t until we pulled up the Tribune-Review article we realized the ad’s claim could be heard another way. Oh! Lights built in China, for American streets. But even that clarification didn’t get us to the complete story. The Tribune-Review article, by Lou Kilzer, a reporter who has won Pulitzer prizes for investigative reporting and public service, digs into grant money — not tax credits, as the ad claimed — awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It says that tens of millions of stimulus dollars went to replace streetlights and traffic lights across the country with energy-efficient versions — "made mostly in Asia." The reason? Certain components of those energy-efficient street and traffic lights, such as light-emitting diodes or LEDs, weren’t available in large enough quantities from U.S. manufacturers back in 2010, so the Energy Department issued a waiver to the Recovery Act’s "Buy America" provision for those parts. The department found such components were manufactured "almost exclusively in China and Mexico." That was February 2010. The Energy Department withdrew its waiver eight months later after at least one manufacturer of LED lights moved some work from Mexico back to the United States. Suddenly, enough parts would be available to satisfy stimulus grant recipients. They’re now once again subject to "Buy America" provisions. But, back to those eight months — could tens of millions of dollars have gone toward building street lights in China? That’s not clear. But it’s also not proven by the Tribune-Review story, which talks not just about China, but also about Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. (We suspect the admakers chose China to make it sound more outrageous.) Meanwhile, the companies building the streetlights told the Tribune-Review that "their products would be better labeled ‘assembled in America’ than ‘made in America.’" One example: Leotek Electronics USA, based in California. It’s a subsidiary of Taiwanese companies, Kilzer reported. Leotek bought some of its LEDs from Philips Lumileds, an American subsidiary of a Dutch company. More than half of Philips’ manufacturing production capacity is based in China. Note the complex path to a finished streetlight, as described by Kilzer: • Philips produced the first component, semiconductor wafers, at its San Jose, Calif., plant. • It shipped the wafers to Singapore, where they were cut into chips and sent to Malaysia. • Malaysian workers molded them into LED modules. • Some of those LED packages went to Leotek in Taiwan to be put on circuit boards. • Boards and streetlight housings got shipped to Leotek’s plant in Milpitas, Calif., where workers combined them with ‘U.S.- and non-U.S.-made components’ for assembly. Kilzer said Leotek won more than a dozen stimulus street and traffic projects. We found one such project, for the City of Palo Alto, which paid $355,281 from a stimulus grant to Leotek for LED streetlight fixtures. About 60 percent of its total grant of nearly $640,000 went toward fixtures, including others from GE Lighting and Genlyte Thomas Group. But more than 40 percent was spent on software and consulting services and installation. So, did some stimulus money end up spent on parts made in China? Yes, according to Kilzer’s reporting and a now-withdrawn Energy Department waiver indicating the parts were available there when they weren’t widely manufactured in the United States. Did it add up to tens of millions of dollars? Kilzer’s piece talks about that amount of money being spent "to replace streetlights and traffic lights nationwide," and says the new, efficient lights would be made "mostly in Asia" — not just China. It’s not clear whether Kilzer’s number also includes installation, consulting services and other non-fixture expenses — the kind of stuff that consumed 40 percent of Palo Alto’s grant. (We asked him, but didn’t hear back.) It is clear that the "tens of millions" reflects spending for American-assembled lights that included varying amounts of foreign-made components. But it's an exaggeration to say they were built in China. None of this evidence supports the strong suggestion in the ad that Americans paid for streetlights on roads in China, or even that they paid to build streetlights in China. Instead, for less than a year, stimulus funds could be used to buy products that used components produced in other countries, including China. Our ruling We watched this ad and imagined Chinese street corners with shiny new American-funded traffic lights. The reality is nearly the opposite: American cities, counties and states bought and installed new energy-efficient street and traffic lights with stimulus grants. Many of those lights contained foreign components, including some from China, but it’s simply not clear how much stimulus money went toward those parts during the eight months it was allowed. The ad’s claim has a tiny sliver of truth, but it pairs words and images to create an altogether different impression. We’ll have to put the brakes on this traffic light claim, and rate it Mostly False.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2012-05-03T18:22:35	2012-04-26	['China']

pomt-13012	A recent study found "that cities where Uber operates have 3.6%-5.6% fewer drunk driving deaths than cities without access to ridesharing."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2016/dec/09/uber/uber-cherry-picks-data-study-about-drunken-driving/	More than 43,000 people in upstate New York opened the app for the Uber ride-sharing service the night before Thanksgiving. Their attempts to catch a ride failed. New York State does not allow the ride-hailing service north of New York City. Uber hopes to persuade state lawmakers to change that during next year’s legislative session. It has collected more than 100,000 signatures on an online petition asking lawmakers to allow the service upstate. "Uber can also make New York a safer place to live by reducing drunk driving throughout the State," the petition reads. "A recent, independent study conducted by Temple University found that cities where Uber operates have 3.6%-5.6% fewer drunk driving deaths than cities without access to ridesharing." The company repeated that claim in a press release last month. So is Uber right? Does ride-sharing reduce drunken-driving deaths? What Temple University found Since Uber’s launch in 2010, the service has expanded from San Francisco to more than 100 U.S. cities. Temple University released its study in early 2015, and by then the ride-hailing service had already expanded to New York City and several other U.S. cities. The study attempted to find whether the Uber service changed the rate of drunken driving deaths. Uber got half of the study’s findings correct. Researchers Brad Greenwood and Sunil Wattal found a 3.6 percent to 5.6 percent reduction in drunken driving deaths in cities where Uber was introduced between 2009 and 2014. But the study looked at only cities in California. The study did not include comparable data from the other cities where Uber operated in the same time period. Greenwood says he’s working on an analysis for all of the cities, but the conclusion of that study won’t come soon. National studies A pair of researchers from Providence College and Stonehill College released a similar study earlier this year with a national perspective. Sean Mulholland and Angela Dills looked at 150 cities and counties where Uber operated between 2010 and 2013. They found a 6 percent decline in fatal crashes in cities after Uber becomes available. But they concluded the effect on drunken-driving deaths is insignificant. "When we look specifically at fatal crashes where alcohol is involved we find a negative relationship, but the estimated coefficient is not statistically significant," Mulholland said. "Therefore we are unable to say whether there is an increase or decrease in alcohol-related fatal crashes when Uber enters a location." Mulholland said they found a 9 percent to 18 percent decrease in drunken-driving arrests in Uber locations. Another study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology from researchers at the University of Oxford and the University of Southern California, also found no effect on drunken driving deaths after Uber became available in 100 metropolitan areas in the United States. "Findings reveal that the deployment of Uber services in a given metropolitan county has no association with the number of subsequent traffic fatalities," the study found. Our ruling Uber claims a Temple University study "found that cities where Uber operates have 3.6%-5.6% fewer drunk driving deaths than cities without access to ridesharing." But the study looked only at California cities. Two national studies found the service had no effect on drunken-driving deaths.

pomt-09651	"In the past year, more than 20 percent of Americans have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan. They conclude we shouldn't be there."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/04/alan-grayson/polls-afghanistan-show-mixed-picture/	President Barack Obama gave a major speech Dec. 1 to make the case for increasing troops in Afghanistan. But antiwar Democrats still say it's the wrong decision. One of those Democrats is Rep. Alan Grayson of Florida. The night before Obama's speech, Grayson appeared on MSNBC's The Ed Show to argue against sending more troops. "We have people now who are in first grade and second grade who have never known an America their entire lives that was an America at peace. And I think it's time we thought about that, thought about what we're like as human beings and as a country. We need to pursue peace," Grayson said. Host Ed Schultz asked Grayson what should be done to oppose the policy. "What we always do," Grayson said. "Organize, organize and organize. Tell the president, tell our elected representatives, and hope that we can build bridges among enough congressmen so that we can tell the president honestly that this war should be over. And I've been following the polls and I've seen that, in the case of Afghanistan, the polls are shifting. In the past year, more than 20 percent of Americans have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan. They conclude we shouldn't be there. And that's what we need to do. We need to change people's minds." We wondered if Grayson was right about a dramatic shift in the polls on the war in Afghanistan. As usual with polls, a lot depends on how you ask the question. We asked Grayson's staff what polls he was referring to, and they pointed us to a USA Today/Gallup poll taken from Nov. 20-22, 2009. The poll question: "Do you approve or disapprove of the way Barack Obama is handling the situation in Afghanistan?" The poll showed a 20-point drop in approval for Obama. In July, 56 percent of respondents said they approved of how he was handling Afghanistan. In November, 35 percent approved. But we don't think approving of Obama's handling of Afghanistan is quite the same as saying Americans "have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan" and think we "shouldn't be there." More on point might be the Gallup poll that asked the question, "Thinking now about U.S. military action in Afghanistan that began in October 2001, do you think the United States made a mistake in sending military forces to Afghanistan, or not?" The answer to that question has been relatively stable. In November, 60 percent said no, we didn't make a mistake. In July, it was 61 percent, and in August 2008, it was 63 percent. We also found this question from the ABC News/Washington Post poll: "All in all, considering the costs to the United States versus the benefits to the United States, do you think the war in Afghanistan has been worth fighting, or not?" In November, 44 percent said yes, it has been worth it. In July that number was 51 percent, and last December it was 55 percent. That's a decline of about 11 points, not more than 20. In reviewing a number of polls about Afghanistan, the approval for Obama's handling of Afghanistan has seen a particularly wide swing this year. This could be because he's displeasing both antiwar Democrats and more conservative Republicans. We should also note that these polls were before his speech, and that it's possible such a high-profile speech could improve Obama's ratings. Grayson said, "In the past year, more than 20 percent of Americans have changed their mind about the war in Afghanistan. They conclude we shouldn't be there." But that 20 percent number represents displeasure with Obama and not the dropoff in support for the war, which is at just 11 percent. And another measurement -- whether people believe the United States made a mistake by sending forces to the country -- has remained stable. So we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02742	Florida’s proposed medical marijuana amendment "would make Florida one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states, allowing use for limitless ‘other conditions’ specified by any physician."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/dec/17/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-says-amendment-would-make-florida-one-mo/	If there’s one issue sure to spark up a debate in Florida, it’s medical marijuana. United for Care, a medical marijuana advocacy group, is in the middle of a petition campaign to place a medicinal cannabis bill on the November ballot. The campaign has until Feb. 1 to qualify, but Attorney General Pam Bondi isn’t waiting that long. On Oct. 24 her office filed a challenge to the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that the summary of the amendment on the ballot is designed to mislead voters. The court heard arguments on Dec. 5, 2013, and has until April 1, 2014, to rule. Among the claims made in the brief is that the 74-word summary doesn’t go far enough to explain the extent of how the amendment would affect state law. "The proposal hides the fact that the Amendment would make Florida one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states, allowing use for limitless ‘other conditions’ specified by any physician," the brief reads. "With no ‘condition’ off limits, physicians could authorize marijuana for anything, any time, to anyone, of any age," it continues. "But rather than tell voters of this extraordinary scope, the summary uses language to prey on voters’ understandable sympathies for Florida’s most vulnerable patients — those suffering ‘debilitating diseases.’ " We’re not here to dispute whether the proposal is hiding anything from voters; that’s for the state Supreme Court to decide. But is Florida’s proposed amendment lenient compared with the rest of the country’s medical marijuana laws? It’s going to take us some time to roll that one up. Allowing medical marijuana for 'other conditions' Twenty states currently have medical marijuana laws, and all of them have at least a partial list of specific medical diagnoses that can be treated with cannabis. These diseases typically include cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, or wasting syndromes like cachexia, although the lists vary by state. (We should note that among those 20 states, Colorado and Washington state voted in 2012 to decriminalize marijuana altogether.) The Florida amendment spells out its covered diagnoses as cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, hepatitis C, ALS, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. But it also allows for "other conditions for which a physician believes that medical use of marijuana would likely outweigh the potential health risks for a patient." Any other use would have to fall under that rather open-ended description. It’s the "other conditions" that Bondi and others say is a major loophole. Florida Sheriffs Association President Grady Judd has argued that by using the term "condition," there’s a virtually unlimited number of ways that can be applied, including muscle spasms and menstrual cramps. We found that Mostly True. Other state laws use words like "other conditions" to allow for diseases or symptoms not mentioned in their statutes. Usually there is a process to petition a state board or other group to allow medical marijuana use for one of those conditions after it’s approved by a doctor. Florida’s law would not require the creation of such a board to approve a disease or symptom not listed -- only that a doctor give a written recommendation. (To abide by federal law, no state requires a prescription, only a recommendation.) Only two other states, California and Massachusetts, have laws that are that relaxed. Massachusetts only requires written consent from a doctor, while California lets patients get medical marijuana with merely verbal recommendations (for example, a dispensary calls a doctor to verify a patient who doesn’t have written documentation, which is an uncommon occurrence). Neither state requires a board to approve requests. United for Care campaign manager Ben Pollara said the loose requirements for the approval process in Florida was by design. "Health care decisions should be made between a doctor and their patient not by whether it is included or excluded on an arbitrary list drawn up by lawyers, politicians or bureaucrats," he told PolitiFact Florida. Other states have slightly stricter guidelines for what constitutes a non-specified conditions. Alaska, for example, has an approval process for any "debilitating medical condition" with symptoms such as pain, nausea or seizures. Montana gives leeway for severe pain with a second doctor’s opinion. New Hampshire makes exceptions for other conditions including severe pain or if current treatments result in side effects like nausea, vomiting or muscle spasms. New Mexico also allows for severe pain, if a doctor and the state agree other treatments won’t work (hospice patients are allowed, too). Vermont will let patients treat severe pain, severe nausea, or seizures if other efforts have failed -- or if those conditions are caused by other treatments. Jennifer Meale, communications director for Bondi’s office, confirmed to PolitiFact Florida that the wording in the initial brief was intended to apply only to the amendment language referring to "other conditions," which are described as "debilitating diseases" in the ballot summary. "Other aspects of the amendment weren’t considered in this way," she said. "That’s the portion that was misleading." Cultivation, distribution and possession restrictions In regards to overall leniency, however, there is much more to consider than just the definition of what could be covered. The Florida law would not, for instance, protect patients growing their own plants, which 15 states permit to some degree. Michigan and Montana, for example, don’t specify there have to be medical marijuana dispensaries, according to pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Dan Riffle, so cultivation at home is a common method for patients to maintain a supply of the drug. Arizona lets you grow marijuana plants if you live more than 25 miles from a dispensary. Instead, the Florida amendment outlines that the state department of health or some other designated agency must regulate a dispensary network, a requirement by 14 states. (States are limited to regulating the distribution network instead of operating it, lest the states open themselves up to a violation of federal law.) Furthermore, the proposal does not contain wording on possession limits, which also vary by state. "Most allow 2 to 2.5 ounces, but some are as low as one ounce, and some are as high as 24 ounces," Riffle said. "The Florida initiative leaves that up to the Department of Health to determine, and they'll probably say 1 to 2 ounces if this passes." Riffle added the amendment also does not carry any protections for housing or employment discrimination against patients or caregivers. One example he gives is how in Arizona, a licensed patient cannot be fired from a job for failing a drug test. The Florida law makes no mention of such instances. Riffle said the Florida proposal overall "is a relatively average medical marijuana law," not as restrictive as places like Connecticut, Illinois or New Jersey, but not as liberal as California, Arizona or Massachusetts. Vanderbilt Law School professor Robert Mikos agreed that by using the term "conditions" in its language for recommendations, the Florida amendment is "on the lenient side." But, he added, "it looks like Florida is going the more restrictive route by requiring the use of treatment centers and licensing and regulation through the state." Even the language for doctor recommendations is a little stricter, he said, such as saying the benefits of approved cannabis use "would likely outweigh the potential health risks," instead of wording it that drug use "might benefit" a patient, as is used by some other states. Our ruling Bondi’s office is arguing the proposed Florida Amendment is worded loosely enough in its definitions of what could be treated by the drug that it would put it in league with "the most lenient medical-marijuana states." The Florida proposal would allow doctors to make recommendations for marijuana use without getting approval from a designated state agency, a rare guideline. Only two states with medical marijuana laws, California and Massachusetts, allow patients to obtain cannabis this way. But if we look at the amendment’s approach to regulation, distribution and registration, it’s a different picture. Florida actually places plenty of restrictions on these categories, moving the proposal closer to the middle of the pack. Bondi’s brief didn’t focus on those other considerations. Some outside experts feel it’s a little misleading to say Florida will become "one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states" without explicitly couching it in terms of getting an unspecified condition approved for treatment with only a doctor’s written recommendation. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2013-12-17T09:59:37	2013-10-24	['None']

pomt-03694	If an individual is determined "to commit suicide, the availability of a gun is not a factor" because they will find a way.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/21/michael-chippendale/ri-state-rep-michael-chippendale-says-guns-dont-in/	More than 60 percent of the 31,000 gun deaths in the United States each year result from suicide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One of the arguments used by supporters of gun control is that restricting access to guns could prevent some of those suicides. Some gun-control opponents dispute that, arguing that suicidal people will simply find another way to kill themselves. Those opposite positions were expressed when WPRI-TV taped a debate April 12 on "Newsmakers" featuring two state representatives -- Republican Michael Chippendale of Foster and Democrat Linda Finn of Middletown. Finn said gun-related suicides are "primarily young adults, young men having access to firearms and killing themselves." "If an individual is under enough emotional or psychological distress where they’re going to commit suicide, the availability of a gun is not a factor," Chippendale responded. He went on to explain, "There’s bridges to jump off. There are drugs to take. There are plenty of ways, if one is in such a state of mind to dispatch their own lives, where they will do it. The availability of a gun is not what makes a person commit suicide, mental illness is. A firearm is a tool." We were interested in Chippendale's assertion that the availability of a gun is not a factor in whether a person commits suicide because suicidal people just find other ways to end their lives, a phenomenon researchers refer to as "substitution." Chippendale sent us to two studies to support his claim. The first, done in Australia and published in 2010 in the Medical Journal of Australia, compared suicide rates before and after the country instituted strict gun restrictions and a gun-buyback program. After one fifth of the guns were taken out of circulation, gun-related suicides decreased but suicides by hanging increased, suggesting that at least some people were switching to that method. (The low rate of gun use in Australia made it difficult to be definitive.) The other study was published in 1992 by the New England Journal of Medicine. Chippendale highlighted a chart saying that although having a gun in the home made it 4.8 times more likely that a successful suicide would occur, there were other factors such as whether someone was using illicit drugs, or had been hospitalized due to drinking, or was taking mental illness medication. But it didn’t address the substitution issue. The chief author, Dr. Arthur Kellermann, now a senior policy analyst at the Rand Corporation, said he published a more-relevant study in 1990 that compared suicide rates in Seattle and neighboring Vancouver, similar cities with different gun cultures. That analysis found that while the risk of gun suicide was more than twice as high in gun-friendly Seattle, that was offset by the fact that non-gun suicides were 1.5 times more common in Vancouver. "There is evidence of substitution," but it's far from universal, he said. It's mostly likely in cases where someone is hell-bent on killing themselves. "For younger groups and suicides that are more impulsive, I think that ready access to a highly lethal means does make a difference. In many of those cases, if they survive the attempt, they are grateful they didn't die and have a chance at getting their act together." In contrast to the few studies Chippendale offered to support his statement, we found several more that didn't. In addition, other suicide experts with whom we spoke said bluntly that Chippendale is wrong because suicide is usually an impulsive act, and having a gun available dramatically increases the chance that any attempt will be successful. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of those who use a gun die, compared with 3 percent to 6 percent of those who try by another means, according to various studies. Most people who survive one attempt don't try again. "If you are determined, you will eventually find a way to die. What people don't understand is for many suicidal people, that period of intense suicidality doesn't last that long," said Catherine Barber of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center. Among people interviewed after they nearly died from a suicide attempt, 71 percent said they had only felt suicidal for one hour or less before they tried to take their lives and only 13 percent said it was a day or more. And other data suggest that most people don't look for other means of suicide if a gun isn't handy. A soon-to-be-released Harvard study found that in 16 "high-gun" states where 50 percent of the households have a firearm, the total number of suicides in 2008 and 2009 was 11,889. In six "low-gun" states with a comparable population, there were half as many suicides -- 6,038. The reason: the rate of firearm suicides was a whopping 77 percent lower than in the "high-gun" states. The same trend is clear in earlier data from 1999 to 2007. And it's not because people are less-prone to suicide in "low-gun" states. In fact, the estimated number of suicide attempts was 23 percent higher in the low-gun states. So, Barber asked, if Chippendale were correct, "why wouldn’t we simply see more non-firearm suicides in the low-gun states and roughly equal suicide rates across the two groups?" But you don't. Other studies also suggested that Chippendale is wrong. In Israel, the Israeli Defense Force had a high suicide rate that dropped by 40 percent once the troops were prohibited from taking their guns with them when they went home for the weekend. In Great Britain, where putting your head in the oven was once a common way to kill yourself, the suicide rate dropped by a third when the country started using a less-toxic form of natural gas. In Sri Lanka, where the preferred method of suicide was poisoning with pesticide, the rate dropped by half once the country switched in 1995 to pesticides that are less toxic to humans. If Chippendale were correct, the suicide rate in those countries wouldn’t have gone down because these were people intent on suicide, Barber said. Said David N. Miller, a professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Albany and and president-elect of the American Association of Suicidology: "Restricting the means of suicide in one area (for example, restricting access to guns) does not inevitably lead to an increase in suicide by other methods, as the politician suggests. In fact, this often does not occur." Our ruling State Rep. Michael Chippendale said, "If an individual is under enough emotional or psychological distress where they’re going to commit suicide, the availability of a gun is not a factor." There is evidence that such substitution takes place, but it is limited and contradicted by other data. Most experts told us the real issue is impulsiveness. Some people determined to kill themselves are locked into that decision and will find another method if a gun isn't handy. But research suggests that most suicide attempts are not the result of such premeditation. Their determination is spur-of-the-moment. Thus, the presence or absence of a firearm can play a big role in whether the person is successful. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05231	Massachusetts under Gov. Mitt Romney initially ranked last among states in job growth, but by the end of his governorship, "we were in the middle of the pack."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/05/eric-fehrnstrom/mitt-romney-campaign-says-job-growth-massachusetts/	Both presidential campaigns are using job statistics to attack each other. President Barack Obama and his allies have spent months criticizing Mitt Romney’s job-creation record as governor of Massachusetts. Now, Romney and his surrogates are arguing that job creation in Massachusetts actually improved on Romney’s watch. So who’s right? We’ll start by looking at a claim that senior Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom made on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos on June 3, 2012. "If you throw D.C. into the mix," Fehrnstrom said, "we were 51 out of 51 (in job creation). By the time Mitt Romney left four years later, we were in the middle of the pack. We were 30th in the nation in terms of job growth. That's the trend line that you want to see." We are separately checking a competing claim made by top Obama adviser David Axelrod on CBS’ Face the Nation. Axelrod said Massachusetts ranked 47th in job creation during Romney’s tenure as governor. For this fact-check, we'll follow our usual approach of looking at the claim in two parts: first, are the numbers correct, and second, how much is the change because of Romney's policies? First, we confirmed the Romney camp’s methodology, which relied on state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data. The Romney campaign used figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted, as tracked by the government’s payroll survey. And because the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, the campaign used the data for December of each year as a baseline. According to a spokesman, the Romney campaign calculated the yearly percentage increase or decrease in job growth for each of Romney’s four years in office. So from December 2002 to December 2003, the job growth in Massachusetts was 51st highest nationally out of 50 states plus the District of Columbia -- in other words, dead last. The following year, it was 46th, then 40th, then in Romney’s final year in office -- December 2005 to December 2006 -- it was 30th in the nation. Looking at the statistics in this way advances the Romney camp’s argument that, while Massachusetts’ overall job growth under Romney was among the lowest of any state, the trendline over time puts his tenure in a more favorable light. A state that was a doormat in job growth at the beginning of his tenure rose into the broad middle of the rankings by the end of it. We did our own math and found the exact same results as the Romney camp. So we agree that the numbers back up Fehrnstrom’s general argument that job growth rates in the state improved over the course of Romney’s governorship relative to other states. But does Romney deserve credit for the job growth? This is an issue we've addressed often at PolitiFact with governors from many states. Economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy. Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state, warned us when we first looked at Axelrod’s 47th-in-the-nation claim in June 2011 not to put to much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Our rating The Romney camp’s year-by-year numbers are correct: Job growth was sluggish early in Romney’s gubernatorial term, and then less so by the time he was ready to leave office. However, Romney -- like the Obama campaign before it -- is exaggerating Romney’s influence on the state job market. Governors simply don't have that much impact. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Eric Fehrnstrom	None	None	None	2012-06-05T18:22:02	2012-06-03	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']

pomt-03643	"Science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/may/02/wayne-smith/wayne-smith-says-science-has-not-shown-greenhouse-/	Wayne Smith does not sweat greenhouse gases. "Science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem," the Republican Baytown state representative told the Austin American-Statesman for a news article posted online April 17, 2013. Smith, who seeks legislative approval of a proposal to have the state issue permits for such industrial emissions, also said that nevertheless, "there’s no need to regulate greenhouse gases." House members sent his proposal to the Senate that week. We explored whether science has not shown greenhouse gases--meaning various gaseous compounds (such as carbon dioxide) that absorb infrared radiation, trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect--to be a problem. Smith, who represents a district that is home to petrochemical plants, did not respond to telephone inquiries, but we ran his claim by Paul C. "Chip" Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, which might be philosophically compatible with the Texan. By phone, Knappenberger said the effects of greenhouse gases on climate change are scientifically proven. But whether that’s a problem, he said, is "open-ended. If you define all change as a problem, then you have a problem. How much of a problem it is depends on how fast and how large the climate change is that results." Knappenberger also pointed out articles he wrote in February and March 2013 suggesting fresh research indicates the generally predicted pace of warming may be overstated. "I am not convinced that the pace of global warming is sufficient enough to make greenhouse gas emissions a ‘problem,’" Knappenberger emailed. Separately, several experts including the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, told us the scientific consensus is that increases in greenhouse gases, mostly due to burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil, have been contributing to global warming, though the pace of that warming is uncertain. Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter says: "Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate." However, "to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change. " "There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position," the chapter later says, "but their number is very, very small." By phone, Nielsen-Gammon said a helpful indicator of the scientific consensus is the latest assessment of global warming factors, published in 2007 by the International Panel on Climate Change. That body was created in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environmental Programme to evaluate the state of climate science as a basis for informed policy action, primarily on the basis of peer-reviewed and published scientific literature, Oreskes has noted. The 2007 report says both that evidence of global warming is "unequivocal" and that most "of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations." In the United States by itself, Nielsen-Gammon pointed out, the National Research Council, which is among a few independent, nonprofit U.S. institutions that provide science, technology, and health policy advice under a congressional charter, issued an analysis in May 2011. A press release summarizing that work opens: "Warning that the risk of dangerous climate change impacts is growing with every ton of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, a" council "committee today reiterated the pressing need for substantial action to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare to adapt to its impacts." Separately, an online search led us to a survey of scientists, published in 2009, that initially asked more than 10,000 earth scientists to participate. Among 3,146 respondents asked if they think "human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures," 82 percent answered affirmatively, with 97 pecent of those respondents with the most climate expertise saying yes. The article, whose lead author was Peter T. Doran, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, closes: "It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes. The challenge, rather, appears to be how to effectively communicate this fact to policy makers and to a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists." Similarly, Oreskes said by email, the National Academy of Sciences published the results of a survey of about 900 "actively publishing" climate scientists in 2010, finding that 97 percent of the scientists agreed with the "tenets of anthropogenic climate change," meaning human contributions to warming. Oreskes told us by email: "The conclusion that humans have contributed to global warming cannot be separated from the role of greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels. To separate human activities from greenhouse gases is a false dichotomy. Increased greenhouse gases are a direct result of human activities, mainly burning fossil fuels. The scientific conclusion is that ‘most’ of the observed warming of the past 50 years is very likely to be due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, caused by burning fossil fuels. Most of the rest has been caused by deforestation. Both are human activities, and both are a problem, because they drive adverse impacts like heat waves and droughts." A speculation: Perhaps Smith concedes that greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, but maintains that warming itself is not a problem. Besides, should his claim be laid aside because any definition of "problem" invokes personal judgment? Scientists see that point, but... Oreskes said by email: "Of course, the word ‘problem’ is subjective, but insofar as one can say that there is evidence that bears on the issue, the scientific community has amply supplied that evidence." By telephone and email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, said she considers greenhouse gases a very expensive problem because western civilization has been built on the premise of a stable climate. Burning fossil fuels, she said, has fed the greenhouse effect. Our ruling Smith said science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem. But scientists have agreed for years that such gases contribute to atmospheric changes driving climatic warming, which is characterized as a global threat. We considered the idea that the legislator’s reference to greenhouse gases as a "problem" reflects an uncheckable judgment, a matter of opinion. However, our sense is that his statement purported to reflect scientific consensus--and by that yardstick, it is both incorrect and ridiculous. We rate the claim as Pants on Fire.

pomt-11634	"Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/18/donald-trump/trump-said-chrysler-leaving-mexico-it-isnt/	Several automakers have unveiled hefty plans to expand in the United States in recent weeks. Toyota and Mazda teamed up to open a $1.6 billion factory in Alabama by 2021. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced it would put $1 billion into its Warren, Mich., factory to make heavy duty versions of its profitable Ram pickup trucks. Speaking at women’s event in Washington, President Donald Trump pointed to this good news as proof of his policies. "We’re making incredible progress," he said Jan. 16. "Toyota is now moving back. Mexico — it’s very interesting — Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan. You haven’t heard that one in a while." In this fact-check, we looked at whether Chrysler is leaving Mexico and returning to Michigan. To cut to the chase, Chrysler is shifting truck production to the United States, but not at the expense of jobs or plants in Mexico. From Saltillo to Warren Saltillo, Mexico, is a nexus of Fiat Chrysler production. It has five plants in the area, doing everything from building engines to assembling finished vehicles. Over 4,000 workers at its truck assembly plant turn out several variations of the Ram truck line. On Jan. 11, the company said that truck production was headed to Warren, Mich., in 2020. "To support the increased volume at the Warren facility, 2,500 new jobs will be created," the company said in a news release. And what would happen at the Saltillo truck plant? It would be "repurposed to produce future commercial vehicles for global distribution," the release said. The company’s spokesman in Mexico, Miguel Ceballos, told reporters – and the company’s American press office confirmed – that the automaker expected no change in the number of Mexican workers. So under the plan, the United States gains workers and Mexico holds steady. Kristen Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research, a government-and-industry-financed research group in Ann Arbor, Mich., told us the move doesn’t mean Fiat Chrysler is leaving Mexico. "The plant in Mexico stays open," Dziczek said. "Chrysler has a very profitable truck product and only two plants in the United States where it makes them. This allows them to retool while keeping production rolling so they can avoid down time." The move is part of Fiat Chrysler’s longer term shift away from making cars to making trucks and SUVs in the United States. In 2016, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne told investors, "By the time we finish with this, hopefully, all of our production assets in the United States will be producing either Jeeps or Ram." The company’s press office said over 90 percent of Ram trucks are sold in America. Industry experts note that trucks are more profitable to Fiat Chrysler than cars. The last 200 model, a passenger car, rolled off the assembly line at Fiat Chrysler’s Sterling Heights, Mich., plant in 2016. Soon after, the company announced that facility, not far from the Warren plant, would start making Ram trucks. Marchionne credited the recent tax bill for spurring the latest move. He also argued it was the "right thing to do" given that Ram trucks had always been made in the United States. But concerns over the fate of NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, might well have played a role too. Under NAFTA, pickup trucks made in Mexico face no tariff when they cross the border. If NAFTA is scuttled, the tariff would shoot up to 25 percent. Dziczek noted that moving truck assembly to the United States is a hedge against that risk. "If you’re going to put a billion dollars down, why would you put it into a plant that’s on the wrong side of the border?" she said. Our ruling Trump said that Chrysler is leaving Mexico and moving back to Michigan. The company does plan to spend $1 billion to shift production of Ram trucks from Saltillo, Mexico, to Warren, Mich. However, this is no zero-sum game where a U.S. gain is Mexico’s loss. The Mexican plant will start making another kind of vehicle, and the company expects no change in the number of workers. There is no question though that the company’s billion dollar investment will add many new jobs in Michigan where Chrysler has long had a presence. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04001	"When total Sandy spending is added up, it's more than the annual budget for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. And it's more than twice the annual budget of the U.S. Energy Department."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/feb/08/kelly-ayotte/sandy-relief-spending-too-liberal-and-costly-says-/	U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte sees a lot of pork in the Hurricane Sandy relief bill, which became law Jan. 28. And, to hear her tell it, there isn’t enough dough around to support it. Ayotte, New Hampshire’s junior senator, voted against the bill last month, citing the amount of non-emergency funding included in the proposal for other projects. "When total Sandy spending is added up, it's more than the annual budget for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. And it's more than twice the annual budget of the U.S. Energy Department," Ayotte wrote Wednesday in an opinion piece, explaining her vote in a piece titled "Sandy Relief Bill Became an Excuse for Spending Spree." "Without question we should help Hurricane Sandy victims with emergency relief legislation," she wrote. "But the days of using a crisis to pass bloated bills stuffed with non-emergency spending further burying us in debt must end." Throughout her column, Ayotte targeted the Sandy relief bill for including billions in non-emergency spending, like $2 million for roof repairs at the Smithsonian in Washington, $4 million for the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, $50 million for the National Park Service and $16 billion that can be used in 47 states for past and future events from 2011 through 2013. But, for this analysis, we’re going to focus on the total Sandy spending that Ayotte cited. Ayotte pegged total Sandy spending at roughly $60 billion, which includes the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act and H.R. 41, a bill that passed Congress earlier in the month. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, which passed the House and the Senate in January on the way to the president’s desk, contains two levels of funding. One level, known as "outlays," is expected to reach $49.2 billion between 2013-2021, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. The other is "budget authority," the total spending allowed by Congress, which would cap at $50.5 billion during that time, according to the CBO. Meanwhile, H.R. 41 added $9.7 billion to the national flood insurance fund. Combined, this sets the total Sandy spending between $58.9 and $60.2 billion. So, Ayotte’s total figure is accurate. Now, let’s compare those totals to the Homeland Security and Energy budgets. The Homeland Security budget can be looked at three ways: $60.4 billion in outlays in Fiscal Year 2012, (White House records) $47.7 billion in budget authority for FY 2012 (White House) $47.4 billion in actual spending for FY 2012 (Treasury records) To review, Ayotte claimed the $60.2 billion in Sandy Relief was more than the Department of Homeland Security’s annual budget. By two measures she’s right and by the third, she’s very, very close. Ayotte’s office said she was referring to the federal budget authority figures when she made the statement. Those typically reflect the total amount that can be spent in a given year. But several economists, considered both liberal and conservative, suggested that outlays, which can sometimes be higher than budget authority figures, are the better measure because they show how much actually will be spent in a given year. "In general, outlays are a better measure because they tell you how much the Congressional Budget Office (the official scorekeeper for Congress) says will actually go out the door in a given year," Ron Haskins, a senior economic fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in an email to The Telegraph. Now, moving on to the energy department, which has a similar budget breakdown. $39 billion in outlays for Fiscal Year 2012 (White House) $22.8 billion in budget authority for FY 2012 (White House) $32.5 billion in actual spending for FY 2012 (Treasury) Ayotte said Sandy relief spending was more than twice the energy department’s budget. When the department’s figures are multiplied by two, she’s correct only when looking at the budget authority figure. It’s also worth noting that Ayotte chose to compare Sandy relief spending, which will be spread over the next eight years, to the annual department budgets, which reflect only one year of spending. Our ruling: Ayotte may have strong feelings about the spending levels included in the Sandy relief bills, but in this case, the numbers don’t always add up the way Ayotte would like. Looking at the Homeland Security department, the FY2012 budget ($60.4 billion) is roughly equal to the Sandy total ($60.2 billion), and both the budget authority ($47.7 billion) and the actual amount spent ($47.4 billion) are less, so Ayotte is right in that regard. But, the Energy budget tells a different story. In 2012, department officials operated on a budget authority of $22.8 billion -- less than half the Sandy total. But, they also estimated $39 billion in department outlays, and records show they ended up spending $32.5 billion. Doubled, both of those numbers exceed the Sandy spending, meaning on this part, Ayotte is off target. Ayotte said she was referring to budget authority figures, and she's right on that count. By other measures, she's either very close or not accurate. We rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Kelly Ayotte	None	None	None	2013-02-08T10:45:41	2013-02-03	['United_States_Department_of_Energy']

pomt-12699	"The number of individuals who actually got coverage through the exchange who didn't have coverage before, or who weren't eligible for Medicaid before is relatively small. So we've turned things upside down completely for 3 million, or 4 million, or 5 million individuals."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/12/tom-price/tom-price-undercounts-obamacare-impact-getting-mor/	Republicans supporting the House GOP’s effort to repeal and replace Obamacare are pushing back on criticism that the plan would strip health insurance away from an estimated 6 million to 15 million Americans. In comments on the Sunday shows March 12, surrogates for President Donald Trump drew a distinction between being insured and being able to access affordable health care. Health and Human Services secretary Tom Price also made the case that the number of new people insured as a result of Obamacare can be overstated. "The number of individuals who actually got coverage through the exchange who didn't have coverage before, or who weren't eligible for Medicaid before is relatively small," Price said on Meet the Press. "So we've turned things upside down completely for 3 million, or 4 million, or 5 million individuals." Is that correct? The passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, did result in a spate of Medicaid enrollees who were previously eligible for the program (about 3.2 million). But beyond that, Price’s claim falls apart. 3 million to 5 million new enrollees? No Price focused on two pools of people -- those who benefited from the plan to expand Medicaid and uninsured Americans who purchased coverage through a federal or state exchange or marketplace. Through that lens, Price’s figures are off. Nonpartisan health care analysts at the Kaiser Family Foundation have concluded that, as of March 2016, more than 11 million Americans have gained access to health care as part of the Medicaid expansion. As we noted, an additional 3.2 million Americans signed up for Medicaid but were previously eligible. Finding data on the number of previously uninsured people who signed up for care through a health care exchange is more challenging. But the numbers that do exist further undercut Price. In 2015, researchers at the nonpartisan RAND Corporation estimated that 4.1 million previously uninsured Americans had gained access through a health care exchange or marketplace. That’s roughly 15 million Americans who weren’t insured who now are, which is three to five times the number Price used. Sherry A. Glied, dean of the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service at New York University, recently examined how much of a factor the Affordable Care Act is playing in cutting the uninsured rate. Looking at the Affordable Care Act’s first open enrollment period (2013-14), Glied concluded that the health care law explained about 76 percent of the decline in the uninsured rate. Glied told us that translates to 9.8 million more people covered as a result of the health care law’s policies in 2014. "Since then, the uninsurance rate has dropped further," Glied said, which would mean the pool of people covered because of Affordable Care Act policies has grown. That Medicaid expansion figure could be bigger It’s important to note that the health care law actually was designed so that even more people would receive health care through the Medicaid expansion. Historically, Medicaid coverage had been focused primarily on pregnant women, children and the disabled. Under the Affordable Care Act, eligibility was to be expanded to nearly all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As part of the law, the federal government agreed to cover 100 percent of the cost of newly eligible people through 2016, 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019, and 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. The original plan was that every state would expand the program, but a 2012 Supreme Court decision allowed each state to decide for itself. To date, 19 states have refused to expand Medicaid eligibility -- creating a gap in coverage. How big is the gap? Kaiser estimates an additional 2.5 million people were intended to get health care as part of the Affordable Care Act but have not. What Price didn’t mention about the ACA The Affordable Care Act included another provision to cover people who previously might be uninsured. The Department of Health and Human Services estimated in 2016 that 2.3 million young adults gained health care from 2010 to October 2013 as a result of a provision of the law that allows people under age 26 to stay on a parent’s plan. The House GOP proposal retains that specific provision. Our ruling Price said, "The number of individuals who actually got coverage through the exchange who didn't have coverage before, or who weren't eligible for Medicaid before is relatively small. So we've turned things upside down completely for 3 million, or 4 million, or 5 million individuals." Price is understating the impact of the law on providing health insurance to the previously uninsured. The proposal to expand Medicaid alone has provided health insurance to more than 11 million Americans. We rate this statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com UPDATE March 12, 4:30 p.m. ET: A spokesman for Price's office responded after we published this item and cited the RAND study we referenced, as well as others, that look at the number of previously uninsured people who purchased insurance through the marketplace.

pomt-08086	"Already, the mayor of Green Bay is having ribbon-cutting after ribbon-cutting for economic development around the new VA center."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/16/steve-kagen/us-rep-steve-kagen-says-new-veterans-clinic-has-al/	Voters in northeastern Wisconsin showed two-term U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen the door in November. The Democrat from Appleton is now -- like many other congressional lame ducks -- working in a basement office at the Capitol while his old digs are readied for a new member of the House. As he wound down his time in D.C., Kagen took time out for a long interview published Dec. 13, 2010 in the Green Bay Press Gazette, where he discussed his accomplishments and waxed philosophic about his loss to Republican Reid Ribble. Kagen said he’s committed to maintaining services to the citizens of the 8th District, and said he was proud of his time in Congress. He strongly supported health care reform legislation, and touted his work on behalf of the paper industry and support of Marinette Marine’s bid for a huge contract for a new class of littoral ships for the Navy. The congressman also mentioned a new Veterans Administration clinic coming to Green Bay. "Already, the mayor of Green Bay is having ribbon-cutting after ribbon-cutting for economic development around the new VA center," Kagen told the Press Gazette. "It'll have a huge footprint and bring in millions of dollars of revenue to the entire county and the city of Green Bay." An achievement, to be sure. One problem: The clinic itself is a ways off. Asked whether he’s cut any ribbons in that part of the city lately, Green Bay Mayor James J. Schmitt barely suppressed a laugh: "I have not." Indeed, officials haven’t even broken ground on the veterans facility itself, let alone related spinoff projects. Let’s take a step back. The VA has planned for years -- before Kagen was in office -- to build a new clinic that will be named after Milo C. Huempfner, a local World War II hero. The $60 million facility will be built on the east side of the city, not far from the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. Some 20,000 area veterans will be served by the outpatient clinic, which will have some 300 employees. An added boost: The facility is on the local tax rolls. Schmitt and Derek Lord, Green Bay’s economic development director, said the city has high hopes for the area surrounding the clinic site. For instance, the two said other medical offices, restaurants and a hotel are among the businesses that one day would want to be near the new VA facility. But that’s one day. As it stands, a contractor has not yet been hired to build the clinic and groundbreaking won’t take place until April. Lord said the city has heard from some developers who might be interested in area projects -- but in a very preliminary sense. Said Lord: "We anticipate a lot of activity, but we don’t anticipate that until the clinic is completed -- or near completion -- in the summer of 2013." So don’t expect Mayor Schmitt to take down those fancy three-and-a-half foot-long shears from their spot on display in Lord’s office -- not just yet, anyway. "They actually cut the ribbon," Lord said, adding "they’re the real thing." We called Kagen’s office to ask him about his statement about all the development. His office phone has a greeting from Kagen himself. But the answering machine was full, and a press aide didn’t respond to a telephone message on her cell phone. The congressman’s Web site includes a press release from 2009 noting that "Kagen and the Veterans Administration moved the request for the expanded Ambulatory Surgery/Outpatient Diagnostic Center and Community Based Outpatient Clinic from FY 2010 to FY 2009. The VA center will increase the total square feet available from 12,000 to over 160,000." So the congressman apparently helped increase the size of the facility and get it built earlier. But it’s not built yet -- and the related development was the central part of his boast. So here’s where we stand. Right now, the new VA clinic is an undeveloped, vacant parcel. The golden shovel for the groundbreaking and the special ribbon-cutting shears are ready for action. But once started, completion of the center is years away. And so, too, it seems, is the related economic development Kagen is already boasting about. The Green Bay officials say they appreciated Kagen’s help on the project, but said he got it wrong about the repeated ribbon cuttings. We agree. Way wrong. Pants on Fire.

"Democrat Congressmen Pelosi and Keith Olbermann introduced H.B. 2169-B, which would remove the requirement that the President be born here," said a Sept. 18 post on Americannews88.com. Several problems appeared right off of the bat. The post presumably refers to House Minority Leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, but Keith Olbermann is a political commentator, not a congressman. Also, bills originating in the House of Representatives are identified as "H.R." not "H.B." No such H.B. 2169-B bill has been introduced. A House bill bearing the numbers 2169 was introduced in April 2017 by Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., but it has nothing to do with removing the U.S. citizenship requirement to become U.S. president. That bill introduced by a Republican lawmaker seeks to improve information sharing among local and federal entities. The fake news post claims Pelosi issued a statement saying her bill would allow someone to run for president if they have lived in the United States for two years. "Asked if this would allow a foreign power to effectively take over the country or encourage terrorism, Pelosi explained that it would not because ‘the embrace of the American people would be enough to ensure that the person does their very best,’ " said Americannews88.com’s post. The website quotes "Rep.Olbermann" making the argument that if people from other countries come to the United States to run corporations, "‘Why can’t we do that with the government? We can’t do worse than Trump’." Americannews88.com does not have any identifying information noting who’s behind it, its purpose or mission. Its Sept. 18 post also appears on TheLastLineofDefense.org, a website that says everything on it "is a satirical work of fiction."

pomt-04248	Says 40 years ago, the U.S. placed Texas under Voting Rights Act for failing to print ballots in Spanish.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/nov/16/terral-smith/terral-smith-says-40-years-ago-us-placed-texas-und/	Texas carries a legal burden that most other states don’t, an Austin lawyer says, because of how its ballots appeared in the 1970s. "About 40 years ago, the federal government placed Texas under the Voting Rights Act because Texas failed to print ballots in both English and Spanish," wrote Terral Smith, a former Republican member of the Texas House, in an opinion column for the Sept. 9, 2012, Austin American-Statesman. Most states under Section 5 of the act are there because of their history of discrimination against black voters. The Justice Department’s website says Congress passed the law "at the height of the civil rights movement in the South, a movement committed to securing equal voting rights for African Americans." It’s far from being old news, though. Texas is contesting two high-profile applications of the act, and the Supreme Court agreed Nov. 9, 2012, to rule on an Alabama case challenging Section 5’s constitutionality. We decided to look at the history. The landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, which has been renewed and amended over the years, took aim at several methods being used to prevent African Americans from voting. These included literacy tests that white election officials could administer as they saw fit, the Justice Department site says. Though the 15th Amendment made such practices illegal in 1870, in reality they were widespread. The 1965 act specified that no "tests or devices" could be placed between citizens and their ballots, spelling out examples such as the literacy tests and providing for oversight by "examiners" and the U.S. attorney general. Section 5 required that certain jurisdictions -- states or smaller political entities that had recently employed such methods and had less than 50 percent voter participation or registration in the last presidential election -- must get federal preclearance for any changes in their election laws. The same day that President Lyndon Johnson signed the act, according to a November 1965 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, seven states and parts of two others were flagged by the U.S. Census Bureau and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach because they had used literacy tests and fell below the halfway mark in voter registration/participation. Texas had never put a literacy test into its laws, according to the online education Texas Politics project at the University of Texas. Katzenbach told the Rotary Club of Houston in a Sept. 30, 1965, address, "Voting discrimination is of general national concern, but it is not, by and large, a problem here. The use of federal examiners in Texas is neither needed nor contemplated." So how did Texas get on the list? Smith told us he drew his information from a ruling in one of the state’s current voting rights battles over election changes that were denied preclearance: the 2011 maps drawn for Texas’ congressional and state legislative districts and the 2011 Texas law requiring voters to show government-issued photo ID. In the voter ID case, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued an Aug. 30, 2012, ruling which, in its historical background, said the 1965 act’s preclearance criteria were drawn up carefully to net the Southern states with the worst history of discrimination. "In 1975," it said, "Congress expanded the coverage formula to include jurisdictions that had substantial non-English-speaking populations but provided English-only voting materials at the polls. "It was this change that brought Texas within the scope of Section 5’s coverage." And it was proposed by a Texan: U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, D-Houston, the first black congresswoman elected from the South. According to a Congressional Research Service history of the act, the final form of the legislation in 1975 said that a jurisdiction would be subject to preclearance if it had low voter turnout/registration and also met both of these qualifications: 5 percent or more of its population spoke a language other than English, as determined by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the jurisdiction had conducted its Nov. 1, 1972 elections solely in English. If that group of non-English speakers also had lower-than-average literacy in English, the jurisdiction would have to conduct bilingual elections, including ballots in both languages. Other states were affected, and Spanish was not the only language involved. Alaska and Arizona in their entirety, plus individual counties in California, New York and elsewhere, were now covered. As the U.S. population evolves and the act is amended or reconstrued, these continue to change; Houston’s Harris County, for example, was required to provide election materials in Vietnamese as of 2004. The Census Bureau annually publishes a list of the jurisdictions falling afoul of the language requirements. So that’s what the 1975 amendment did. To learn whether Texas was drawn in because it didn’t print ballots in English and Spanish, we sought the motivation behind the amendment -- and heard a range of reasons. Former Texas Gov. Mark White, who in 1975 was Texas’ secretary of state, told us by phone, "It was all done to capture Texas." National advocacy groups such as the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund wanted to maximize Hispanic voters’ power, he said. White argued the case for Texas in December 1975 when the state sued claiming it had improperly been subjected to Section 5. "We passed in 1975 a Texas voting rights act which was stronger than the federal act," he said. "I think we did everything we could do to let everybody in America know that Texas was not part of the Old South, which would exclude minorities from voting." MALDEF’s vice president for litigation, Nina Perales, told us by email that Congress reached its decision after much testimony about discrimination against non-English speakers. The testimony, some from MALDEF, described a range of discrimination, Perales said: refusing to register voters, throwing away their ballots, intimidation and harassment that included firing Spanish-speaking employees who got involved in politics. On a broader scale, districts were redrawn or positions elected at-large to prevent Spanish speakers from winning office, she said. One view we came across several times in our research was that Texas only escaped the preclearance terms in 1965 by the grace of Texas native President Lyndon Johnson, at whose direction the act was drafted. University of Houston political science professor Richard Murray has voiced this view: "It is not surprising that LBJ left his home state off the ‘bad conduct’ list," Murray wrote in a June 26, 2009, blog post for Houston’s KTRK-TV. By 1975, he wrote, U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas was eyeing a White House run and was persuaded by Jordan that extending the act to Texas and to Hispanic voters would earn him needed support from liberal and minority voters. The archivist of Jordan’s papers at Texas Southern University, Gary Chaffee, emailed us documents from a May 2011 exhibit he put together focusing on Jordan’s Voting Rights Act work. In a Feb. 26, 1975, press release headlined "Representative Barbara Jordan Asks Congress to Extend Voting Rights Act to Texas," Jordan said: "I know firsthand the difficulty minorities have in participating in the political process as equals. The same discriminatory practices which moved the Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965, and renew it in 1970, are practiced in Texas today." Separately, we found Jordan’s Feb. 26, 1975, statement introducing the bill in a Congressional subcommittee hearing, in which she described instances of voter intimidation and harassment as well as language barriers. Bilingual ballots wouldn’t fix everything, she said, but they were a start -- and offered a clear way to measure discrimination: "Printing of Spanish registration forms and Spanish baIlots will not cure voting discrimination in the Southwest. I have incorporated the use of an English-only ballot as a ‘test or device’ because it is a readily identifiable, objective criterion the Justice Department can easily apply nationally." Ultimately, was Texas brought under the act because it failed to print Spanish ballots? White and Perales both told us that was not entirely accurate because of the 1975 amendment’s three preclearance "triggers": 5 percent non-English speakers, less than 50 percent turnout/registration and failure to print bilingual ballots. Our ruling Smith said that "about 40 years ago, the federal government placed Texas under the Voting Rights Act because Texas failed to print ballots in both English and Spanish." The amendment made 37 years ago was intended to -- and did -- bring Texas elections under the Voting Rights Act. English-only ballots were a "trigger" alongside other conditions. We rate Smith’s statement as Half True.	None	Terral Smith	None	None	None	2012-11-16T12:48:33	2012-09-09	['United_States', 'Texas', 'Spain']
pomt-13140	Says "Catherine Cortez Masto indicted (Brian Krolicki), who was an innocent man, in order to save Harry Reid's political career"	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/nov/01/joe-heck/new-ad-claiming-catherine-cortez-masto-indicted-ha/	Catherine Cortez Masto’s record as Nevada’s attorney general is yet again under fire in the waning days of Nevada’s highly competitive U.S. Senate race. A new ad from Republican Rep. Joe Heck’s campaign features the 18-year-old daughter of former Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki claiming that Cortez Masto "was willing to hurt me and my sisters and my family" by trying to prosecute her father during her time as the state’s attorney general. "Catherine Cortez Masto indicted my father, who was an innocent man, in order to save Harry Reid's political career," she says in the ad. Cortez Masto’s decision to pursue felony charges against Krolicki has long been used as a prime example of her close relationship with senior Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, as the charges came only a few weeks after Krolicki began exploring a run against Reid in 2010. The case against Krolicki was thrown out before it went to trial, so he’s technically innocent in the eyes of the law. But the decision to indict didn’t appear out of thin air, as the Republican had previously been the target of a probe into possible financial mismanagement of a state-run program. An audit and an indictment The charges stem from a 2007 audit of a state college savings program overseen by Krolicki during his time as the state treasurer (a partisan, elected position in Nevada) and alleging that he mismanaged the program’s finances. The audit found the $3.3 billion program, which gives parents options for tax-free investments toward future college costs, failed to follow standard state budgeting procedures and that more than $6 million in collected fees wasn’t being deposited into official accounts and were instead directly allocated toward other program costs. This so-called "off-line budgeting" was used for a variety of purposes, including nearly $1 million in legal fees and $1.5 million for an advertising campaign for the program featuring Krolicki as the program’s spokesman — meaning the office substantially overspent the budget approved by state lawmakers. The audit accounted for all of the money collected and spent by the program, and Krolicki was never accused of pocketing the money or otherwise enriching himself (though the indictment said he benefited politically from appearing in advertising). Krolicki, for his part, denied any wrongdoing (telling a reporter "I sleep very well at night") and characterized the audit as a struggle between the legislative and executive branches of state government, saying he relied on advice from public and private counsel and even clearing the disputed contracts with the attorney general’s office. "In my view, he hadn’t done anything wrong," Scott Scherer, Krolicki’s attorney at the time, told PolitiFact. "This was merely a dispute over process." Former Democratic Assemblywoman Chris Giunchigliani, who testified as a witness during the grand jury hearing on Krolicki, told PolitiFact that Krolicki likely violated the state’s budget act by going around state lawmakers and having no legislative oversight on the program’s spending. "I felt it was a maneuver to go around what the legislature budgeted," she said. "Why would you even call a grand jury if it wasn’t something inappropriate?" Cortez Masto’s office sought and obtained a grand jury indictment against Krolicki and his chief of staff Kathy Besser on felony charges related to the audit in December 2008. Krolicki actually broke the news himself, holding an hour-long press conference days before the indictment came out and decrying Cortez Masto as engaged in a "partisan witch hunt." The Republican pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the case quickly turned into a fight over whether or not the Attorney General’s office had a conflict of interest in prosecuting a fellow state official to whom her office and previously provided legal counsel, including on contracts related to the College Savings program. Cortez Masto was forced to seek an expensive special prosecutor for the case after a judge disqualified her office due to a "conflict of interest" and district attorneys in Reno and Las Vegas declined to take up the case. Ultimately, a judge dismissed the indictment "without prejudice" after finding it to be overly vague and lacking detail. Krolicki immediately declared himself vindicated while Cortez Masto later told reporters that he got off on a technicality, though declining to appeal the decision or present it to another grand jury. So is it fair to describe Krolicki as innocent? Because the case never went to trial and was dismissed for reasons other than the actual merits of the case, Krolicki is innocent in the eyes of the law. But other commentators have pointed out that although the Republican declared himself vindicated immediately following the court’s decision, no court or jury ever ruled on whether or not Krolicki actually violated state law. "It left the AG’s office hanging and it left Brian (Krolicki) hanging because the ultimate question was never answered," Giunchigliani said. Do "all roads" lead to Reid? It’s much more difficult to blame Reid for the case being brought forward. From the beginning, Krolicki sought to cast the indictment as a "witch hunt" born of "partisan malice" and immediately brought up the longtime Nevada senator’s name as a possible instigator. "All Democratic partisan roads lead to Harry Reid," he said at the time. "Reid has a long reach across the country." The indictment did come just a few weeks after Krolicki publicly began exploring a run to unseat Reid, but Cortez Masto fervently denied any communication or influence from Reid, as did the senior Nevada senator. And auditors actually started digging into the case in 2007, after Krolicki’s successor in the treasurer’s office asked for a third-party audit into "irregularities" in how the program’s money was being managed — long before Krolicki announced his desire to challenge Reid. Krolicki never presented any hard evidence that Reid was involved with the case. Nevada political commentator Jon Ralston opined at the time that even if Reid tried to influence Cortez Masto, the "apolitical and by-the-book" attorney general would have likely ignored him anyways. Krolicki elected not to get involved in the contested Republican Senate primary, and Reid ended up defeating Republican Sharron Angle in the 2010 election by a 50 to 44 percent margin. Richard Wright, Krolicki’s attorney at the time, said he didn’t hold Cortez Masto to blame because the prosecution was driven more by one of her deputies than by the attorney general herself. "It’s like Catherine’s the CEO, the president of the big corporation, and I understand where responsibility goes, but it’s not like she was directing it or had anything to do it," he said. "If there’s any criticism, it would be lack of supervision." Wright said the same prosecutor brought a similar criminal case against former Las Vegas City Councilwoman Janet Moncrief, but that he didn’t hold it against the then-Attorney General and current Gover. Brian Sandoval. Cortez Masto both in 2009 and more recently maintained that she never spoke with Reid about bringing charges against Krolicki and told a PolitiFact Nevada reporter that "we treated (it) just like any other case." The ad also cites a Las Vegas Sun analysis of the case’s fallout on Cortez Masto’s political future, using a text overlay of "Masto ... hyperpartisan" and "prosecutorial misconduct." That’s slightly out of context — those quotes are related more to how the case could be perceived rather than any editorial judgement being passed by the Sun. The full quotes say, "Cortez Masto opened herself to charges of politicizing her office and prosecutorial misconduct" and "appeared to be hyperpartisan." Our ruling A new Heck campaign ad claims Cortez Masto indicted "an innocent man, in order to save Harry Reid's political career." Cortez Masto did pursue felony charges against Krolicki, and the case was thrown out by judge on separate, unrelated charges. The indictment itself was controversial, and it is technically accurate to say Krolicki is innocent. But the ad ignores important context and unresolved issues with his financial management of state’s college savings program under Krolicki. Although the timing of the indictment might have been politically fortuitous for Reid, there’s no public evidence that he was involved with this case. Because this ad leaves out important details but is still partially accurate, we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8e2207a8-da4b-4042-b846-57f9a2b6eca3	None	Joe Heck	None	None	None	2016-11-01T12:08:02	2016-10-25	['Brian_Krolicki', 'Harry_Reid']

pomt-06773	Says Rick Perry flip-flopped on gay marriage by first saying it was a state’s rights issue and then saying he was in favor of a federal constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/19/martin-frost/did-gov-rick-perry-change-position-same-sex-marria/	In a column in POLITICO Aug. 12, 2011, former Texas congressman and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee head Martin Frost argued that Texas Gov. Rick Perry may not be ready for the increased scrutiny of a presidential campaign. "Perry demonstrated that he may not be ready for prime time with how he handled the gay marriage issue. First, Perry said that he didn’t have any problem with states like New York approving gay marriage — though he didn’t think it was appropriate for Texas. It was a state's rights issue," Frost wrote. "However, after getting strong pushback from the religious right community, Perry changed his position, saying he was in favor of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage everywhere. " We'll explore Frost's claim in two parts. Did Perry say it was a states' rights issue? And did he then shift his stance to support an amendment? Frost told us he was out of the country for two weeks and wouldn't be able to provide additional information about his claim. We called and e-mailed Perry's campaign and did not receive a response. State's rights: 'That's New York, and that's their business' Perry addressed the state's rights question when he spoke to a Republican Governors Association forum at the Aspen Institute in Colorado on July 22, 2011. Here's how the Associated Press reported it: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a potential Republican presidential candidate, said Friday he supports state rights so much that he's fine with New York's approval of gay marriage but still called himself an "unapologetic social conservative." Perry, who has been weighing a presidential run, said he opposes gay marriage — but that he's also a firm believer of the 10th Amendment. "Our friends in New York six weeks ago passed a statute that said marriage can be between two people of the same sex. And you know what? That's New York, and that's their business, and that's fine with me," he said to applause from several hundred GOP donors in Aspen, Colo. "That is their call. If you believe in the 10th Amendment, stay out of their business." So Perry was strongly in favor of state's rights. But soon after, social conservatives including former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who is also running for the nomination, attacked Perry for his stance. "So Gov Perry, if a state wanted to allow polygamy, or if they chose to deny heterosexuals the right to marry, would that be OK too?" Santorum tweeted after the speech. Supporting a federal constitutional amendment Six days later, the Texas governor added this explanation in an appearance with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins: "I probably needed to add a few words after that 'it's fine with me,' and that it's fine with me that a state is using their sovereign rights to decide an issue. Obviously gay marriage is not fine with me. My stance hasn't changed," he said. "I believe marriage is a union between one man and one woman." Perry pointed to his efforts to pass a defense of marriage act in Texas. In 2003, Perry signed a bill specifying that Texas does not legally recognize a same-sex marriage or civil union. Two years later, he supported strengthening the law with the Texas Marriage Amendment, defining marriage as the "union of one man and one woman." The amendment was approved by Texas voters in November 2005. During his conversation with Perkins, Perry also endorsed a federal marriage amendment. He said it is being offered out of concern that "activist" judges would impose a different definition of marriage on the states. "Indeed, to not pass the federal marriage amendment would impinge on Texas and other states not to have marriage forced upon us by these activist judges and special interest groups." Was that a shift for Perry? We scoured books and newspaper databases and couldn't find any other comments from him that directly address a federal amendment, although we did find a column from Feb. 19, 2009, in the Austin American-Statesman in which he obliquely addressed it. Speaking of leaders in Washington, he said, "Can you imagine if they built a constitutional firewall around traditional marriage?" That comment implied that he supported such an amendment. Activists on both sides of the issue also told us he was a supporter of such an amendment before his remarks a few weeks ago. Kelly Shackelford, president of the Liberty Institute, which describes itself as "guided by principles that limit government and promote Judeo-Christian values," said that Perry has "been in favor of a federal marriage amendment for a long time." He said Perry favors the federal constitutional amendment because he is concerned that without it, "the courts will take it out of our hands." Shackelford said Perry's position is consistent with his strong support for the 10th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Since a proposed amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states, it provides an opportunity for the states to speak, according to Shackelford. Dennis Coleman, executive director of Equality Texas, which opposes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, also said that Perry has supported a federal constitutional amendment on marriage in the past, as well as the state amendment. "He does believe in states rights," said Coleman, but Perry also holds a position that "it should not be legislated from the bench. It should be decided by the people." After the flap in July, Perry spokesman Mark Miner was quoted in the Austin American-Statesman also affirming that Perry supported a federal constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. "Nothing has changed with the governor's philosophy here," the Statesman quoted him saying. Still, in Perry's discussions of the issue prior to the dust-up over his remarks at the National Governors Association, he has emphasized states' rights rather than support for a constitutional amendment. Here's how his position was summed up in an interview in the April 4, 2011, issue of the conservative National Review: "Here's something you won't hear an up-and-down-the-line conservative like Perry saying all that often: 'If you don't like medical marijuana and gay marriage, don't move to California.' ...Perry is content for Californians to let their freak flags fly, though he confesses that he recoils from some of the implications of his hard-line constitutionalism: The thought of flag-burning, for instance, makes Rick Perry one angry Eagle Scot. But his laissez-faire attitude is surprisingly broad … 'don't make me accept it as normal,' Perry says, 'and do not make me pay for it. But that's classic Tenth Amendment, and I'll fight to the death for California's right to decide for themselves how they want to live.'" The interview contained no mention of the federal constitutional amendment on marriage, although it did quote Perry saying: "I have no problem changing the Constitution from time to time: I want a balanced-budget amendment. There’s a process for that, for amending the Constitution." Perry's 2010 manifesto, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, strongly endorses states' rights but does not discuss a federal constitutional amendment on gay marriage. "If you don't support the death penalty and citizens packing a pistol, don't come to Texas. If you don't like medical marijuana and gay marriage, don't move to California … "I would no more consider living in Massachusetts than I suspect a great number of folks from Massachusetts would like to live in Texas. We just don't agree on a number of things. They passed state-run health care, they have sanctioned gay marriage." Perry does mention his concerns about the courts imposing their views of marriage on states: "Gay marriage will soon be the policy of the United States, irrespective of federalism, the Constitution or the wishes of the American people. Not because it is actually protected in the Constitution, but because judges will declare it so." He does not go on, however, to argue that a federal constitutional amendment is needed to head off this result. He makes no mention of it at all in the section of the book called, "Our Ability to Define Marriage." Nor does he mention such an amendment in his final chapter, "Retaking the Reins of Government: Freedom and Federalism for the Future." He does, however discuss the need to "amend the Constitution -- now -- to restrict federal spending." and the option of repealing the 16th Amendment, which provides for income tax. Our ruling Frost claims that Perry has flip-flopped on the issue and didn't bring up the amendment until a conservative outcry about his states' rights remarks. We find some merit to Frost's claim because Perry did, indeed, bring up his support for the amendment after his remarks about gay marriage in New York stirred up a storm. And we found little evidence that he talked about it much before that. Instead, he emphasized a view that states should decide for themselves. Still, activists on both sides of the issue as well as his spokesman said Perry supported the amendment long before his recent comments. And he has consistently raised a concern that the courts might force acceptance of same sex marriage on states that disapprove, which is his rationale for supporting a federal constitutional amendment. Frost is right that Perry changed in the face of criticism, but the change appears not to have been so much a change in policy as a change in rhetorical emphasis designed to quiet critics. Because Frost said Perry "changed his position," we rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Martin Frost	None	None	None	2011-08-19T11:38:23	2011-08-12	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-11605	"We have right now, … in the state of California, 55 percent of all immigrants are on public assistance."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/jan/29/steve-cortes/are-55-percent-immigrants-california-welfare-s-exa/	Former Trump Hispanic advisory council president Steve Cortes used a questionable statistic to portray Californian immigrants as a drain on government funds. "We have right now, and this is not my talking point, per The L.A. Times, in the state of California, 55 percent of all immigrants are on public assistance," Cortes said on CNN’s Erin Burnett Outfront. "Let's start doing it right," Cortes continued. "Merit based. Control the border, allow the DACA people to stay. There is a reasonable compromise here." Cortes referred us to a Los Angeles Times op-ed, not report, entitled "Why is liberal California the poverty capital of America?" We tracked the statistic back to a September 2015 study from Steven Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low-immigration levels. We’ve previously rated Mostly True the claim that "half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system," also sourced back to this study. Cortes said that 55 percent of immigrants in California benefit from welfare, but the CIS report looks at immigrant households. There’s a distinction here, as immigrant households are defined as being headed by a foreign-born person. The immigrant might not always be receiving the benefit, as with households in which a U.S.-born child qualifies for a benefit, while their undocumented or newly arrived immigrant parent does not. Undocumented immigrants cannot access most services, and a 1996 law restricts immigrants from public benefits during their first five years as a "qualified alien". Westy Egmont, director of the Immigrant Integration Lab at Boston College, added that California’s more generous public assistance system means more people more receive aid than they would in most states. The data comes from the 2012 Survey of Income and Program Participation, the latest and most reliable source of welfare statistics according to George Borjas, an immigration expert at Harvard University. When he ran the 2017 California numbers using the Current Population Survey, he found that 41 percent of immigrant households receive public assistance, whereas 24 percent of native households do. In 2012, 49.5 percent of immigrant and 25.3 percent native households received government assistance in California. Government assistance Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, said the report considers programs most people might not think as government assistance or welfare, including school lunches and Medicaid. School lunch is a nutrition program, and it’s not always means-tested, so some schools in low-income areas provide free or reduced lunches to all students, Capps explained. "Medicaid is health insurance that goes with income eligibility that go way up beyond the poverty level in California," Capps said. "They have workers in these families, so it’s not like it’s an alternative to work, it’s just that they have jobs that don’t carry health care benefits." Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid, so Manuel Pastor, director of USC’s Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration, questioned whether American-born children using Medicaid should be lumped into the category of immigrants receiving welfare. "That’s a key difference, because the policy alternative would be to tell U.S.-born kids who are the children of immigrants that they can’t, for example, access the CHIP program," Pastor said. Removing food assistance and Medicaid from the calculation shrunk the statistic significantly. Doing so showed 16.3 percent of immigrant households received cash benefits while 12.8 percent of native-born households did, and 6.1 percent of native households received public or subsidized housing, while 5.8 percent of immigrant households did. "It would almost certainly reduce the share of households using welfare for both immigrants and natives," Camarota said. "But, by how much I am not sure. Perhaps the rates would be something like 40 percent versus 20 percent." Households v. Immigrants Camarota said he measured households because the income of all persons in a household determines if one can get TANF or SNAP, and other household members benefit if they don’t have to pay for, say, a child’s health insurance. "Examining welfare use by households is, in effect, examining welfare use for immigrants and their kids versus natives and their kids," Camarota said. "The key policy question is, can immigrants support themselves and their children? High welfare use is an indication that they cannot." The report does not correct for income, lumping in high-income native-born and immigrant households. Myungkook Joo and Jeounghee Kim took a closer look and concluded that poor immigrant families use less welfare than poor native families. Our ruling Cortes said, "We have right now … in the state of California, 55 percent of all immigrants are on public assistance." That’s true of households but not individual immigrants, in 2012, a study found. The Current Population Survey found a lower amount, that 41 percent of immigrant households in California relied on welfare. Government assistance is broadly defined to include school lunch and Medicaid. The discrepancy in what may ordinarily be considered welfare, like cash and housing assistance, was much lower between native and immigrant households in California. In the absence of clearer definitions of public assistance and the distinction between immigrants and immigrant households, Cortes’ claim exaggerates immigrants’ drain on public coffers.

pomt-08396	The new health care law will "force seniors into Barack Obama's government-run health care program."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/22/dan-coats/health-care-law-forces-seniors-barack-obamas-gover/	We've fact-checked lots of ads about health care reform and Medicare. But an ad in the Indiana Senate race makes the novel claim that seniors will now be forced into "Barack Obama's government-run health care program." That sounds like a scary prospect -- until you realize that seniors are already in a government-run health care program, Medicare, and have been for 45 years. The law wouldn't force them to join any plan they aren't already in. The ad is from Dan Coats, a Republican attorney and former ambassador to Germany, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Indiana. He has a wide lead against Democratic Rep. Brad Ellsworth. (The seat is now held by Evan Bayh, who announced earlier this year he would not seek re-election.) Here's how the ad goes. "Congressman Brad Ellsworth said he would protect seniors. But when he got to Washington, Congressman Ellsworth voted for the largest cuts in Medicare history - over $500 billion. That's right, Ellsworth voted with Nancy Pelosi to force seniors into Barack Obama's government-run health care program, reducing the protection Medicare provides. That's wrong. Dan Coats will fight to strengthen Medicare and protect seniors." We'll start by noting that the ad gets some things right, starting with the fact that Ellsworth voted for the Democratic health care law. And the law does include reductions in future spending for Medicare. But here, we're checking whether the health care law forces seniors into "Barack Obama's government-run health care program." First, some background about how the law handles Medicare. The $500 billion in cuts is actually a reduction in the future growth of Medicare costs over 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase over that time -- the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. But it won't increase as fast as it would have otherwise. The cost reductions have two aims: to make Medicare more efficient and to help fund coverage for the uninsured. Some of the savings comes from relatively minor changes, such as $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. The law directs a new national board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- to identify $15.5 billion in savings, by recommending improved practices while preserving basic coverage. Congress retains the power to overrule the board's recommendations. More significantly, there's $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program. The program was intended to bring more efficiency from the private sector to the Medicare program, but it hasn't worked as planned. A June 2009 analysis from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission said that the Advantage programs cost taxpayers an average of 14 percent more than the traditional Medicare plan. President Barack Obama has said repeatedly that Medicare Advantage wastes public money that could be put to better use. The health care law that Obama signed in March phases out extra payments for Medicare Advantage programs over the next three to six years to bring their costs in line with traditional Medicare and institutes other rules for the program. Finally, there's $220 billion in Medicare savings achieved by reducing annual increases in payments health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. The reductions are part of programs intended to improve care and make it more efficient, such as reducing payments for preventable hospital re-admissions. These adjustments are aimed at hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies. There's a good deal of debate as to whether these reductions in payments are reasonable or overly ambitious, and only time will tell which side is right. But the law also includes new benefits for Medicare. Those improvements include more coverage for prescription drugs, or "closing the doughnut hole," as its commonly known. The law also funds free preventive care for seniors, so that they don't have to pay for routine check-ups. Finally, the law increases payments to primary care physicians who take Medicare patients. Most of these benefits start in 2011. The ad is nonsensical in two ways. It says that "Ellsworth voted with Nancy Pelosi to force seniors into Barack Obama's government-run health care program." But there's no such requirement in the law. Seniors are not "forced" into a government plan any more than they have been. Also, Medicare is already a government-run health care program. It has been for 45 years, ever since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the law creating it in 1965. Under Medicare, the government pays most of the health care bill for virtually every person over 65 in the United States, even when they see private physicians and visit private hospitals. The government determines what it pays those health care providers, and it sets the rules for what's covered and what's not. Indeed, when liberal supporters of a universal, single-payer health care system make their case, they often describe such a system as "Medicare for all." Obama specifically rejected such a plan during the presidential campaign as too dramatic a change from the current system. The new health care law cannot "force" seniors into a government-run health care program to which they already belong. We asked the Coats campaign about this point, and they said Medicare may have already been a government-run health care program, but it wasn't Barack Obama's government-run health care program until the health care law went into effect. That argument doesn't make sense to us because we don't think that a major government program that's been in place for 45 years becomes a new program when a president passes legislation that affects it. Maybe you could make a case that some people in Medicare Advantage will see their programs changed. But Medicare Advantage programs changed their offerings from year to year before the health care law passed. And if seniors are being forced into regular Medicare, a government-run health care program, it's one they've collectively been forced into for 45 years. Ellsworth's vote did nothing to change that. The ad is capitalizing on confusion about the nature of the Medicare program and making a ridiculous claim. Pants on Fire!	None	Dan Coats	None	None	None	2010-10-22T16:44:18	2010-10-14	['None']

pomt-07638	Gov. Rick Perry "used $3.2 billion in stimulus dollars for schools to plug other holes in his budget."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/mar/16/gail-collins/gail-collins-says-perry-used-32-billion-stimulus-m/	New York Times columnist Gail Collins recently highlighted $830 million in federal education aid for Texas that’s been left dangling in a standoff between Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin. In her Feb. 16 column, Collins notes that U.S. House Democrats from Texas set special conditions that the state must meet to get its share of about $10 billion approved last summer for states to help school districts hire and retain teachers. The Democrats, Collins writes, were "ticked off because Perry used $3.2 billion in stimulus dollars for schools to plug other holes in his budget" in 2009. In Austin, attorney Terral Smith, a former GOP Texas House member who later worked for Gov. George W. Bush, asked us to check Collins’ statement because he doesn’t think it tells "the whole story." Some background: Doggett led last year’s effort setting special hurdles that Texas must clear to get the $830 million. For starters, the money must "supplement and not supplant state" funding, and the governor must assure that the state will not reduce the percentage of its budget going to public education through 2013. The law requires governors of other states to make a similar promise, but only through 2011. And while every other state may decide how to distribute that money to schools, Texas must follow a federal formula that directs more aid to districts serving many students from low-income families. According to Austin American-Statesman news articles, Perry says he cannot make the two-year commitment because appropriating state money is the Legislature’s responsibility, not the governor’s, and the Texas Constitution does not allow a governor to bind legislatures to future spending. The Legislature is currently drafting the 2012-13 budget. Doggett says the Texas language was intended to prevent a repeat of what happened in 2009 with $3.25 billion in education stimulus funding while lawmakers were writing the 2010-11 budget. "Governor Perry played a shell game that left Texas schools not a dime better off than if no federal aid had come in the first place," Doggett said in remarks on the House floor Feb. 18. Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us by e-mail that the federal assistance enabled the state to free up some of its own funds to plug other holes in the budget. Is that what really happened? Collins, making the case for her statement, cited a page in the 2010-11 state budget breaking down the federal stimulus dollars that flowed through the Texas Education Agency. The page shows an infusion of $3.25 billion and a reduction of the same amount in general revenue — state dollars — budgeted for public education. So, straight swap-out? Texas experts said it’s not so clear-cut. Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us that the "reduction" shown in general revenue does not mean lawmakers moved state money from education to other parts of the budget, like prisons. Her point: Lawmakers did not expect to have enough money to cover the $3.25 billion in education expenses to begin with. They penciled in the stimulus funds to make up for "a lack of state revenue," she said. All told, according to a June 19, 2009, Statesman story, the Legislature that year used $12 billion in stimulus money to balance the 2010-11 budget, leaving "untouched the state's estimated $9.1 billion rainy day fund," which accumulates revenue mainly from oil and gas production taxes. School finance expert and lobbyist Lynn Moak, whose clients include a consortium of the state’s largest school districts, also told us that the state used the $3.25 billion in stimulus funds to pay for education costs it couldn’t otherwise cover on its own. He said the $3.25 billion in federal money could be roughly broken into two pieces. About $1.4 billion made up for the projected loss of income from a state endowment fund covering textbook purchases and part of the state’s share of education funding. Moak said the other $1.9 billion paid for increases in state aid to districts and $800 pay raises for teachers and some other personnel that lawmakers approved during the session. DeLuna Castro told us that the Legislature either had to find a way to pay the $3.25 billion in educational expenses or change the laws governing the spending. If the stimulus funds had not arrived, how could Texas have paid the education costs? According to a September 2010 report by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, which represents several hundred largely Texas-based businesses and legal and accounting firms, lawmakers would have had to draw from the rainy day fund, raise taxes to bring in more revenue or cut spending elsewhere in the budget. Texas avoided doing any of that by using the stimulus money to "backfill" funding for public education, the report says. Backfilling, plugging holes — what does that mean? Simply put, the state used federal dollars to meet spending obligations it would otherwise have had to cover with its own money or cut that spending altogether. The report points to a March 2010 study of 20 states, including Texas, stating that they all "in essence ‘backfilled budget holes’" with federal education stimulus dollars. Next, we reached Michael Rebell, an author of the study, which was conducted by the Campaign for Educational Equity, an education policy research center at Columbia University’s Teachers College. Rebell, the campaign’s executive director, told us what the states did was not illegal. "In fact, it was the overwhelming pattern" among the states studied, he said. We reviewed the stimulus law and found no prohibition against using the federal money to supplant state funding. However, there were many indications that the Obama administration wanted the money to be used to expand state education efforts in several areas noted in the stimulus legislation, including improving teacher effectiveness and supporting struggling schools. In a June 18, 2009, letter to the Pennsylvania governor, Education Secretary Arne Duncan wrote: "If a state has done nothing more than backfill budget holes with these dollars when the state had other resources available to it, such as a rainy-day fund, the state's competitive position to receive (future stimulus money) may be negatively impacted." The following month, the Texas Education Agency announced that the U.S. Education Department had approved the state’s application to receive the $3.25 billion in education stimulus funding. Finally, we asked the experts whether Collins’ take on how the state used the $3.25 billion was a fair one. Responses varied. Moak said that in his view, lawmakers used those federal funds "like it was general revenue, and they put it where they thought it was easiest to justify putting it and follow the law at the same time." Had the state not received the federal aid, the Legislature would have had to take money from other parts of the budget to pay for the education expenses, "assuming that they weren’t going to raise revenue" or change the laws mandating the spending, he said. Dick Lavine, senior fiscal analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us that supplanting state education funds with stimulus money freed up $3.25 billion in general revenue for other state operations. Whether that plugged holes depends on whether the state would have cut spending for those operations if the money hadn’t been there, Lavine said. Talmadge Heflin, director of the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation's Center for Fiscal Policy, described Collins’ claim as "disputable." He said lawmakers used the stimulus money to pay for education expenses that might not have otherwise been fully funded. "Simply because no new (education) initiatives were funded is not grounds for claiming money was shifted from education to other purposes," he said. Dale Craymer, TTARA’s president, said: "The federal stimulus dollars used for education were lawfully used for education and were not diverted for other purposes. As introduced, and before the stimulus money became available, the proposed 2010-11 (state) budget was in the red. We simply could not divert money we did not have in the first place." Summing up: Collins gives Perry too much credit for apportioning funds; the Legislature did that when it wrote the budget that Perry signed it into law. She also incorrectly implies that the $3.25 billion in education stimulus funds did not go to schools — it did. But there is an element of truth to Collins’ larger point. Federal stimulus dollars for education made it possible for Texas budget writers to put some of the state’s general revenue funds elsewhere. Broadly, an even greater infusion of stimulus money helped to get Texas out of a tight budget fix and keep its rainy day fund intact. We rate Collins’ statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12728	"Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea. ... There are multiple news outlets that have reported" former President Barack Obama ordered wiretapping on Trump.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/05/sarah-huckabee-sanders/why-white-houses-defense-trump-accusing-obama-wire/	President Donald Trump’s White House offered dubious explanations on the Sunday shows to defend Trump’s Twitter accusation that former President Barack Obama wiretapped phones at Trump Tower before the 2016 election. The president, a spokeswoman said on ABC’s This Week, didn’t come up with the storyline out of thin air. He was echoing reports from "multiple news outlets." "Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there," said deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on March 5. "There are multiple news outlets that have reported this." At one point in the segment, Sanders specifically named the New York Times and BBC as news outlets that have covered the wiretapping allegations. Show host Martha Raddatz pushed back and said Trump started this issue with his specific tweet. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Sanders repeated her point: "I hardly say he started this when there were multiple news reports prior to that." If the basis of Trump's comment is media reports, he doesn't have a case. A White House spokesperson sent PolitiFact five articles from the BBC, HeatStreet, the New York Times, the National Review and a transcript from Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier as evidence of Sanders’ claim. Before we get into those, it’s worth noting that many news outlets have suggested Trump’s remark was inspired by a March 3 post on Breitbart News. The post was not included by Trump’s team as backup, but the Breitbart article links to some of the other reports. The Breitbart article followed up on comments by Mark Levin on a March 2 segment of his conservative radio show. During the show, Levin claimed Obama’s administration used "police state" tactics in the fall to watch over Trump’s team. Trump sent his tweet early March 4. As of March 5, he had still not provided evidence. "How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!" Trump wrote. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Breitbart article recapped 10 news events of the 2016 campaign that laid the foundation for Obama’s administration to "eavesdrop on the Trump campaign." Among the events included as an example is the Wikileaks release of emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, which the Clinton campaign used to blame "Trump and the Russians. The Breitbart article also mentions two requests under the the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which grants a court the authority to grant (or deny) warrants for electronic surveillance. The reporting about FISA requests is taken from a Nov. 7, 2016, report from the conservative-leaning website called HeatStreet. HeatStreet published an article, it said, based on two unnamed sources. "The FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counterintelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia," reads a line from the HeatStreet piece. The story says the FISA warrant was in relation to an investigation to the "Trump campaign, and its alleged links to two banks; SVB Bank and Russia’s Alfa Bank." Other reports about this FISA requests come from the BBC and the Guardian. (The White House did not send the Guardian over as evidence.) Importantly, these sources do not back up Trump’s accusation that Obama himself ordered the wiretap as part of political sabotage. On Jan. 12, the BBC reported that lawyers from the National Security Division in the Department of Justice filed applications to the court that handles intelligence matters related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA. "A lawyer — outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case — told me that three of Trump's associates were the subject of the inquiry," wrote Paul Wood, a British journalists who wrote the article in first person. The article did not say anything about Trump Tower. Six months earlier, the Guardian reported that the FBI applied for a warrant to monitor members of Trump’s teams interactions with Russia from the FISA court in June. The story was light on the details. It said the June application was turned down by the court, and briefly mentioned a report that the FBI was granted a warrant in October, but that has yet to be confirmed. Trump’s team also sent over two articles from the New York Times. These articles are about intelligence probes related to Trump associates and Russian officials. The first article, published on Jan. 12, reported that "American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of then- President-elect Trump." At one point, the article indicates that intelligence reports stemming from the intercepts were given to Obama’s administration. "One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House," it reads. The other article from Jan. 12 is about the Obama’s administration expanding the powers of the National Security Agency through new rules that relaxed limits on "collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches." Trump’s team also cited an article from the National Review as well as a March 3 Fox News interview between host Bret Baier and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The National Review article repeats the same information from HeatStreet. Baier asked Ryan about the report on FISA requests, which Ryan said he had not heard about. To be clear, that isn’t an example of Fox independently confirming the HeatStreet report. It’s worth noting that Obama's director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said on NBC’s Meet the Press he was not aware of any wiretaps that Trump alleged. And Obama, through a spokesman, has denied wiretapping Trump Tower. And Obama officials have also said a president cannot unilaterally order a wiretap. Our ruling Sanders said "multiple news outlets" have reported that Obama ordered wiretaps on Trump, including high-profile sources such as the New York Times and BBC. Trump’s team cited multiple reports to back up this claim, but it’s clear only one is at the root of Trump’s claim: a November 2016 blog post based on anonymous sources that has not been corroborated by independent U.S. journalists. Trump's spokeswoman made it sound as if Trump was merely following a well-documented string of reports, but that is not the case. A few of the reports allude to the FBI requesting permission from FISA to eavesdrop on Trump’s associates, but none (minus the anonymously sourced website) definitively said the probes centered on Trump himself or came directly from Obama. We rate this claim False. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Sarah Huckabee Sanders	None	None	None	2017-03-05T17:01:49	2017-03-05	['Barack_Obama', 'Donald_Trump']
pomt-06711	U.S. Reps. Hank Johnson, John Lewis and other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are "socialists who are openly serving in the U.S. Congress."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/02/sovereign-citizens-united/did-group-get-it-right-calling-caucus-socialists/	In today’s acerbic political environment, labels are constantly being placed on elected officials to define them as extreme, out-of-touch or just nuts. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon recently investigated one controversial label placed on several dozen members of Congress since it included two of that state’s representatives. A Pennsylvania-based group called Sovereign Citizens United claimed on its website that members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are "socialists who are openly serving in the U.S. Congress." The 77-member caucus includes longtime U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat from Atlanta, and U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat. The caucus is often characterized as liberal-leaning in news reports. But socialist? The S-word is overwhelmingly considered a toxic label in American politics. Yet, it is used more frequently these days, most often as a way to demonize liberal politicians. Socialism is the idea of the government controlling the entire means of production of goods and services for its citizens. That contrasts with liberalism in American politics -- the idea that the government should offer a wide array of programs to help citizens. The group claimed it had proof to back up its claim, and its online posting was picked up by others. PolitiFact Oregon was interested because of the type of claim that was being made and that it was being circulated by several outlets in different parts of the country. PolitiFact Oregon was unable to contact Sovereign Citizens United, but we had better luck. Sovereign Citizens United sent us about a dozen e-mails defending its claim. "The Progressive Caucus in Congress WAS CREATED BY the Democratic Socialists of America," they wrote us in one e-mail. "Because of this tie, any member of Congress who is a member of the Progressive Caucus is indeed arguing with [sic] the Democratic Socialists of America." A spokesman for Johnson wondered if Sovereign Citizens United was the same outfit that is occasionally busted for living in spacious vacant or foreclosed homes, because it believes it is immune to federal and state laws and that only people -- not banks -- can own land. So did we. News accounts refer to those suspects as "Sovereign Citizens." Sovereign Citizens United lists itself as a group attempting to stop the undermining of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights by "U.N. globalists." We couldn’t find any evidence this group was involved in any suspected criminal activity. So what about the group’s statement concerning the congressmen and the caucus? Sovereign Citizens United cited a KeyWiki article that claims the DSA helped create the caucus. The group sent us a link to a website with information the group says is evidence that the DSA created the caucus. The website, Sovereignty.net, says the DSA boasts the creation of the caucus. Not true on both accounts, says Frank Llewellyn, the DSA’s outgoing national director. Brad Bauman, the caucus’ executive director, called the claim "categorically false." "It was not started by any socialist organization. It was not started by any socialists,"Bauman said of the caucus, founded in 1991. "The fact that anyone would call into question [the caucus members’] patriotism is shocking to me." The KeyWiki page has a link to an article on an obscure website that has one sentence that says the DSA helped organize the caucus. The DSA has a four-page questions-and-answers section that says it works to "strengthen the [Democratic Party’s] left wing, represented by the Congressional Progressive Caucus." Sovereign Citizens United points to that quote as proof that the caucus is heavily influenced by the DSA. "The Congressional Progressive Caucus is by and from the U.S. Socialist party through the DSA," they told us. Llewellyn said that page is old, "a little ambiguous" and now probably wouldn’t reference the Democratic Party’s left wing. The DSA, which claims to have about 6,000 members, would prefer an alternative third party that supports its values. Llewellyn said some of its policy differences with the CPC include: The DSA supports larger reductions in military spending. The DSA wants to restore federal income tax rates to pre-Reagan administration levels, when they were much higher for the top earners. Llewellyn said there are no members of Congress who are members of the DSA and he rolls his eyes at claims that President Barack Obama is a socialist. "We have a banner that says ‘Obama is not a socialist, but we are,’ " Llewellyn said. In 2009, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described Democratic Socialist, wrote an op-ed in the Huffington Post arguing that no one else in Congress thinks similarly. Spokespeople for Johnson and Lewis both rejected any claims to being socialists or members of the DSA. Our ruling Sovereign Citizens United believes it has evidence that shows the Congressional Progressive Caucus thinks like socialists and is under the thumb of the Democratic Socialists of America. The evidence is rather flimsy and, in some cases, bogus. The DSA doesn’t boast on its website that it created the caucus, as the sovereign group claims. Like PolitiFact Oregon, we give this claim our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.

pomt-07323	George Allen "had 40,000 earmarks" while he was a senator.	false	/virginia/statements/2011/may/13/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-george-allen-had-40000-earmarks-/	Tea Party organizer Jamie Radtke says George Allen was a big spender during his time in the U.S. Senate. Allen and Radtke are among five candidates vying in next year’s Republican primary for the Senate seat occupied by Democrat Jim Webb, who will not seek reelection. In a May 4 telephone interview with the WJHL 11 Connect television, which serves northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, Radtke used a startling statistic to attack Allen’s 2001-2007 Senate term. "He had 40,000 earmarks," she said. Earmarks -- better known as "pork" -- are the line items inserted into larger bills that direct federal spending to specific projects. Lawmakers request the earmarks during the appropriations process, often to direct money to projects back in their home state. Radtke’s 40,000 figure seemed bizarrely high to us. Allen served in the Senate for 2,193 days. So he would have had to request an average of 18 earmarks a day to reach that tally. We asked Chuck Hansen, a spokesman for the Radtke campaign, where her information came from. Hansen said Radtke’s position isn’t that Allen personally requested those items, but rather that he "voted for" 40,000 earmarks by supporting larger appropriations bills containing the line items. "He owns all the votes for all those 40,000 earmarks even if they weren’t Virginia earmarks," Hansen said. We’ll examine that argument in a second. But first we should point out that Radtke has repeatedly suggested Allen requested the 40,000 earmarks. In a Jan. 29 story in the National Journal, she was asked if Allen should have voted against the appropriations bills during his tenure. "Well a good starting point is not to have 40,000 earmarks of your own," in those bills, Radtke was quoted as saying. In a March 15 Twitter post, Radtke mused about the possibility of stripping the funds from "Allen’s 40,000 earmarks." A March 25 blog post on Radtke’s website added some qualifications, but it still took Allen to task for his earmarks record. "Allen supported nearly 40,000 earmarks during his six years in the Senate, costing taxpayers more than $90 billion," Radtke’s post said. All this begs the question: Where did the 40,000 earmarks tally come? Hansen said the campaign arrived at that number using figures from Citizens Against Government Waste, a conservative non-profit group that has long derided earmarks. CAGW has posted on its website an annual list of what it calls "pork projects" from fiscal years 1991-2010. The group says the projects it counts have to fit at least one of seven criteria, among them that the line items were requested by only one house of Congress, were not subject to hearings or serve only a local interest. Radtke’s campaign tallied 52,319 congressional earmarks for 2002-2006. Seeking a conservative estimate, Hansen said they lopped off a budget year when Allen was in the Senate and then dropped the tally to 40,000 earmarks. Those tens of thousands of earmarks were included in appropriations bills during Allen’s term. Because Allen voted for all the appropriations bills that came up while he was in the Senate, Radtke’s campaign concluded he supported each of the 40,000 earmarks that were contained deep within those spending bills. Is it legitimate to blame Allen for earmarks other lawmakers’ earmarks because he voted for the overall appropriations bills? Josh Gordon, policy director at The Concord Coalition, a non-partisan organization seeking balanced federal budgets, said Radtke is leveling "kind of an absurd criticism." "I think if you were going to criticize someone for earmarks, the more appropriate measure would be the amount of earmarks the senator requested for Virginia, and how many he got," Gordon said. "You can’t just not fund the government because one of the 535 representatives (in Congress) has a $1,000 check going to somewhere in his district." Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute think tank, agreed the better measure of a legislator’s earmark record is whether they vote for bills containing items that they themselves requested. But DeHaven does not give legislators a complete pass on earmark culpability when they vote for "earmark-laden" bills. "He’s still culpable for voting for the underlying bills, all the bills that contain those thousands of earmarks," DeHaven said. It’s impossible to track down the amount of earmarks that Allen requested because when he left office in 2007, members of Congress weren’t required to disclose whether they requested a particular line item. That changed in 2008. For what it’s worth, we dug deeper into the Citizens Against Government Waste database and found that it lists 1,135 earmarks for Virginia from 2002-2006. They could have been requested by any and all of Virginia’s 13-member congressional delegation. The total cost of those line items: about $1.2 billion according to the database. So, where does this trip down earmark lane lead us? Radtke, at least three times, said that Allen "had 40,000 earmarks" during his tenure in the Senate. That suggests he actually requested those line items. Her campaign spokesman said that she means that Allen "voted for" those earmarks because that he said were included in overall appropriations bills that Allen supported. But that’s not what she said. Her statement is False.	None	Jamie Radtke	None	None	None	2011-05-13T12:47:34	2011-05-04	['None']
pomt-08478	In ad attacking Rick Scott, says three executives of the Columbia/HCA hospital chain he ran were indicted.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/fraud-allegations-dominate-new-democat-ad-attackin/	Democrat Alex Sink is airing a rare, two-minute campaign ad that tries to again hammer Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott over allegations he was involved in fraud while running mega hospital chain Columbia/HCA. The spot, called "Fraud Files," opens more like an introduction to a Dateline NBC episode than a campaign commercial, mixing a narrator's voice with short clips from TV. At one point, a female reporter says, "Three executives of Columbia/HCA health care corp. have been indicted." The ad doesn't make reference to the executives again. That's what we're for. First, a little bit of back story on Scott and Columbia/HCA. Scott started what was first called Columbia in the spring of 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country's largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals. In early 1997, federal agents revealed they were investigating the Columbia/HCA chain for, among other things, Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Allegations included that Columbia/HCA billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and that the hospital chain would perform one type of medical test but bill the federal government for a more expensive test or procedure. Agents seized records from Columbia facilities across the country in Tennessee, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Florida. Scott resigned in the middle of the federal investigation in July 1997. Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations; the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle, and did. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. The company agreed to further settlements in 2002, paying an additional $881 million in fines. In July 1997, three Columbia/HCA executives were indicted on charges of Medicare fraud in connection with billing at a Port Charlotte hospital. Indicted were Jay A. Jarrell, CEO of Columbia's Southwest Division, based in Fort Myers; Michael T. Neeb, chief financial officer of Columbia's Jacksonville Division; and Robert W. Whiteside, director of reimbursement for Columbia in Nashville. The government accused the three executives of conspiring to overbill Medicare by inflating the hospital's capital expenses -- money spent on hospital facilities and equipment. That allowed the hospital to be overpaid by about $1.8 million, the government claimed. A fouth executive, Carl Lynn Dick, was subsequently indicted in July 1998. Dick, director of finance for Columbia's East Florida division in Orlando, was charged with conspiracy to defraud government insurance programs. After an eight-week federal jury trial in 1999, including three days of deliberations, Jarrell and Whiteside were found guilty on six counts of fraud and sentenced to 33 months and 24 months in prison respectively. That same jury acquitted Neeb of all charges, and failed to reach a verdict on Dick. Jarrell and Whiteside's convictions, however, were overturned on appeal. The two men never served any prison sentence. Columbia/HCA did also plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies, but those felonies come with fines, not prison time. No one else was indicted or tried in connection with the criminal fraud investigation. In their two-minute ad attacking Scott, Florida Democrats say three executives of Columbia/HCA were indicted for fraud. They were, as was a fourth. But the government failed to secure a conviction on any of the executives indicted. That's a noteworthy caveat that would have put the indictments in the proper context. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-10357	"Throughout his time in elected office, Barack Obama has taken multiple positions on banning handguns and the D.C. handgun ban."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/08/john-mccain/obama-consistently-on-the-fence/	When it comes to gun control issues, there is clear separation between John McCain and Barack Obama. So when on June 26 the Supreme Court made one of the most important gun rulings in decades - concluding that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm and that the Washington DC gun ban is unconstitutional - one naturally expected contrasting opinions from the political rivals. Instead, they acted like opposing boxers who both raise their arms in victory after the final bell. McCain quickly pronounced it "a landmark victory for Second Amendment freedom." McCain noted that while he was among a bipartisan (though mostly Republican) group of congressmen who signed a "friend of the court" brief arguing against the DC law, Obama did not. "Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness," McCain stated, "today's ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right -- sacred, just as the right to free speech and assembly." That was a dig at Obama for his heavily scrutinized statement about people living in struggling rural towns. He said it was "not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion...as a way to explain their frustrations." But when Obama issued a statement an hour after McCain's, he said the Supreme Court ruling affirmed what he has been saying all along. "I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms, but I also identify with the need for crime-ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common-sense, effective safety measures. The Supreme Court has now endorsed that view, and while it ruled that the D.C. gun ban went too far, Justice Scalia himself acknowledged that this right is not absolute and subject to reasonable regulations enacted by local communities to keep their streets safe. Today's ruling, the first clear statement on this issue in 127 years, will provide much-needed guidance to local jurisdictions across the country." The McCain campaign responded by accusing Obama of waffling on the issue. "Throughout his time in elected office, Barack Obama has taken multiple positions on banning handguns and the D.C. handgun ban. He has stated his belief that handgun bans were constitutional and he supported them. Then he actually refused to state a position." Silent on the DC ban In the months leading up to the Supreme Court decision, Obama did, in fact, skirt the issue of whether he though the DC gun ban was constitutional. Instead, he repeatedly said he believed the Second Amendment protected an individual's right to bear arms, but that it does not preclude local governments from enacting "common sense" laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. The main issue before the Supreme Court was whether the second Amendment protected an individual right to possess a firearm, or whether it only protected possession of a firearms connected to service in a militia. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that it was an individual right. Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Center and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says the Supreme Court ended up right where Obama was. "Obama has said pretty consistently that he felt the second amendment provided an individual right to own a gun," he said. That position was at odds with the Brady Center's position - which it submitted to the Supreme Court - that the Second Amendment only guaranteed the rights of gun ownership for militias. "We lost," Helmke said. McCain's case against Obama But the McCain campaign says Obama has waffled, that he has supported the DC gun ban in the past. They provide three main pieces of evidence: * The first is a 1996 voter questionnaire Obama completed while running for a seat in the Illinois senate. The "Independent Voters of Illinois" asked if the candidate supported state legislation to "ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns." Obama's answer: "Yes." The 1996 voter form surfaced again last year. The Obama campaign claimed the questionnaire was filled out by a campaign aide who "unintentionally mischaracterize[d] his position." The Web site Politico.com investigated and found that while Obama's campaign claimed Obama never saw or approved the responses in the questionnaire, the campaign at the time filed an amended version, which appeared to include Obama's own handwritten notes added to one answer (not the one on gun control). Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Obama's campaign, said in an e-mailed statement to Politico, "He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire at the meeting, but that doesn't change the fact that some answers didn't reflect his views." • The second alleged contradiction comes from a Chicago Tribune article on Nov. 20, 2007 in which the Obama campaign is quoted as saying Obama "believes that we can recognize and respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners and the right of local communities to enact common sense laws to combat violence and save lives. Obama believes the D.C. handgun law is constitutional." The statement, which came from an unnamed campaign aide "was obviously an inartful attempt to explain the Senator's consistent position," Obama spokesman Bill Burton told ABC News. • Lastly, the McCain campaign notes that in a forum sponsored by WJLA-ABC7 and Politico.com on Feb. 12, 2008, Obama did not dispute a questioner's characterization of Obama's position as supporting the DC handgun ban. Here's the text of the exchange: Leon Harris of WJLA: "One other issue that is of great importance to the people of the district here, is gun control. You said in Idaho here, recently, that "I have no intention of taking away folks' guns." But you support the D.C. handgun ban, and you've said that it's constitutional. How do you reconcile those two positions?" Obama responded, "Because I think we have two conflicting traditions in this country. I think it's important for us to recognize that we've got a tradition of handgun ownership and gun ownership generally. And a lot of people – law-abiding citizens use if for hunting, for sportsmanship, and for protecting their families. We also have a violence on the streets that is the result of illegal handgun usage. And so I think there is nothing wrong with a community saying, we are going to take those illegal handguns off the streets, we are going to trace more effectively how these guns are ending up on the streets, to unscrupulous gun dealers, who often times are selling to straw purchasers, and cracking down on the various loopholes that exist in terms of background checks for children, the mentally ill...We can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measure that I think respect the Second Amendment and people's traditions." A look at the votes The National Rifle Association isn't buying Obama's "election-year rhetoric" in support of individuals' right to keep and bear arms. The NRA says Obama's voting record -which they have consistently rated an "F" - suggests he would be "a serious threat to Second Amendment liberties." Here's some of Obama's voting record: As a state senator in Illinois in 2004, Obama voted against a measure to lower the minimum age to apply for a Firearm Owner's Identification Card from 21 to 18. That same year, an Illinois state senator proposed giving people who violate city gun bans the right to use self-defense as a legal argument if they were charged for violating a ban. Obama opposed the measure. As a U.S. Senator, Obama voted in July 2005 against a bill to prohibit civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers or dealers resulting from the misuse of their products. The NRA contended the bill was designed to bankrupt the firearms industry. McCain voted in favor of the prohibition, which passed 65-31. Obama also voted for an amendment to expand the definition of prohibited, armor-piercing ammunition. The NRA claimed it would have banned much of the rifle ammunition commonly used for hunting. McCain voted against it and it failed. Both Obama and McCain voted in favor of a requirement that manufacturers and importers of handguns provide child safety locks. In 2006, both Obama and McCain voted for an amendment to prohibit the confiscation of a lawfully owned firearm during an emergency or major disaster. According to Obama's campaign Web site, Obama supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent, "as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets." McCain has voted against the assault weapons ban. There's no question McCain has taken a far more conservative line on gun ownership. But he hasn't always been a darling of the NRA. Although for years McCain enjoyed an A rating from the NRA, in 2004, the NRA gave McCain just a C+. The drop was based largely on two votes the NRA did not agree with: one in favor of instant background checks at gun shows (McCain even cut TV ads lobbying for it); and McCain's campaign finance reform legislation, which the NRA viewed as an attempt to stifle its voice. Since 2004, Parsons said, McCain has voted 100 percent in line with the NRA. On the fence So here's what we have to support the claim of an Obama flip-flop: one answer to a questionnaire in 1996 that Obama claims was completed in error by a staffer; a quote attributed to a campaign aide in 2007, also later disavowed by Obama; and failing to dispute the characterization of his position in a campaign forum in February. It's a bit too convenient for the Obama campaign to dismiss a record it doesn't like by claiming that twice in his career aides misstated his position on gun control. At the end of the day, voters simply have to decide if they believe Obama's explanation or they don't. Finally, there's the question in the forum in which Obama's position was characterized as supporting the DC gun ban, and that it was constitutional. Obama's answer seemed like an attempt to cling to his position atop the fence, repeating his belief that the Second Amendment affirms an individual's right to own a gun, but that local governments ought to be able to limit that right. But what about DC's outright ban of guns? Obama not only didn't correct Harris' characterization of support for the DC gun ban, his answer seemed to affirm that it was accurate. At the very least, if Harris was wrong, here was the perfect opportunity to set the record straight. By and large, Obama's fence-sitting has been pretty consistent. Still, twice claiming an aide botched your position and failing to go on record even when directly asked about it gives the McCain campaign enough ammo to merit a Half True.

pomt-04654	Says Obama doubled funding for the Pell Grant.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/11/kal-penn/kal-penn-thanks-obama-doubling-funding-pell-grant/	Sandwiched between Kal Penn’s laugh lines during his Democratic National Convention speech -- including his appeal for viewers to include "#sexyface" in their tweets about his remarks -- were claims about President Barack Obama’s accomplishments. "Now, I've worked on a lot of fun movies, but my favorite job was having a boss who gave the order to take out bin Laden, and who's cool with all of us getting gay-married. So thank you, invisible man in the chair, for that," he said, referencing Clint Eastwood’s off-the-cuff remarks to an empty chair at the Republican National Convention. "And for giving my friends access to affordable health insurance and doubling funding for the Pell Grant." Penn, the Harold and Kumar star who spent a couple years in the White House Office of Public Engagement, was among several speakers who praised Obama for doubling the Pell Grant. The grant program is a popular, 40-year-old federal subsidy for middle- and low-income students that does not have to be repaid. A person’s eligibility is determined by several factors, including how much money his or her family makes. Penn’s claim that Pell Grants have doubled is true, in terms of expenditures. In the 2008-09 academic year, Pell Grant expenditures were about $18 billion. In 2011-12, expenditures are $36 billion. While funding has doubled, the number of students who receive Pell Grants has increased more slowly. In 2008, the grants assisted 6.1 million students, while in 2012, 9.7 million students received aid, an increase of 59 percent. Experts point to a few factors to explain increased Pell spending: more people going to or returning to college because of the recession and more people in need of grants because of the recession. Some recipients are receiving larger awards. Four years ago, the maximum Pell Grant award was $4,731, according to the Department of Education. The max has been $5,550 since 2010. It’s expected to increase to $5,635 in the 2013-14 academic year and will rise in line with inflation through 2017. "Absolutely, (Obama)’s made it a priority," said Robert Moran, director of federal relations at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. Still, the feds have tinkered with the program’s eligibility as a way to reduce some of the costs. Moran said he’s seen projections that say more than 100,000 students didn’t qualify for grants because of these changes. Students used to be eligible for a second Pell Grant, known as a "summer Pell," to help them accelerate their degree year-round. This short-lived program was cut as part of the appropriations bill passed in April 2011. And HR 2055, which Obama signed in December, maintains the maximum award through 2013 but makes several changes to reduce $10 billion in spending over the next decade.For example, the law reduced the maximum number of full-time semesters of eligibility from 18 semesters to 12. Plus, the grant covers less than it did a decade ago. According to The College Board, it helped with 42 percent of a student’s average tuition, fees, and room and board at public four-year colleges and universities in 2001-02. That fell to 32 percent in 2011-12. Advocates of the Pell Grant like the expansion but worry about the program’s budget shortfalls and what cuts it may face as lawmakers seek to reduce the deficit. Our ruling Kal Penn correctly stated Obama doubled funding for the Pell Grant. It’s true Obama has made maintaining the maximum award for these grants a priority over his tenure, and the result has been a whole lot more spending. To help pay for this spending, though, the federal government has changed some of the program’s eligibility requirements, so that it’s more difficult to get the grants.

pomt-00878	If President Barack Obama strikes a nuclear deal with Iran, "the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/11/tom-cotton/letter-iran-47-republican-senators-correct-about-c/	The Obama administration’s efforts to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran were already contentious. But they got more so -- if that’s possible -- on March 9, 2015, with the release of a letter by 47 Republican senators. The missive, labeled "an open letter to the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran," was structured as a civics lesson -- one intended to underscore that even if Iran is negotiating with the executive branch, Congress is not powerless in the process. A key portion of the 286-word letter says that the undersigned senators "will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei. The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time." Critics called the letter unprecedented for seeming to meddle with the president’s authority to handle negotiations with foreign countries. Vice President Joe Biden said the letter "is beneath the dignity of an institution I revere." Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said the letter "has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy." At a State Department briefing the day the letter was released, spokeswoman Jen Psaki went so far as to say the letter was factually incorrect. "Congress doesn't have the power to alter the terms of international arrangements negotiated by the executive," Psaki said at the briefing. "The letter is incorrect when it says that Congress could modify the terms of the agreement at any time." We were intrigued by the crossfire between the State Department and Congress about whether this passage of the letter was accurate, so we took a closer look. (Neither spokespersons for the letter’s primary author, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., nor the State Department responded to emailed questions for this article.) The independent experts we spoke to said the Republican senators’ letter was generally correct, but also was something of an oversimplification. Treaties vs. executive agreements To answer this question, it’s important to understand the differences between two types of international agreements. Treaties with foreign countries are negotiated and signed by the executive branch, but ratification only occurs after the Senate gives its approval in a two-thirds vote. But there’s another kind of agreement beyond treaties -- indeed, they represent a growing share of agreements in recent decades. They are known as "executive agreements." The procedure for treaties is spelled out in the Constitution, but there’s little in the Constitution about executive agreements. Their authority comes instead from longstanding practice, as well as the support of such Supreme Court cases as United States vs. Belmont (1936), United States vs. Pink (1941), and Dames and Moore vs. Regan (1981). "Presidents since Washington have concluded such agreements, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the president has the authority to conclude such agreements," said Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service. The upside of pursuing an executive agreement is that they are easier to negotiate -- they don’t require approval from Congress, which (as the current episode makes clear) removes a major obstacle. The downside of an executive agreement, however, is that it’s easier to reverse. "It is clear, constitutionally, under internal law, that a future president could do this," said Jeffrey S. Peake, a Clemson University political scientist. Arend concurred that such an action would likely be constitutional. As for Congress, "what it can do is legislate, and a valid federal statute will prevail in a conflict with an executive agreement," said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania legal scholar. This stems from the Supreme Court decision in Whitney vs. Robertson (1888), which held that a treaty is placed on the same footing as an act of legislation, and that if they cannot coexist, "the one last in date will control the other." "So in that sense, the senators are right," Roosevelt said. It’s worth noting that the design of the potential deal with Iran would seem to include a role for Congress in any case. The deal in the making is widely believed to include a temporary lifting of sanctions in the short term, and a permanent lifting of sanctions in the longer term. The temporary easing could be accomplished by the administration, but a permanent easing will most likely require congressional action. We’ll also note that there is some debate among legal scholars about whether the president alone has the power to negotiate something as major as a deal over nuclear weapons without any say by Congress. However, the senators’ letter suggests they don’t quarrel with the fact that he can do so, at least for an agreement that doesn’t extend beyond his term in office. The process isn’t so simple But while there’s support for the senators’ claims, most of our experts added that the letter oversimplified the matters at hand. Here are a few reasons why: • It is an exaggeration to say that future Congresses could "modify" an agreement "at any time." The possible agreement with Iran is being negotiated between the five permanent United Nations Security Council members plus one: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China, plus Germany. So for the agreement to be truly modified, the other signatories would have to sign off, Peake said -- something that is hardly a sure thing. Instead, Congress could pass legislation that conflicts with the agreement, effectively "modifying" it. But Congress' ability to carry this out is more difficult than the senators' blithe language suggests. "It would take presidential acquiescence or a supermajority -- two-thirds to override a veto -- for Congress to act independently to stiffen sanctions," Peake said. "It is very complex." Cotton's letter was signed by 47 senators, significantly less than the 67 senators needed to override a presidential veto. The 2016 elections are months away, but given the electoral map, it seems unlikely Republicans would be able to pick up that many more seats. Of course, the GOP could win the White House, in which case they may not need to override, but given the typical Senate threshold for taking up legislation, they would still need 60 votes, a challenging task. • Going back on an executive agreement may violate international law. While Congress has the power to violate international law -- and the ability of the international community to punish a violation is debatable -- "the real question, which I think both sides are missing, is whether overriding would violate international law," which requires compliance with binding agreements, said Michael D. Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego. • Going back on an executive agreement could have significant, if intangible, consequences for the nation’s diplomatic credibility. Retreating from one executive agreement would be a pretty radical step historically and could endanger the nation's ability to both ensure that old agreements stand and to strike new agreements. "For the president to vacate an executive agreement would be quite problematic," Peake said. It "would be largely unprecedented and cause the U.S. a great deal of grief in diplomacy, especially since 95 percent of international agreements are done via executive agreement rather than the constitutional treaty process." Indeed, Peake said, "It could call into question America’s commitment to the vast majority of her international agreements." Our ruling The letter written by Cotton said that if Obama strikes a nuclear deal with Iran, "the next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time." We found broad agreement among experts that a future president or a future Congress could indeed undo or modify the kind of agreement that’s currently being negotiated with Iran, but the senators’ letter makes the process sound more clear cut and easier than it actually is. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Tom Cotton	None	None	None	2015-03-11T12:01:36	2015-03-09	['United_States_Congress', 'Iran', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-11410	Says he "fought Obama twice and won to stop illegal immigrants from voting."	false	/georgia/statements/2018/mar/21/brian-kemp/Did-Brian-Kemp-fight-Obama-twice-to-stop-illegal/	Georgia Republican Brian Kemp is trying to win over Trump voters in his race for governor by saying he successfully fought the Obama administration to keep immigrants in the country illegally from voting in the state. Kemp, Georgia’s secretary of state since 2010, posted a campaign video on his Facebook page March 5 that invoked the deaths of Kate Steinle, Edwin Jackson and a Georgia family killed by a drunk driver in the country illegally, saying "we must secure the border and end sanctuary cities." Over black and white photos of Kemp and former President Barack Obama, a narrator then says: "As Secretary of State, Brian Kemp fought Obama twice and won to stop illegal immigrants from voting." Text under Obama’s photo said: "Fought Obama. Citizenship check. Photo ID." Is that true? Kemp’s video stretched the facts. Courts dismissed lawsuits filed by Kemp to change voting procedures in Georgia — after the Obama administration allowed the voting changes. Also, there’s no indication that Obama wanted immigrants in the country illegally voting. Kemp’s evidence Kemp’s campaign pointed to preclearance lawsuits filed on Georgia’s behalf in June and November of 2010 against then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Because of its history of voter discrimination, Georgia was one of several states whose voting changes were required to be precleared by either a federal court or the U.S. Justice Department. Per Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, in judicial reviews, jurisdictions must establish that proposed voting changes do not deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group. If jurisdictions seek administrative preclearance from the Justice Department, they can implement voting changes if the Attorney General affirmatively indicates no objection, or if at the expiration of 60 days, no objection to the submitted change has been interposed by the Attorney General. Both of Georgia’s lawsuits dealt with new rules to prevent people in the country illegally from casting votes. The first lawsuit concerned a voter verification process that required information on voter registration applications to match data kept by Georgia’s Department of Drivers Services and the Social Security Administration. The other lawsuit stemmed from a Georgia law requiring proof of citizenship from individuals registering to vote. In the end, both lawsuits were dismissed because the Justice Department approved the changes through the administrative process. The Justice Department did oppose one of the changes Georgia sought, but later found no objection after the state revised it. So, Kemp and the Justice Department eventually were on the same side. "As secretary of state, Brian Kemp sued the Obama Justice Department twice — and won — to implement Georgia's common sense citizenship check and Photo ID laws," said Ryan Mahoney, Kemp's campaign spokesman. New voter verification procedures were initially sought by former Secretary of State Karen Handel, who attempted to implement them before the 2008 general election. (She resigned in 2009 and is now in the U.S. House.) The Justice Department in 2008, under Republican President George W. Bush, "first questioned" the voter verification process, saying federal law requires states to verify a voter's identity, but not citizenship, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. "The state largely acted as it was required to by the Voting Rights Act, as has been necessary since the law was signed into law in 1965," said Barry C. Burden, a political science professor and director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "In both of the Georgia cases, the Department of Justice precleared the changes after reviewing them." Michael S. Kang, a law professor at Emory University School of Law, said "it’s odd" to claim that Kemp "fought Obama twice" on the basis of the 2010 lawsuits, since the Justice Department ultimately chose to preclear both voting changes. "In fact, many election law experts were surprised that the Justice Department under President Obama didn’t maintain an objection to these laws," Kang said. Finally, the ad creates the wrong impression that Obama wanted people in the country illegally to vote. But "there is zero evidence to support the implication that the Obama administration wanted to see illegal immigrants voting," Burden said. Kang said he is unaware of any serious evidence that "illegal immigrants" were voting in Georgia at the time. "I also do not believe that President Obama has supported voting by ‘illegal immigrants,’ " he said. Our ruling Kemp said he "fought Obama twice and won to stop illegal immigrants from voting." The facts don't suppport Kemp's assertion. The Obama administration allowed Georgia’s changes to stop noncitizens from voting to happen. As secretary of state, Kemp was required to seek approval for the changes from the Justice Department or a federal court. He got it from the Justice Department, so the lawsuits were dismissed. Experts described the process as routine under the law. The ad is flat-wrong to suggest that the Obama administration wanted immigrants in the country illegally to cast votes in elections.

pomt-13177	"The man who was in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton accepted essentially from Hillary Clinton $675,000 that went to his wife."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/26/donald-trump/facts-dispute-donald-trumps-claim-donation-fbi-spo/	Donald Trump has again questioned the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email practices as secretary of state, this time by citing a connection between a Virginia state Senate race and a man who would become the FBI's deputy director. Trump spoke about the latest Clinton controversy during Florida campaign stops in Sanford on Oct. 25 and the night before in Tampa. "One of the closest people to Hillary Clinton, with longstanding ties to her and husband -- the closest person, I can tell you that … gave more than $675,000 to the campaign of the wife of a top FBI official who oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's illegal email server," Trump said at the Sanford rally. "In other words, the man who was in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton accepted essentially from Hillary Clinton $675,000 that went to his wife." "Never happened before. Never happened. Not in this country's history," Trump continued. "This is a disgrace. And she shouldn't be allowed to run for president. She shouldn't be allowed. She's a crook." Trump’s claim, which suggests a quid pro quo, suffers one from fatal flaw: The timeframe doesn’t add up. At the time of the contribution, the candidate's husband was not directly involved in the FBI probe of Clinton's email server, according to the FBI. The bureau says that by the time he had some oversight role in the Clinton investigation, the election involving his wife had been over for three months. Here are the details. In 2015, Dr. Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, was recruited to run for one of the 40 seats in the Virginia's Republican-controlled Senate by Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who co-chaired Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign and chaired Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful 2008 run for president. According to the Wall Street Journal, which broke the story, McAuliffe and other Virginia Democrats met with McCabe and her husband, Andrew, on March 7, 2015, to urge her to run as part of an effort to take back the Senate. At the time, Andrew McCabe was assistant director of the FBI's field office in Washington and had focused much of his career on terrorism. The FBI released a statement that Andrew McCabe "consulted with top FBI headquarters and field office ethics officers for guidance, including briefings on the Hatch Act, to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest, in the event she decided to go forward." Based on that advice, the FBI said, when Dr. McCabe chose to run, Andrew "McCabe and FBI lawyers implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics, a process followed for the remainder of her campaign. During the campaign, he played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind." News that Clinton was using a private email account in violation of federal record-keeping requirements, broke March 2, 2015. McCabe announced her candidacy 10 days later on March 12, 2015. That July, the FBI was called in to begin a criminal investigation into the use of Clinton's private server at her home in New York. And that same month, Andrew McCabe was promoted to associate deputy director, the third in command at the FBI. He moved to FBI headquarters in September. Not surprisingly, both McAuliffe, through his political action committee, and the state Democratic Party, donated to Dr. McCabe's campaign. On Oct. 1, 27 and 29, McAuliffe's PAC, Common Good VA, gave Dr. McCabe's campaign a total of $450,000. (An additional $17,500 had been given earlier). The Democratic Party of Virginia spent $207,788 on Sept. 30 and Oct. 22 for mailings on her behalf. That would amount to 40 percent of the $1.7 million spent by the campaign. Two other Democrats running for Senate seats, Jeremy Pike and Dan Gecker, got larger amounts from McAuliffe's PAC. In November, Dr. McCabe lost her race to incumbent Republican Dick Black. On Feb. 1, 2016, three months after his wife's defeat, Andrew McCabe became the FBI's deputy director. In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI said it was the first time McCabe had any oversight role over the Clinton case. "Months after the completion of (his wife's) campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails," according to the FBI statement. But perhaps the biggest flaw in Trump's argument comes with his assertion that McCabe was in charge of the decision on whether to recommend prosecution. It was FBI Director James Comey, not McCabe, who made the decision to recommend that the Justice Department not file charges against Clinton. Comey has repeatedly explained his decision under oath. Finally, there has been no evidence put forth so far — and several people in Trump's campaign did not respond to our inquiry — that Clinton or her campaign were involved in the contributions or knew they were being made. Trump has simply claimed, the money came "essentially from Hillary Clinton," and that "Hillary knew this money was being paid." Our ruling Trump said, "The man who was in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton accepted essentially from Hillary Clinton $675,000 that went to his wife." Trump is correct that hefty donations were given from a Clinton ally to a candidate whose husband was an FBI official. But the timeline doesn’t add up, nor do Trump’s allegations stand up to independent scrutiny. At the time of the contribution, the candidate's husband was not directly involved in the FBI probe of Clinton's email server, according to the FBI. The bureau says that by the time he had some oversight role in the Clinton investigation, the election involving his wife had been over for three months. Meanwhile, the decision not charge Clinton was a recommendation made by the director of the FBI. Trump's statement contains a small element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a completely different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02348	In Virginia’s Medicaid program, "approximately 30 percent, or $2.7 billion a year, is lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/mar/23/jimmy-massie/jimmy-massie-says-30-percent-virginias-medicaid-sp/	Del. Jimmie Massie says expanding Medicaid basically amounts to throwing good money after bad. In Virginia’s Medicaid program, "approximately 30 percent, or $2.7 billion a year, is lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies," the Henrico County Republican wrote in a March 12 post on his Facebook page. Massie has made the same claim repeatedly this year in maintaining that Virginia should not rush to accept federal funds available under Obamacare to extend eligibility in the state’s Medicaid program to 400,000 low-income and disabled people. The General Assembly is starting a special session Monday to decide whether to expand Medicaid -- a partisan debate that is blocking passage of a two-year state budget. Massie and his GOP colleagues in the House refuse to broaden Medicaid before the state program has undergone a two-year audit. We wondered whether Massie’s claim of 30 percent waste, fraud and inefficiency in Virginia’s $8 billion a year Medicaid program is accurate. The delegate pointed us to a presentation in a December 2013 meeting before the Medicaid Innovation and Reform Commission, a panel seeking to streamline the state program. Massie sits on the commission. In the presentation, Virginia Secretary of Health Bill Hazel noted that a 2012 report by the Institute of Medicine estimated that out of the $2.5 trillion in total U.S. health care spending, about $765 billion was lost to waste. That comes to 30 percent. Hazel’s presentation included a pie chart showing that the national waste estimate, when applied to Virginia, equates to about $15 billion of the state’s $49 billion in annual, total health care spending. Hazel did not break down the figure any further, but Massie did. The delegate extended it to the state Medicaid program and concluded that about one third of its funds, or $2.7 billion a year, is being wasted. "I would be willing to bet the public sector is less efficient than the private sector, therefore the waste, fraud and inefficiencies in the public system is somewhat greater than 30 percent," Massie told us. We contacted Hazel for his take on Massie’s comments. Hazel, who supports Medicaid expansion, said his waste chart has been taken out of context. "The folks who say that reflects Medicaid, I believe are misusing the information because I don’t think it directly applies to Medicaid," Hazel said. We couldn’t find any figures on the amount of wasteful spending in Virginia’s Medicaid program and Hazel said a definitive estimate doesn’t exist. Now, let’s return to the original source of the 30 percent estimate -- the national study by the Institute of Medicine. The 416-page report does not offer waste estimates for individual states, let alone the Medicaid program in a state. Dr. Mark Smith, the chair of the committee that authored the IOM report, cautioned against taking the findings too far. "My comment on the face of is that 30 percent of overall spending being wasteful does not necessarily translate into 30 percent of Medicaid being wasteful, let alone Medicaid in a particular state," Smith told us in an email. We did find a study that offer broad insight into the amount of national fraud and waste major government health programs. In April 2012, a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association said that somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion of the $1 trillion spent nationally a year on Medicaid and Medicare is wasted. That comes down between 20 and 40 percent. The author of that report, Don Berwick, was President Barack Obama’s head of the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and is now running as a Democrat for governor of Massachusetts. He told us he did not have additional figures specifically looking a Medicaid. We should finally note that Virginia is an outlier state in many statistics measuring the scope of its Medicaid system. As noted in a 2012 report by the Joint legislative Audit Review Commission, the General Assembly’s watchdog agency, Virginia has one of the most restrictive Medicaid programs in the nation, both in terms of eligibility requirements and the services it provides. Our ruling Massie said that 30 percent of the Virginia’s Medicaid program is lost to waste, fraud and inefficiencies. He gets the figure by extrapolating an estimated amount of waste in all U.S. health care spending and applying it to the Medicaid program in Virginia. The problem is that no study has ever quantified the amount of Medicaid waste in Virginia, so nobody knows. We don’t completely dismiss Massie’s number, because a variety of studies say 30 percent is a reasonable national gauge of the waste in the health system and in overall government health programs. But Massie takes liberty in applying that rule to Virginia’s Medicaid system, one of the most restrictive programs in the nation. The burden falls on Massie to prove his statement and he offers nothing more than a hypothesis that he’s right. So we rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-13058	"President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/18/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-trump-congress-have-similar-im/	Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and future chief of staff for President-elect Donald Trump, dismissed criticism that legislators from his party and Trump were at odds on a series of issues. During the presidential campaign, Trump disagreed with House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans over mass deportations, trade, Social Security and Medicare, said Steve Rattner, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and an economic analyst on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. "How are you guys going to resolve those conflicts?" Rattner asked Priebus on the Nov. 14 show. "Well, there's not that many, the conflicts aren't as great as you're outlining," Priebus responded. "President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting. That's not extreme, that's exactly what is in the House today." Is Priebus right? We decided to check whether there currently are immigration policies in Congress similar to Trump’s proposals. Trump’s immigration policies On the campaign trail, Trump promised to build a wall to stop illegal immigration and to be tough on people who violated immigration laws. While he was inconsistent about his plans for the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, he was firm on deporting criminals. Trump also said he would limit legal immigration because "immigration flows are too large to perform adequate screening." Trump repeatedly criticized his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, for wanting to increase the number of refugees admitted into the United States from Syria, a country afflicted by terrorism. "When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats," Trump said June 13, 2016. In December 2015, Trump called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on." That comment came after a deadly attack in San Bernardino, Calif. In his 10-point immigration plan, Trump said he would "suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur, until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place." Congress policies We reached out to the Republican National Committee, chaired by Priebus, to find out which congressional policies specifically mirror Trump’s immigration proposals. We did not get a response from the committee or from the House Republican Conference. So we did some digging on our own. A bill called the American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced in the House a year ago, calling for additional screening of "covered aliens," to ensure they are not a threat to national security. The bill defines a "covered alien" as a person applying for admission as a refugee and who is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria; has no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in Iraq or Syria; or has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011. Individuals cannot be admitted as refugees until the FBI director certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and to the National Intelligence director that background investigations sufficiently determined they are not a threat to national security, the bill said. A refugee may also only be admitted after the Secretary of Homeland Security -- in unanimous agreement with the directors of the FBI and National Intelligence -- certifies to 12 "appropriate Congressional Committees" that the person is not a national security threat. The American SAFE Act of 2015 was introduced by Rep. Michael T. McCaul, R-Texas, and co-sponsored by 102 Republicans and one Democrat. It passed the House Nov. 19, 2015, with a 289-137 vote and stalled in the Senate in January. Another House bill, Give States a Chance Act of 2015, was introduced November 2015 to allow governors to refuse the placement of Syrian refugees in their respective states if they certify they are "not reasonably satisfied" that the refugee does not pose a security threat. Under that bill, the governor could also refuse a refugee if he or she "has not properly been informed of the intended sponsorship process for the refugee" and if the governor determines that the proposed resettlement location "is inappropriate because the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants" in the area is too high. Thirteen Republicans co-sponsored the bill introduced by Rep. Ted S. Yoho, R-Fla. It’s been referred to the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security. This summer, Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) also introduced in the House the Resettlement Accountability National Security Prioritization Act of 2016, to "suspend, and subsequently terminate, the admission of certain refugees." The bill is directed to nationals of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; or people who have no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in those specific countries. Forty-nine Republicans co-sponsored the bill, which would also evaluate the costs of benefits provided to refugees and their impact on national security. Babin’s bill to suspend admission of refugees sounds like what Priebus was talking about, said Steven Camarota, director of research at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies. Our ruling Priebus said, "President-elect Trump's immigration policies are very similar to policies that are sitting right in the Senate and the House today, to temporarily suspend immigration from countries that harbor terrorism, to temporarily suspend immigration from Syria until we get better vetting." Trump's policies include ending sanctuary cities, deporting at least 2 million people and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, not just restrictions on refugees. As for the restrictions, a bill passed in the House that is designed to increase screening of potential refugees from Iraq and Syria. The bill also called for certifications that ensure potential refugees are not a threat to the security of the United States. But it has stalled in the Senate. Two other House bills restricting the admission and resettlement of refugees have not been voted on either, so their outcome and support is still to be determined. We rate Priebus’ statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f40b918e-faf3-4f51-8678-fc939998891f	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2016-11-18T12:46:47	2016-11-14	['Syria']
pomt-02140	"There are over 200 documented cases where (Obama) has lied."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/06/wayne-rogers/former-mash-star-obama-lied-200-times/	Wayne Rogers of M*A*S*H fame -- he played "Trapper John" -- now investor and Fox News pundit, took a shot recently at President Barack Obama’s character. "He's not just willing to lie. He does it deliberately," Rogers said May 3, 2014, on the Fox News business program Cashin’ In. "There are over 200 documented cases where he has lied, you know, you can keep your plan if you like it. You can keep your doctor if you like it. Those are the obvious lies." That’s a lot of lying, and we wanted to learn more. We asked Rogers for his sources and did not hear from him. So we don’t know where he got the number but it seems likely he has read this: "252 Documented Examples of Barack Obama’s Lying, Lawbreaking, Corruption, Cronyism, etc.", a list on a website called Infowars.com. The title alone suggests Rogers may have gone overboard. At face value, the list gets to 252 by lumping "lies" in with a variety of other things (alleged lawbreaking, corruption, cronyism and the catch-all etc.). In fact, we looked at each item and about 225 came down to a difference of opinion over policy. Some examples on the policy front: Sent U.S. troops to Africa; made recess appointments when Congress was not in recess; had Freedom of Information Act record worse than Bush’s. The list includes 13 instances of what the author considered actual lying. PolitiFact declared the claim "If you like your plan, you can keep it," as the 2013 Lie of the Year (So we’ll give Rogers credit for that one.) For the rest, we take no position on whether the president verifiably misled the public but here are some items in that group (followed by our work): Lied about the cost of Obamacare; Falsely said that "we got back every dime" from the bailout; (PolitiFact New Hampshire rated Obama saying "We got back every dime used to rescue the banks" as Mostly True) Falsely said that Fast and Furious was started when George W. Bush was president. (PolitiFact rated Obama saying that Fast and Furious started when Bush was president as False) There are an additional 13 items on the list that seem more like broken promises than anything else. That portion of the list includes things like broke his promise to close Guantanamo Bay (PolitiFact has rated that promise Stalled), claimed he would wait five days before signing bills (PolitiFact has rated that Promise Broken), and broke his promise to pass immigration bill, and then lied about why he broke it (PolitiFact has rated several promises related to immigration). Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College and co-author of All the President’s Spin, does not put lying and broken promises in the same basket. "People may not be able to fulfill promises for reasons beyond their control and in any case it’s less ethically troubling to change your mind later than to say something that is misleading at the time that you say it," Nyhan said. "I’m opposed to the term ‘lie’ and have avoided using it in my work. It implies intention to mislead, which we can never know definitively." This Infowars.com article was expansive in its index of Obama’s transgressions and many items went beyond traditional policy disputes. In this category we found claims such as: had armed SWAT agents raid a law-abiding guitar factory because it was owned by a Republican; shut down an Amish farm; falsely claimed to know more about Judaism than any other president; and lied about being his ‘brother’s keeper.’ Trangessions? Maybe. Provable, documented lies? No. PolitiFact, by the way, has fact-checked Obama more than 500 times and found 77 of his claims to be rated either False or Pants on Fire. Neither rating indicates Obama lied, but you can see the rulings for yourself here. PolitiFact also is tracking more than 500 of Obama's campaign promises, 115 of which have been rated Promise Broken. A Promise Broken rating doesn't mean Obama lied, but you can review the promises for yourself here. Our ruling Rogers said "there are over 200 documented cases where (Obama) has lied." Rogers did not provide any proof, but it appears he got his information from an online list of 252 perceived transgressions by Obama that includes accusations of lying, broken promises, ethical lapses and objectionable policies. By our count, the article offered 13 instances of what the author saw and another 13 instancs of Obama breaking promises. In this fact-check, we're not verifying whether those 25-or-so cases constitute lies. But we can say with certainty that the "documented" total does not reach "over 200." Rogers' claim is ridiculously false. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Wayne Rogers	None	None	None	2014-05-06T17:05:05	2014-05-03	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-03208	Says an illegal immigrant fraudulently claimed children who actually lived in Mexico on income tax forms to collect more than $29,000.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/27/jack-kingston/lawmaker-uses-tax-credit-scam-drive-support-bill/	A Georgia congressman unveiled some disturbing details to bolster support for a bill he recently filed to stop illegal immigrants from receiving child tax credit refunds. "What has happened is that illegal aliens have been given the right to claim a child tax credit, and it's so bad that one guy in Indianapolis was discovered he had claimed 20 children and 19 of them lived back in Mexico — a cost of $29,000 a year to taxpayers," said U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah who is running for a U.S. Senate seat. Sound outrageous? PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether this is true? Did an Indianapolis man collect $29,000 from the federal government in tax credits for 19 children who live in Mexico? Kingston made the comments during an Aug. 1 interview with Newsmax TV, a conservative-leaning website. He has repeated the claim on his congressional website. The details we found showed some clarity is necessary in this case. On July 22, Kingston filed the bill, House Resolution 2278, in the House of Representatives. The legislation would require a parent or guardian to put a child’s name and other information on an income tax return to get the tax credit. The legislation was co-sponsored by 13 other House members, including Georgia Republicans Paul Broun (who is also running for the U.S. Senate) and Lynn Westmoreland. Kingston’s resolution was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. The Internal Revenue Service allows as much as $1,000 in tax credits for each child, depending upon the parent’s or guardian’s income. Currently, those child caregivers can submit their Social Security number or an individual tax identification number to get a credit. A nine-digit number issued by the IRS allows U.S. citizens and illegal immigrants to file tax returns. In September 2011, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Inspector General Office filed a report that the federal government paid $4.2 billion in 2010 to illegal immigrants who collected child tax credits. The Treasury Inspector General said in a news release that accompanied the report that the IRS and the Treasury Department need to clarify whether illegal immigrants should receive the credits. Kingston noted the report on his website. "An investigative reporter in Indianapolis, IN recently uncovered cases in which illegal immigrants were claiming the credit for relatives who did not even live in the United States," Kingston wrote. "One illegal immigrant interviewed admitted to claiming 20 children and collecting returns totaling $29,608. In reality only one child was observed to live at the residence while 19 others lived in Mexico and had never visited the United States." In 2012, Indianapolis television station WTHR aired an investigative report on illegal immigrants in that area receiving child tax credits. The reporter interviewed a man who said four illegal immigrants were using his address to file tax returns. "His address is being used to file tax returns by four undocumented workers who don’t even live here," the reporter said. "And what’s more? Those four claimed 20 children live inside this trailer home in Southern Indiana. And as a result, the IRS sent the illegal immigrants tax refunds totaling $29,608." WTHR’s story has been cited in several emails by people outraged by what the station reported. "This tax loophole dips right into YOUR pocket defrauding you ….. The honest taxpayer," according to one email with a weblink to the WTHR story that was posted on FactCheck.org. The reporter, Bob Segall, told PolitiFact Georgia that two of the four illegal immigrants who used the address were siblings of the man who lived there. The other two were friends. Segall said he was unaware of any other reports that one illegal immigrant in the Indianapolis area received more than $29,000 in child tax credits. A Treasury Department spokeswoman did not return a telephone call and email seeking comment. Chris Crawford, a spokesman for Kingston, offered us an explanation via email. "[H]is intent is clear here. This is an absolute waste of precious taxpayer resources that must be stopped whether it is one person or 100," Crawford said. "For the IRS to not only know but to have been repeatedly warned about this problem is absolutely outrageous." To sum up, Kingston said one illegal immigrant admitted claiming 20 children for child tax credits, although 19 of them lived in Mexico. The person, he said, received refunds totaling $29,608. Our findings showed that the congressman’s claim, made on his congressional website and in a television interview, was not entirely correct. Kingston’s dollar figure was accurate. But four illegal immigrants -- not one -- used someone’s address to collect money for the tax credits. We rate Kingston’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-10803	"I was the first presidential candidate to lay out a specific, truly universal health care plan."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/04/john-edwards/edwards-forgets-kucinich/	At a debate, John Edwards talked about his support for universal health care, capping it off by saying he was the first candidate to lay out a specific plan. That's true only if you don't count Dennis Kucinich. Yes, Kucinich is a long-shot candidate, but he's been promoting a fairly specific, universal health care plan since at least 2005 and arguably earlier. The Edwards' campaign responded to a question on this point by saying Edwards meant for the 2008 cycle. We suspect he likely was more focused on his closest rivals, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And he did beat those two to the health care punch by several months, introducing his plan in February 2007, while Obama introduced his in May and Clinton in September. Edwards' plan requires employers to cover employees or pay into a government fund so employees can buy their own insurance. It also creates regional health care markets so those people don't have to negotiate on their own with insurers. After that, the plan has an individual mandate requiring every person to be insured. Edwards pays for the plan through a combination of cost savings and tax increases on higher income levels. The Kucinich plan, on the other hand, is reflected in a piece of legislation he co-sponsored in the U.S. House. It was introduced in the House in 2005, though Kucinich supported an earlier version during his previous run for president in 2004. It would provide free health care for all, including primary care, prescription drugs, and mental health services. The plan would be paid for by cost savings and tax increases on the top 5 percent of income earners, an increased payroll tax, and taxes on stock and bond transactions.

pomt-01777	The state of New York is the "worst in the nation in economic recovery."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/28/rob-astorino/rob-astorino-gop-challenger-andrew-cuomo-says-ny-h/	Rob Astorino, the county executive of New York’s Westchester County, is the expected Republican nominee for governor this fall, facing the uphill challenge of unseating Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has led several recent polls by about 30 points. On July 25, 2014, Astorino appeared on Fox & Friends to tout his candidacy. Among other things, Astorino attacked his opponent’s economic record. "This is an uphill, but winnable race in New York," Astorino said. "... And we are worst in the nation in economic recovery, in outlook, in business climate, highest taxes, most corruption. We had 400,000 New Yorkers leave our state in three and a half years. So it is bad in New York, but it can get better beginning in January with a new governor." We decided to check whether Astorino was correct that New York is "worst in the nation in economic recovery." We looked at four widely used economic measures to see whether New York was really a bottom-dweller. We didn’t find the state at the bottom on any of them. Job growth New York ranked 17th in the nation in the percentage increase in jobs between June 2009 (the official end of the most recent recession) and June 2014 (the most recent month for which data is available), according to an Associated Press calculation of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Payroll employment in New York increased from 8.5 million to 9 million over that period -- a 6 percent jump, or exactly in line with the percentage for the United States as a whole. Current unemployment rate This statistic isn’t as favorable to New York, but the state isn’t dead last, either. Currently, New York’s unemployment rate is 6.6 percent, tied for the 36th best in the country, or roughly in the bottom quarter of states. That’s a bit worse than the national average of 6.1 percent. Decrease in the unemployment rate It’s much the same if you look at how far the state unemployment rate has fallen since June 2009. In New York, the unemployment rate has fallen by 1.9 percentage points, or tied for the 34th biggest drop among the 50 states over that period. Nationally, the drop in unemployment since June 2009 has been bigger than New York’s -- 3.4 percentage points for the nation as a whole. Inflation-adjusted growth in gross domestic product This statistic measures how much growth there’s been in a state’s total economic activity, accounting for inflation. New York’s GDP grew by 7 percent between June 2009 and June 2014, which ranked as the 30th biggest jump among the 50 states. This means that New York grew a bit more slowly than the nation as a whole over the same period; the national increase was about 9 percent. If you put it all together, these figures suggest that New York’s bounceback from the Great Recession has been below average compared to the other 49 states. But we see no support for calling New York’s economic performance "worst in the nation." The weakest of the statistics we looked at shows New York in the bottom quarter of states, while the best of the four we checked shows New York ranking well above average. When contacted by PolitiFact, a spokesman for Astorino's campaign said Astorino "misspoke." He had intended to say that upstate New York is ranked last in recovery -- not the whole state. There's certainly evidence that upstate New York is struggling -- for instance, Moody's has cited data that "indicate a stalling economic recovery in upstate New York"-- but given the available statistics, it's hard to do a national, apples-to-apples comparison to determine what region is faring the worst in the recovery. For the record, New Mexico had the weakest increase in jobs in the nation as well as the smallest decline in the unemployment rate, while Rhode Island and Mississippi tied for the worst current unemployment rate and Maine and Connecticut saw the smallest increase in inflation-adjusted state GDP. Our ruling Astorino said that New York state is the "worst in the nation in economic recovery." His staff now acknowledges that the candidate misspoke. He did have a point that several commonly used statistics suggest that New York’s recovery has been weaker than average among the 50 states. But that’s a far cry from "worst in the nation." We rate his claim False.	None	Rob Astorino	None	None	None	2014-07-28T14:17:39	2014-07-25	['New_York_City']
pomt-01107	"When Disney was looking to build Disney World, they came to Miami and we told Disney to take a hike."	false	/florida/statements/2015/jan/09/dennis-moss/disney-wanted-build-miami-dade-county-told-him-tak/	A battle over whether to turn a swath of trees near the Zoo Miami into an amusement park has touched off a debate about whether Disney decades ago wanted to build in Miami-Dade and whether county officials told Disney "to take a hike." County commissioners will consider declaring the area blighted at a March 3 hearing which could pave the way for developers to build a $930 million 20th Century Fox amusement park. Environmentalists vow to fight the plan. County Commissioner Dennis Moss, who has advocated for an amusement park in his district, told the Miami Herald that the land had been planned for redevelopment for years. And he says the county shouldn’t miss another opportunity to have an amusement park. "When Disney was looking to build Disney World, they came to Miami and we told Disney to take a hike, and they took a hike to Central Florida. You see the economic impact they had on Central Florida. We have a chance to do that with 20th Century Fox in our community," he said in a Dec. 19 article. His claim set off a flurry of letters to the editor by readers who debated whether Disney World considered Miami-Dade as a site and if local officials rejected it. Here’s one from prominent South Florida attorney Ben Kuehne: "I wonder who were the unidentified officials in then-Dade County who told Disney to ‘take a hike,’ when Disney does not seem to have ever expressed an interest in South Florida as a potential location for its Disney World attraction. To the contrary, official Disney history is that Disney particularly chose Central Florida in order to not compete with existing tourism areas on the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico. Is Moss trying to pull a fast one on the Miami-Dade residents in his haste to pursue a massive theme park development in his district, contending that we lost a nonexistent opportunity once and cannot afford to do so 50 years later?" But then Larry Capp, former executive director of the governmental entity Metro-Miami Action Plan during the 1980s, wrote a letter saying that Moss is correct. Capp’s information is based on conversations he had with the late County Mayor Stephen R. Clark in the 1980s. Clark "never deviated from his account that Disney wanted to come to Miami," Capp wrote. But the negotiations with the county commission fell apart when Disney demanded that the county pay for infrastructure, Capp wrote. He added that Disney had already acquired large parcels in the county in the area that is now Trump National Doral. (Clark, who has since died, was first elected to the Miami city commission in 1963 and later became county mayor.) Time to pull out PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter: Did Disney consider Miami-Dade and did county officials tell Disney to go take a hike? Take a wild ride with us as we try to separate the lore from the truth about the twists and turns in the development of Disney World. Moss uncertain of his source Moss, who was first elected in 1993, told PolitiFact Florida that he couldn’t recall any specific source for his claim. "I don’t have anything in writing," he said. But Moss pointed to Capp’s letter as "witness testimony." While it is certainly possible that during the 1980s Clark told Capp this information about Disney from decades ago, that’s not indisputable evidence in our book. County officials were unable to pinpoint any specific evidence to support Moss’ claim. Moss acknowledged it could be difficult to prove exactly what happened. "Disney is about fairy tales and storybook endings, so who knows what transpired back in the 1950s?" Historians on the alleged Miami-Dade option At PolitiFact we prefer history books to story books, so we interviewed several authors and historians who extensively researched the development of Disney World. None of them found evidence that Disney considered Miami-Dade. Disney hired leisure-time economics analyst Harrison "Buzz" Price to research Disney World locations. Price looked at several states and locations in Florida, but the closest one to Miami-Dade was in Palm Beach County, which Disney ultimately rejected. Price wrote in his book "Walt’s Revolution by the Numbers" about how Disney ultimately chose Orlando. "In 1961, after rejecting some other alternatives, Walt asked us to look at the rest of Florida and figure out where the park should be. Late in 1963, we studied in depth a location in Central Florida. The key conclusion was that central Florida (not Miami as most people expected it would be) was the main point of maximum intersection of Florida tourism, and that Orlando, centrally located, what's the point of maximum access to the southerly flow of Florida tourism from both the east and west shores of the state…" (Price has since died.) Disney announced the Orlando project in 1965, and the park opened in 1971. There were, however, Miami connections. When Disney acquired land in the Orlando area, Disney set up dummy corporations in Miami to hide that it was acquiring the property, said Disney Family Museum historian Paula Sigman Lowery. Disney was secretive about his plans as he was buying land because he didn’t want prices to skyrocket. Disney used Miami lawyer Paul Helliwell, who as a CIA agent had relocated to Miami in 1960 to carry out actions against Castro. Helliwell came up with the approach to create essentially fake cities for Disney World, wrote author T.D. Allman in Finding Florida. Five authors of books about Disney -- Rollins College professor Richard Foglesong, T.D. Allman, Sam Gennawey, Jim Korkis and Chad Emerson -- all told PolitiFact Florida that during their research they found no evidence that Disney considered Miami-Dade. "I say this from having extensively researched the Disney land-purchase story, based on research at the Disney archives in Burbank and a close reading of legal documents involving depositions of key Disney players as reported in a book published by Yale University Press and fact-checked to the smallest detail," Foglesong told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Foglesong added, "I can’t say that it’s not true, I can only say I did not find evidence to that claim." Experts told us that Disney did not want to build near the beach which would compete with his amusement park. But Korkis said that there are gaps in historical records which are based in part on oral history. "The Disney Archives was not created until 1970, and it stumbled for a decade trying to locate and organize papers, and even today there are huge gaps. When it comes to Disney history, there are things that the Imagineers refer to as ‘logical erroneous conclusions,’ things that sound reasonable but are completely wrong," he said. "Often, people sincerely believe something is true." Miami Herald researcher Monika Leal looked through two boxes of news clips from the newspaper in the 1960s about Disney World and found no reference to Disney considering Miami-Dade County. But wait a second .... There was a time when Miami politicians talked to Disney executives about building some type of attraction in the county, but it wasn’t Disney World, says Maurice Ferre, who was mayor of Miami from 1973 to 1985 The Miami Herald wrote multiple articles about Ferre’s push to bring an amusement park to Watson Island. Disney executives toured the Watson Island site in 1984, but in 1985, the Miami Herald reported that Disney rejected the idea. "What I wanted was to develop on Watson Island a mini-Disney park," Ferre told PolitiFact Florida. We asked Moss and Capp if the lore about Disney and Miami-Dade could be related to Watson Island in the 1980s, rather than the actual Disney World project in the 1960s. Moss said he wasn’t aware of the Watson Island project, however ,"What I heard was in reference to Disney World." "Gosh I really don’t know," Capp said. Mayor Clark "never mentioned Watson Island or anything downtown or the waterfront. He strictly said the Doral area. .... This is becoming quite a mystery." Our ruling Moss said, "When Disney was looking to build Disney World, they came to Miami and we told Disney to take a hike." At PolitiFact we believe that politicians need to back up their claims, and in this case Moss said he doesn’t have a documented source. The account by Capp that former Mayor Clark told him in the 1980s that this happened decades before doesn’t provide first-hand evidence. And it’s the only piece of evidence we found in favor of Moss’s point. The historians we interviewed said they had never seen evidence to support the claim that Disney considered Miami-Dade for Disney World. If we later find evidence that shows Disney considered Miami-Dade for Disney World, we will revisit this fact-check, but so far Moss has failed to prove his claim, so we rate it False.

pomt-11547	"George W. Bush doubled the debt from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. President Obama doubled the debt from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Now we're on course to exceed $30 trillion in the next seven years or so."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-gets-numbers-right-speech-federal-debt/	As the House and Senate were rushing to head off a government shutdown during a late-night session on Feb. 8, Sen. Rand Paul,. R-Ky., was doing everything he could to slow the rush to passing a new spending bill. In a lengthy floor speech, Paul took aim at lawmakers who wring their hands about the rising debt but then vote for legislation that adds red ink. At one point in his speech, Paul said, "George W. Bush doubled the debt from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. President Obama doubled the debt from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Now we're on course to exceed $30 trillion in the next seven years or so." We found that this assertion was largely accurate, but needs a few bits of context. The debt records of Bush and Obama Using the Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator, we were able to pinpoint the amount of debt created under each president. When Bush was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2001, the gross federal debt was $5.73 trillion. By the time he left office on Jan. 20, 2009, it was $10.63 trillion. So he’s on target with the numbers on Bush’s watch. As for Obama, the debt rose on his watch to $19.95 trillion. That’s not quite $20 trillion, but it’s awfully close. While Paul is basically right on the numbers, there is some nuance to add: • Paul is using one of two measures for debt, and it’s the larger of the two. He’s using gross federal debt, which includes debt not just held by the public, but also debt one part of the federal government owes to another part of the federal government. The debt figures would have been smaller if he’d only used publicly held debt, which is another commonly used measurement. • It’s an exaggeration to personalize the debt increase -- saying that Bush and Obama both "doubled" the debt. Other factors beyond presidential actions helped enable that doubling, including demographic factors, such as the aging of the Baby Boom; external events beyond the president’s control, including the Great Recession; and Congress’s actions in setting spending levels. Both presidents spent at least part of their terms with the opposing party controlling all or part of Congress. "Now we're on course to exceed $30 trillion in the next seven years or so." Officially, the CBO has not published this specific projection yet, but from what we can piece together, Paul has a point here, too. Even before the Republican-backed tax bill and the recent spending bill were enacted, the debt was set to soar. In its official projection from June 2017, the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’ nonpartisan number-crunching agency -- estimated that the debt would rise as follows: Year Gross federal debt at end of year 2018 $21.2 trillion 2019 $22.1 trillion 2020 $22.9 trillion 2021 $23.9 trillion 2022 $24.9 trillion 2023 $26.0 trillion 2024 $27.0 trillion 2025 $28.2 trillion 2026 $29.5 trillion 2027 $30.7 trillion If you consider "the next seven years or so" to be 2025, then the tax and spending bills passed in the past two months would have had to add an additional $1.8 trillion to the projected deficit to hit Paul’s $30 trillion debt figure by that year. Did they? The best estimates we can find say yes. For starters, the CBO released a letter after the tax bill was passed in December 2017 that said the debt held by the public would grow by a cumulative $1.65 trillion through 2025 as a result of the bill. (In this case, the CBO used publicly held debt, the smaller of the two debt measures.) So the tax bill alone would bring the debt level to at least $29.85 trillion by 2025. The spending bill appears to have put it over the top. A widely cited estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the spending bill would cost an additional $320 billion to the debt through 2027, and almost $420 billion if you include interest. Even if you pare that number a bit in order to count only the years through 2025, it should be enough to break the $30 trillion barrier in seven years, as Paul predicted. As with the other part of the statement, we have a caveat to add. While Paul voted against the spending bill, he did vote in favor of the tax bill. If he wished, Paul could have saved $1.65 trillion in debt through 2025 by voting against the bigger of the two debt-busting bills. But he didn’t. Paul’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Paul said, "George W. Bush doubled the debt from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. President Obama doubled the debt from $10 trillion to $20 trillion. Now we're on course to exceed $30 trillion in the next seven years or so." Paul is essentially right on all of the numbers. That said, his comment was wrong to personalize the cause of the debt increases. While Bush and Obama played a role in the increase in the federal debt on their watch, so did other factors, including demographics, external events, and congressional actions driven by the other party.

pomt-01081	Tampa Bay is "leading the state in jobs creation."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/jan/15/bob-buckhorn/tampa-bay-area-leads-florida-job-creation-buckhorn/	In a commercial running on Tampa cable television, Mayor Bob Buckhorn’s re-election campaign claims "we’re leading the state in jobs creation." Buckhorn said the "we" in this case is the entire Tampa Bay area, not just his city or Hillsborough County alone. "I always say Tampa Bay whenever I use that," Buckhorn told PolitiFact Florida in an interview on Jan. 13, 2015. "I’ve been saying ‘we’ for four years. This is not just about Tampa’s success. It’s about the bay area’s success. … It’s a ‘we’ proposition, not a ‘me’ proposition." Buckhorn has worked to streamline development regulation at City Hall, and tries to build confidence about the bay area, extolling its virtues and setting an upbeat tone. But any mayor has a limited ability to influence job growth. Economic trends beyond the control of city executives alone tend to dictate whether jobs are created or lost. And the Tampa Bay area’s experience in the last year demonstrates that those trends can change direction. This time last year, the Tampa Bay area led all Florida metros in adding jobs over the previous year, with 35,400 new jobs in the 12 months that ended in December 2013. That changed in 2014, according to labor statistics from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. Through November, the most recent month for which figures are available, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area had created 12,900 jobs over a 12-month period. That put it in a tie for fifth place among Florida metro areas with West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Boynton Beach, which also created 12,900 jobs in a local workforce that is less than half the size of the Tampa Bay area’s. In 2014, the top four metro areas for job creation were Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford (46,300 new jobs in the 12 months ending in November), Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall (39,500 jobs), Ft. Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-Deerfield Beach (28,400 jobs) and Jacksonville (17,000 jobs). Taking a longer view, the picture looks better for the Tampa Bay area. From April 2010 to April 2014, the bay area added 134,346 jobs, more than in the Orlando, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Jacksonville and West Palm Beach metro areas. From April 2011, the month that Buckhorn took office as mayor, through April 2014, Orlando produced more jobs, with the Tampa Bay area close behind. Buckhorn’s commercial says "we’re leading the state in jobs creation." That was true for several years, but over last year the trends changed. Tampa is no longer leading the state in job creation. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Bob Buckhorn	None	None	None	2015-01-15T18:21:25	2015-01-15	['None']
pomt-14413	Foreign aid "is less than 1 percent of our federal budget."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/11/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-foreign-aid-less-1-percent-federa/	Florida has the highest percentage of senior citizens in the United States, so Social Security was one of the big topics during the March 10 Republican debate in Miami. Most candidates spoke of how they would modify the program when discussing the balance sheet for Social Security. Donald Trump, though, suggested the United States cut back on foreign aid and other military spending in order to keep Social Security solvent. Marco Rubio said he often hears people argue that a lot of taxpayer money can be saved by cutting back on foreign aid. That’s not reality, though. "I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget," Rubio said. "We can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse. Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up." We wanted to fact-check whether foreign aid is less than 1 percent of the federal budget. The amount the United States spends on foreign aid depends on who is doing the tally, as a 2011 Congressional Research Service report explained. Different agencies include different elements when they calculate what the United States spends on foreign aid. We'll use 2013 as an example, the most recent year for all four sources. • The federal budget only includes programs that fall under the International Affairs section of the budget, specifically sections 151 and 152. It says $32.5 billion was spent in 2013. • The U.S. Overseas Loans & Grants database, also known as the "Greenbook," developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) uses a broader definition. The latest Greenbook lists the United States as giving $31.9 billion in total economic assistance and $8 billion in total military assistance that year, for a total of $39.9 billion. • The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an organization of 34 developed countries, measures foreign aid by calendar year and excludes all military assistance. It says the United States spent $31.3 billion in "official developmental assistance." • And the CRS has its own total that includes "foreign operations" plus food aid, usually found in the agriculture section of the budget. It pegged the amount at $35.74 billion. So the range goes from $31.3 billion to $39.9 billion. On a total federal budget of just under $3.5 trillion, that's 0.9 percent to less than 1.2 percent. In addition, we found multiple reports that put the figure in the ballpark of what Rubio mentioned. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote in 2015 that "foreign aid represents a total of 0.7 percent of the budget, or 1 percent if military aid is included. That means fully eliminating foreign aid would save only $35 billion or $40 billion per year – a very small fraction of projected annual deficits." That’s not much different than historical figures. A Congressional Research Service report in 2011 stated that foreign assistance spending represents about 3 percent of the discretionary budget authority and just over 1 percent of total budget authority each year since 1977. For the 2010 fiscal year, foreign assistance totaled $39.4 billion, or 1.1 percent of the budget, To further complicate things, these tallies usually don't include non-traditional foreign aid, where other United States agencies engage in activities that most people would put under the category of foreign aid, such a joint research on pollution in other countries conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency. "It is estimated that these non-traditional sources of assistance equaled about $12.6 billion" during the 2009 fiscal year, according to the CRS report. That would have raised the total actually spent on foreign aid to $47.5 billion. Our ruling Rubio said foreign aid "is less than 1 percent of our federal budget." Several reports put the amount of foreign aid in the ballpark of what Rubio said at the GOP debate -- and it has been consistently in the single digits or less. We rate this claim True. Editor’s note: We updated this story on March 14, 2016, with additional information from the U.S. Overseas Loans & Grants database. The rating remains the same.

pomt-11504	Says NRA head Wayne LaPierre said, "We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America’s schools. Period."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/23/everytown-gun-safety/did-nras-lapierre-once-call-gun-free-schools/	Just about a week after the deadly shooting at a Florida high school, the National Rifle Association’s vice president Wayne LaPierre delivered the group’s response: more armed guards in schools. "Our banks, our airports, our NBA games, our NFL games, our office buildings, our movie stars, our politicians — they are all more protected than our children at school," Lapierre said at the Conservative Political Action Committee Feb. 22. "To stop a bad guy with a gun, it takes a good guy with a gun." LaPierre had barely stepped down from the stage when the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted this blast from LaPierre’s past. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The group quoted LaPierre as saying in 1999, "We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools.That means no guns in America’s schools. Period." There are a few angles to consider here. Did LaPierre say those words? Yes, he did. It was May 1, 1999, 10 days after two teenage boys killed 13 people, wounded more than 20 others and then committed suicide at Columbine High School in Colorado. LaPierre spoke at the NRA’s annual convention and called for a policy banning guns from school. But LaPierre said more than what the Everytown group quoted. He was talking about guns brought to school by students, not teachers or trained security. "Of the 6,000 young people the president acknowledges were caught with a gun at school during the past two years, we believe all of them should have been prosecuted," LaPierre said. "But the truth is only five were prosecuted in 1997. And just eight were prosecuted in 1988. That's not zero tolerance." LaPierre made a passing reference to armed guards in schools, referring to "the rare exception of law enforcement officers or trained security personnel." As for arming teachers, something President Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in, LaPierre said nothing. In his 1999 speech, his emphasis was on what adults should do to keep weapons out of the hands of teens. LaPierre said the NRA held adults responsible. "Just as every kid should have a guardian who knows where he is and keeps him safe, every firearm should have a guardian who knows where it is and keeps it safely stored," LaPierre said. The debate has shifted Columbine horrified the nation in its scale and the cold-blooded method of the high school seniors who had spent a year planning their attack. The Senate passed a bill to strengthen background checks, but it died in the House. The slaughter prompted more discussion of early identification of loners, and more emphasis on school security. Keeping weapons out of the hands of minors gained more attention. The 2012 shootings in Newtown, Conn., that took the lives of 26 elementary students and one of their teachers was the signature event when LaPierre spoke forcefully about a good guy with a gun being the best response to a bad guy with a gun. His rhetoric in 2012 was the same as when he spoke in 2018. "American airports, office buildings, power plants, courthouses, even sports stadiums are all protected by armed security," LaPierre said at a news conference Dec. 21, 2012. "Yet, when it comes to our most beloved, innocent, and vulnerable members of the American family, our children, we as a society leave them every day utterly defenseless." In 2012, LaPierre called on Congress to immediately "appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation." Our ruling Everytown for Gun Safety tweeted the reminder that nearly two decades ago, LaPierre said, "We believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America’s schools. Period." The quotation is accurate, but it takes LaPierre’s words out of context. His full message was that adults should keep weapons out of the hands of minors and that schools and localities should act swiftly to punish any student caught bringing a firearm to school. In 1999, LaPierre also left open the door for armed security on school grounds, but that was not the focus of the policy debate at the time. That option has since risen on the NRA’s agenda. The Everytown tweet has a measure of truth, but it leaves out important context that changes the meaning behind LaPierre’s words. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13744	Says Trump shirts are made in Bangladesh, Trump suits in Mexico, Trump Vodka in the Netherlands, Trump crystal barware in Slovenia and his cufflinks and ties in China.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/jul/25/funny-or-die/fact-checking-funny-or-die-video-about-trump-brand/	Bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States is a cornerstone of Donald Trump’s campaign. But comedy actor Ken Jeong and former White House economist Austan Goolsbee pointed out an apparent hypocrisy in a Funny Or Die video shown at the Democratic National Convention: Many Trump-branded products are made overseas. The video starts out with Jeong praising Trump’s businesses: "Yeah, you make stuff right here!" Then Goolsbee, who served in President Barack Obama’s administration responds, "He didn’t do that." Goolsbee and Jeong then go through a series of Trump-brand products — shirts, neckties, suits, cufflinks, vodka and glassware — to see where they were made. By the end, an exasperated Jeong says, "So Austan, if that is your real name, Donald Trump says he would bring back jobs to America when he himself made millions outsourcing his own Donald Trump stuff to be made everywhere else." "That is a pretty astute observation, Ken." We decided to go through their list of Trump products and check the "made in" labels. We found many of the products through Trump’s website, which has a page for the Donald J. Trump Collection, which includes suits, accessories and eyewear. We then explored the country for origin for each one. Claim: Trump shirts are made in Bangladesh. We found Trump shirts on Amazon that were made in Bangladesh and China, as well as some listed simply as "imported." Claim: Trump neckties are made in China. We saw a "made in China" label on a Trump tie for sale on eBay. Claim: Trump suits are made in Mexico. We actually found quite a few Trump suits on Amazon that were made in the United States. But we also found ones made in India and China. We couldn’t immediately find an example of a suit made in Mexico for sale, but Trump has acknowledged he has made some of his clothing line there. (Update: After we published this fact-check, the Clinton campaign sent us an example of an individual who posted a picture on Facebook of a Trump suit with a "made in Mexico" label. Claim: Trump cufflinks are made in China. We found some cufflinks that were made in China and others listed as imported. Claim: Trump Vodka is made in the Netherlands. Yes, Trump Vodka was distilled there, according to online liquor sellers. Claim: Trump crystal barware is made in Slovenia. Slovenian glassware producer Steklarna Rogaška partnered with Trump to sell their product under his name in the United States. Trump’s wife is also from Slovenia, which prompted Jeong to cry out her name: "Holy Melania!" But not all Trump products are made overseas. In a previous fact check, we found Trump-brand bedding, cologne, Trump Natural Spring Water and Trump Wine are all made in the United States. And if you’re wondering, some Trump products also are made in the United States, including the candidate’s iconic "Make America Great Again" baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. We gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a claim made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China. It’s worth noting, too, that 97 percent of all clothes sold in the United States are made overseas, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. Our ruling The Funny or Die video said Trump shirts are made in Bangladesh, Trump suits in Mexico, Trump Vodka in the Netherlands, Trump crystal barware in Slovenia and his cufflinks and ties in China. We found examples of all of these products made in the countries Jeong and Goolsbee mentioned, with the exception of a suit made in Mexico. But we did find suits made in other countries, and there are examples of other Trump clothing products made in Mexico. Some suits, in fact, are made in the United States.

pomt-04265	Says "I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/11/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-again-he-was-first-governor-/	When it comes to presidential campaigns, it seems almost no one was as supportive of Mitt Romney for president than Gov. Chris Christie. The Republican governor spent the past year crisscrossing the country to stump for Romney, a Republican. President Barack Obama defeated Romney in Tuesday’s election, and many have mentioned Christie as a possible presidential contender for 2016. One might think Christie was the first politician to stand up for Romney, given a claim that Christie repeated Wednesday during a press conference in Harvey Cedars. While there to discuss preparations for a nor’easter about to hit the state, Christie answered a question about praising Obama’s response in helping New Jersey in the wake Hurricane Sandy. Christie also dismissed questions about his loyalty to Romney after the widely publicized image of his extended handshake with Obama during the president’s Oct. 31 visit to tour hurricane damage along the Jersey Shore. "I’m a guy who tells the truth, all the time. And if the president of the United States did something good, I was going to say he did something good and give him credit for it," Christie said, according to a Nov. 7 story on the New York Post’s website. "But it doesn’t take away for a minute the fact that I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney, that I traveled literally tens of thousands of miles for him, raised tens of millions of dollars for him and worked harder, I think, than any other surrogate in America other than Paul Ryan," he continued. Christie’s "a guy who tells the truth, all the time"? Not quite. For this fact check we’re focusing on the claim that Christie was the first governor in the country to endorse Romney because he’s made the claim several times and received a False on the Truth-O-Meter for it. And this isn’t the first time, either, that Christie has repeated claims proven false. Let’s go back to Aug. 28, when Christie said on "CBS this Morning" about Romney that "I’ve spent since October of last year -- first governor in America to endorse him -- (running) around the country to 15 different states campaigning for him and raising money." We determined in a September fact-check that Christie was one of the first Republican governors to endorse Romney, but he wasn’t the first. After announcing he wouldn’t make a presidential run himself, Christie traveled to New Hampshire and endorsed Romney on Oct. 11, 2011. But a couple of other governors threw their support behind Romney first. The Romney campaign announced Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman’s endorsement in a June 10, 2011 news release posted on its website. On July 2, an article on the Washington Post’s website said, "Romney has been endorsed by two governors, Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Butch Otter of Idaho, as well as one former governor, Colorado’s Bill Owens." A Politico article on July 16, 2011 pointed out how only a few governors -- including Heineman and Otter -- had given endorsements in the GOP presidential primary race. A Dec. 1 article in the New York Times stated that Heineman was identified as "the first governor to endorse Mr. Romney." So while Christie’s support for Romney is clear, it’s also clear that he was not the first governor to endorse him for president. Christie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Christie was one of the most ardent supporters of Romney for president and stated several times in recent months that "I was the first governor in America to endorse Mitt Romney." The Truth-O-Meter gave the governor a False on this claim in September, noting that Heineman was the first, followed by Otter, to endorse Romney. Consistently supporting a candidate for president is one thing. But consistently repeating a false claim about being the first governor in the country to endorse that candidate is ridiculous.

pomt-09032	"There are mechanisms in place to shut down the Internet privately."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/06/andrew-napolitano/glenn-beck-host-says-obama-may-soon-be-able-shut-d/	We've gotten a lot of e-mails from readers asking us to weigh in on the claim that President Barack Obama may soon be able to use a "kill switch" to shut down and take over the Internet. The rumors, which are spreading like wildfire through the technology blogosphere, are tied to a bill currently pending in Congress that would allow the president to implement "short-term emergency measures" to protect the United States from a cyber attack. Discussion about the bill came up on a June 28, 2010, segment of the Glenn Beck show, guest-hosted by Judge Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News contributor. Napolitano argued that the bill is a "power grab" by the government, and that private companies are more than capable of protecting themselves against cyber-attacks. "There are mechanisms in place to shut down the Internet privately," said Napolitano. We wondered whether Napolitano is right that private Internet providers have it all under control. First, however, a little primer on cyber attacks. The most common are "penetration attacks" and "denial of service" attacks. The former consist of an unauthorized individual or group accessing a computer network. The latter entails crippling system functionality, which can result in a network shutdown. As an example, malicious hackers can take entire websites offline by generating so many access requests that the server comes to a halt. In August 2009, hackers used a denial of service attack to temporarily bring down Twitter. We should note that "shutting down the Internet" is just one of the many ways to respond to a cyber attack, and probably not the best one at that. Michael Locasto, a computer security expert from University of Calgary, told us that in most cases, eliminating the Internet infrastructure "would be the absolute worst course of action system defenders could take," since it would make it much more difficult to coordinate efforts against a large-scale threat. A much better option would be to filter certain kinds traffic that was deemed harmful, said Mark Rasch, a technology expert and a former Department of Justice attorney. That may be what Napolitano had in mind when he made the claim, but the wording of his statement makes it seem as though service providers could just take every network in the country offline and the problem would be solved. Beyond that, the several experts we spoke with agreed that it is technologically possible for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to significantly limit the flow of Internet traffic. "If 'shutting down the Internet' means denying network access to everyone outside the U.S., or to everyone inside the U.S., then there is no fundamental scientific or technological barrier to achieving it," said Steven Low, professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology. Although the Internet consists of tens of thousands of computer networks, the core infrastructure is largely controlled by a few large providers, so-called Tier-1 ISPs. If these providers decided to stop routing Internet traffic or dropped connections with their peers, we'd see major disruptions in connectivity. There are, however, a few caveats. First, experts disagree on how difficult it would be for service providers to coordinate with one another during a widespread cyber attack. "We've never had a widespread cyber attack against the U.S., and no one has ever had to coordinate any response to such an event. In fact, it isn’t clear we have any proper response strategy as a nation," said Salvatore Stolfo from Columbia University. Michael Locasto told us that the network operator community is fairly tight-knit, so "it is conceivable that (network operators) could coordinate a response to a major event and terminate basic connectivity within a matter of minutes." Network operators who maintain the Internet backbone share cell phone information, have regular meetings, and often work together through established channels in emergencies. Still, such a move would necessarily involve coordination by many people and groups. By design, the Internet does not have any form of "central authority." During an attack, private providers, who are often required by legal contracts to supply Internet access, would have to jointly agree to cut service. Some of our experts said that an attempt to put large segments of the Internet offline would most likely require some form of political and military involvement, not to mention corporate approval. "I don't think that it can be done without some kind of government mandate (or) state of emergency," Christopher Kruegel of University of California Santa Barbara said. Additionally, government agencies and the military use Internet networks that are only loosely connected to the wider network available to the public to browse websites and send e-mail. These limited-access networks are owned by private companies, but the providers are under strict contracts and regulation. So any attempt to cut off those connections would almost certainly require government involvement. Napolitano claimed that "there are mechanisms in place to shut down the Internet privately." The experts we spoke with told us that it is technically possible for large service providers to severely limit Internet connectivity. Moreover, there are both formal and informal channels for network operators who manage the Internet backbone to communicate with each other in times of emergencies. Still, there was disagreement among our experts on how difficult it would be for ISPs to coordinate with one another and whether the government would have to get involved. It is clear, however, that the government would have to participate in order to shut down its own networks, and there is an argument to be made that "shutting down the Internet" might hurt the response to a cyber attack more than it would help.

pomt-11556	Many gang members have taken advantage of "glaring loopholes and our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied, alien minors."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/07/donald-trump/immigration-ms-13-and-crime-facts-behind-donald-tr/	President Donald Trump linked illegal immigration to the violence of the MS-13 gang, claiming "open borders" have caused the death of many people in the United States. During his State of the Union speech, Trump highlighted the 2016 killings of teenagers Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens in New York and the related murder charges against MS-13 members. "These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders," Trump said Jan. 30. "Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes and our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied, alien minors. And wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school." The U.S. Justice Department did not specify in a 2017 press release on the indictments if the defendants charged for the murders of Cuevas and Mickens came to the United States illegally as unaccompanied minors. We asked the department to clarify, but it referred us to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which did not provide a response by deadline. PolitiFact decided to fact-check whether gang members have taken advantage of "glaring loopholes" and laws to come in as unaccompanied minors, as Trump claimed. The White House did not provide on-the-record information to back Trump’s claim. It’s unclear exactly how many gang members have come to the United States as unaccompanied minors, but federal authorities have identified a small number as suspected or confirmed gang members. Nevertheless, what Trump refers to as "loopholes" are actually specific protections for undocumented minors called for by law. Some of these minors are actually fleeing gang violence in their own countries. Finally, experts note that unaccompanied minors are vulnerable to gang recruitment after their arrival to the United States. Here’s a closer look at the complex issue. Background on MS-13 gang and its U.S. presence La Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, grew out of poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. The Justice Department said the name Mara Salvatrucha comes from the word "mara," a term in El Salvador for gang, "salva," short for "Salvadoran," and "trucha," a slang term for "alert," "look out," or "cunning." The 13 refers to "M" — the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, denoting allegiance to the prison gang Mexican Mafia. MS-13’s motto is "kill, rape and control," Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said. The Trump administration says there are more than 10,000 MS-13 gang members across 40 U.S. states and more than 30,000 worldwide. Experts have told us that the growth of MS-13 in the United States is related to draconian policies in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that pushed many gang members out of Central America. In the United States, law enforcement officials have indicted MS-13 members for a wide range of crimes, including murders, attempted murders, assaults, obstruction of justice, arson, and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Surge of unaccompanied minors coming to the United States Waves of unaccompanied minors, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, have come to the United States illegally in recent years fleeing gang violence and poverty. Southwest border apprehensions of unaccompanied minors peaked in 2014 at 68,541. Around 41,400 of them were apprehended in fiscal year 2017, a 31 percent decrease from fiscal year 2016, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Unaccompanied Alien Child is the legal term for an individual who does not have a lawful immigration status in the United States; is under 18 years old; and has no parent or legal guardian in the United States, or for whom no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody. ‘Glaring loopholes’ in the law for illegal entry? Trump has previously claimed that "loopholes" prevent the deportation of unaccompanied minors. That’s Mostly False. The "loopholes" he has referred to are matters explicitly called for in the law. Unaccompanied minors from contiguous countries (Mexico and Canada) can be quickly returned to their countries; but unaccompanied minors from other countries are not immediately sent back, but rather placed in formal removal proceedings and can apply for asylum. Individuals can seek asylum if they have suffered persecution or fear they will suffer persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Regarding Trump’s "glaring loopholes" and gangs claim, we asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its agencies for data on unaccompanied minors who have sought asylum in the United States while belonging to MS-13 or other gangs at time of entry. None provided information. Immigration experts told us that while gang members can apply for asylum, it would be difficult for them to receive it. "If the gang member persecuted others or committed a serious crime in the United States or his country of origin, he would likely be barred from asylum," said Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law. "Most of the asylum seekers we see are fleeing gangs or refused to join a gang. It is also very difficult for them to obtain asylum in the United States because they don't fit easily into one of the five grounds for asylum," Marouf said. Are gang members coming into the United States as unaccompanied minors? According to June 2017 written testimony from U.S. Border Patrol Acting Chief Carla Provost, since fiscal year 2012 U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 159 unaccompanied alien children with confirmed or suspected gang affiliations. Of the 159 children, 56 were suspected or confirmed to be affiliated with MS-13, according to Provost. (Around 45,400 unaccompanied minors, on average, were apprehended per fiscal year from 2012 to 2017.) Provost’s testimony did not break down how many unaccompanied minors were confirmed to be gang members and how many were suspected. "The language of ‘suspected’ is important because DHS’s internal enforcement, ICE, has alleged gang membership or affiliation against a number of Central American immigrants without substantiating these allegations at all," said Saba N. Ahmed, a clinical instructor in the Immigration and Human Rights Clinic at the University of the District of Columbia, David A. Clarke School of Law. "In fact, in the very recent class action case of Saravia, arising out of Operation Matador activity in New York, a federal circuit judge ordered the government to substantiate these allegations, and they could not," Ahmed said. Conflating "suspected" and "confirmed" exaggerates the gang problem in the United States, said Sonja Wolf, a researcher with the Drug Policy Programme at the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE), a think tank in Mexico. "Not all unaccompanied minors get involved in gangs, and not all gang members are undocumented immigrants but were often born in the United States," Wolf said. ICE has reported that operations targeting gang members have led to the arrests of individuals who came as unaccompanied minors. But it’s unclear if they arrived as gang members or joined gangs after coming to the United States. Unaccompanied minors recruited by MS-13 after their arrival Experts on immigration, gangs and criminal networks, and law enforcement have said unaccompanied minors are clearly targets for MS-13 recruitment. Timothy D. Sini, then-Commissioner of the Suffolk County Police Department in New York (now the county’s district attorney), told a Senate committee in May 2017 that unaccompanied minors are vulnerable to recruitment because they are young, unaccompanied, adjusting to a new country, culture and language, and seek a sense of belonging. "While the overwhelming majority of these children live law-abiding lives, (unaccompanied alien children) are undoubtedly a source of recruitment for MS-13," Sini said. Of a sampling of 156 active gang members in Suffolk County, Sini said 39 were unaccompanied minors. "It is not entirely clear, however, the percentage of (unaccompanied alien children) who came into the United States as MS-13 gang members, were recruited while in federal custody or were preyed upon once they reached Suffolk," Sini said. In testimony to the same committee, Scott Michael Conley, a detective in the Chelsea Police Department in Massachusetts, said that while the majority of unaccompanied minors were fleeing violence, "the smallest group of unaccompanied minors are ‘homeboys’ being sent by the gang to bolster the ranks of MS cliques operating in the United States." Conley presented a recruitment scenario when gang members and minors who are not in gangs travel in the same group to the United States. Gang members gather information from non-gang members, such as where they lived and who their relatives are, and later use that information to recruit them. Those who refuse to join are subject to assaults or threats that their relatives will be killed, Conley said. MS-13 also exploits human smuggling organizations to bring unaccompanied minors to the United States, said Angel M. Melendez, a Special Agent in Charge for ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations in New York, during a House committee hearing in 2017. "Illicit pathways go hand-in-hand with MS-13 increasing its membership," Melendez said. "Once these children are smuggled into the United States, they become prime targets for enlistment into the gang." Immigrants less prone to crime, despite claims from Trump administration Overall, several studies have found that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born individuals. Central American immigrant youth — both children and adults — are not only vulnerable to MS-13 threats, extortion, recruitment, but also are almost always their primary targets and victims, said Ahmed, from the University of the District of Columbia's David A. Clarke School of Law. "DHS, Sessions, and Trump are trying to shift the focus of immigration enforcement to MS-13 in order to repeatedly drill in the message that immigrants are dangerous criminals," Ahmed said. But many gang members were born in the United States, and gangs form in conditions of marginality, which also exist in other countries, said Wolf, the researcher with CIDE in Mexico. "There is no doubt that MS-13 has engaged in serious and heinous forms of violence, devastating families and communities. But the emphasis on immigrants as the source of the gang problem in the United States is misguided," said David C. Pyrooz, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Colorado Boulder, whose research includes gangs and criminal networks. While evidence suggests that immigrants are less likely to be in gangs than native-born youth, Pyrooz said, MS-13 is "the perfect boogeyman, owing to their ethnicity, transnationality, and extreme violence." "The problem is that the constant callouts from the highest office in the land are giving MS-13 the notoriety that they could never achieve on their own accord," he said. Our ruling Trump said many gang members have taken advantage of "glaring loopholes and our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied, alien minors." What Trump in the past has referred to as "loopholes" are requirements explicitly called for in the law. It’s also uncertain how many gang members have come to the United States as unaccompanied minors, but some law enforcement officials said some have. Experts note unaccompanied minors are vulnerable to recruitment after their arrival to the United States. In many cases, these minors are the victims of the gangs rather than perpetrators of crime.

pomt-13673	"We rank 38th in wages. ... (Rick Scott) goes out around the country and advertises that to other states."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/aug/03/gwen-graham/gwen-graham-says-rick-scott-boasts-about-floridas-/	A Donald Trump presidency would be as bad for America as Gov. Rick Scott has been for Florida, U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham said to delegates at the Democratic National Convention. At a Florida delegation breakfast on July 28, Graham compared the Republican presidential nominee to former businessman Scott, saying they were both from the "con-man wing" of the GOP. She said Scott has stunted Florida’s economy by keeping it a low-wage state. "After six years, we’re now the third most populous state, but we rank 38th in wages," said Graham, the daughter of former Florida Gov. Bob Graham. "Scott's actually proud of how low they are. He goes out around the country and advertises that to other states." We wondered if Floridians really earned so little, and whether Scott was so proud of low wages that he was using it as a selling point for other states. We found Graham was tripped up by details for both parts of this claim. Low for a reason Let’s start with that number 38. Graham’s office told us was from Census data from the 2011 American Community Survey ranking median household income. The first thing to know about that is the figure is out of date. The latest data from the 2014 survey show Florida has actually regressed to 40th. The second thing to know is that median household income, economists told us, isn’t the same as wages. Wages are a stand-in term for what we’d consider a rate of payment for a unit of time, usually measured in hours. Income can include things like social security, capital gains, rent, dividends and interest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics records wage estimates based on several different occupations. The state’s median and mean hourly wages for all occupations clocks in at $15.29 and $20.60, respectively, trailing the national median and mean of $17.40 and $23.23. Moody’s senior economist Chris Lafakis used the agency’s Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, and said Florida ranks 30th by that measure. A big reason for that is because Florida’s tourism-based economy is filled with low-skilled jobs that just don’t pay all that well. Meanwhile, the cost of living here is marginally lower than the national average, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Taxes, not wages Scott’s refrain for the past six years has been about creating jobs as the state recovered from recession. One of Scott’s methods has been to try to steal jobs from other states (and not necessarily very high-paying ones). When we reviewed Scott’s statements from these recruiting missions — to places like Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Illinois — we found he did focus quite a bit on the state’s low taxes for businesses. The lack of state income tax also was a major highlight of sales pitches. A Graham spokesman said she was specifically referring to a radio ad that ran in California during Scott’s trip there in May 2016. The commercial attacked California’s recent move to raise the minimum wage to $15, while touting Florida’s growing economy. "Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage," said the ad from Enterprise Florida, the state’s public-private economic development arm chaired by Scott. "Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead — no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them." PolitiFact Florida previously researched whether California stood to lose 700,000 jobs because of the wage increase and rated the statement Mostly False. We learned the figure was a projection of how many jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn’t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said the ad wasn’t Scott bragging about low wages, but rather him pointing out differences between the states’ economies. "He has never said he is proud of how low our wages are," Schutz said. It’s possible to argue Scott’s comparison is inferring Florida is benefitting precisely because it’s not raising wages like California. He has certainly been accused of talking up Florida’s low wages, even though he doesn’t explicitly say it. "By raising the minimum wage in California, 700,000 people are going to lose their jobs, there are a lot of opportunities for companies to prosper in Florida and compete here and that’s what I’m going after," Scott told the Los Angeles Times in May. But that strikes us more as saying California is going too high, not necessarily talking up that Florida is staying too low. Keep in mind that Florida’s minimum wage of $8.05 per hour is already higher than the federally mandated $7.25 an hour, and is pegged to inflation by law. Experts told us companies weigh many factors when deciding whether to relocate. Businesses usually are more concerned with how well a labor pool will perform for the compensation they receive. "That doesn’t mean ‘cheap’ workers, but workers that represent a good value (how productive workers are relative to the cost of hiring workers)," Rollins College economics professor Bill Seyfried said in an email. Florida also is not the only state faced with lackluster wage growth. Tina Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, said trying to increase purchasing power is a global problem. She cited an Indeed Hiring Lab report that said real wage growth is lagging overall. "Only 16 percent of jobs today are both high-paying and saw wage growth at least matching inflation over the past 10 years," she said. Our ruling Graham said, "We rank 38th in wages. ... (Rick Scott) goes out around the country and advertises that to other states." There are issues with the figure she used, which is both outdated and an improper reading of how wages are calculated. But while there’s no question Florida’s wages are low by national standards, it doesn’t appear Scott has boasted (at least publicly) about this fact while recruiting businesses from other states.

pomt-05208	Says "we are overcharging students . . . to help pay for the health care law."	half-true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jun/10/lamar-alexander/sen-lamar-alexander-says-students-overcharged-loan/	The health care law that passed in 2010 and which most Republicans say they’d like to scrap has hundreds of provisions, including new sources of revenue to pay for expanded coverage. Recently, some politicians have made the case that the new law is being paid for in part by using the savings created when Congress took private banks and the subsidies they received out of the business of making guaranteed loans to students. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the Secretary of Education under the first President Bush, took to the Senate floor in May to claim, "We are overcharging students . . . by $8.7 billion to pay for the health care law." We decided to look at whether that’s correct. Alexander’s office declined our request for further clarification of his position. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio tested a similar claim by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and concluded his statement was Half True. PolitiFact New Hampshire also examined an even more expansive statement from Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, and ruled it Mostly False. The major elements of those items apply here, as well. As you’ve seen in recent years, the Senate is so divided that not a lot gets done until one side or the other can reach the filibuster threshold of 60 votes to move a bill to a floor vote. The exception to that rule is a bill reconciling a budget bill with an existing budget resolution, which requires only a majority vote of 51 of 100 senators. That’s how the Reconciliation Act of 2010, changing both student loans and health care, passed the Senate in March of that year with just 56 votes. Making direct student loans and cutting out the subsidized middle man -- private banks -- was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to save $58 billion over ten years. To make a long and convoluted history shorter, $36 billion of that savings was set aside for additional Pell grants, and an additional $3 billion went to other education programs, including historically black colleges and universities. That left roughly $19 billion in savings. Some $10 billion of that was set aside for debt reduction. That leaves roughly $9 billion. That’s where Alexander’s $8.7 billion figure comes from. Alexander’s floor speech was intended to persuade his colleagues to use some of that $8.7 billion, currently set aside for elements of the public health fund created by the health reform act, to pay for keeping the student loan interest rate, scheduled to rise later this year, at 3.4 percent. Alexander made the point that the Obama administration had also proposed using the health fund made possible by the student loan savings for other purposes, including deficit reduction. Also in his speech, he was critical of the move to get rid of the subsidies to the banks through direct student loans. He said those who proposed the direct loans "did that on the theory that the banks were making too much money." Again, the savings over 10 years is expected to be $58 billion – money that would have gone not to students, but to the banks’ bottom lines. As our colleagues in Ohio wrote: The combined student loan-health care bill did not reduce the amount of money that students can borrow. It actually expanded the amount of money available for student aid. What it reduced is the banks’ share. Alexander also made the case that the government is borrowing money at 2.8 percent and lending it to students at 6.8 percent in order to fund the health care program. That’s the explanation for his saying the government is "overcharging students." Alexander did not say whether there was "overcharging" when private banks were making student loans with the help of federal government subsidies. As for whether the federal government is "overcharging" students with the higher interest rate on money it lends, that’s a matter of public policy -- and in 2010, 56 senators agreed with it. Our colleagues in New Hampshire explained that just pointing out the spread on those two interest rates does not put the entire program’s costs into proper context. Now that they are not receiving subsidies, banks have largely gotten out of the student loan business because it is not profitable for them -- even though they can get the same terms as the federal government. "Banks can borrow at the same rate as the federal government," Jason Delisle, director of the Federal Education Budget Project at the New America Foundation, told them. "They don’t make money off lending to students at 6.8 percent. … This concept that the difference between the rate the government charges on the loan and the rate they pay to borrow is profit, is totally wrong." Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Pensions and Labor, which is chaired by Democrat Tom Harkin, said that subsidized loans do not make money for the government. They actually cost the federal government money. "The claim seems to conflate two completely unrelated issues," Sessions said. "The 6.8 percent interest rate was set by Congress in 2002 with overwhelming bipartisan support and it was the projected average rate that would result in 2006 under a fixed rate formula." Our ruling Do the savings from ending the private banking subsidies for student loans help pay for the health care law? Yes, but only 15 percent of those savings is going to health care, and even with that, the bill actually expanded the amount of revenue available for assisting students financially. We rule Alexander’s statement Half True.	None	Lamar Alexander	None	None	None	2012-06-10T06:00:00	2012-05-07	['None']

pomt-02770	"Defensive medicine costs Georgia up to $14 billion a year."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/11/doctors-healthy-georgia/estimates-vary-cost-defensive-medicine/	Some Georgians are finding more than the usual junk mail and bills in their mailboxes -- and we’re not talking about Christmas cards. There are glossy fliers discussing an effort to drastically change how patients can get compensated from medical malpractice, columnist Charlie Harper noted on his blog, Peach Pundit. Proponents want state lawmakers to pass a tort reform bill that would create an 11-member board to review alleged malpractice cases and award settlements. Too many doctors are charging for unnecessary medical tests, procedures or consultations in order to defend themselves in case they face lawsuits, say supporters of tort reform. Defensive medicine, it’s called. And what’s the impact to Georgians? "We know that an overwhelming number of Georgia physicians practice defensive medicine," Wayne Oliver, executive director of Patients for Fair Compensation, said on the organization’s website. "In Georgia alone, the practice of defensive medicine costs up to $14 billion annually." Oliver, a longtime Georgia lobbyist, helped start Doctors for a Healthy Georgia, which cites the same figure. He said approximately 900 physicians have expressed support for the tort reform legislation. PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d do some lab work to see if the estimate is correct. Oliver said his interest in the subject began when he worked with the Center for Health Transformation, a group created by former Georgia congressman and House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In his work with the center, Oliver said he noticed that some doctors were providing care aimed at avoiding litigation. He supports two tort reform bills that weren’t passed last year by the Georgia Legislature. Some believe there should be a cap on malpractice. President Barack Obama has said defensive medicine "may be contributing to unnecessary costs" but has been reluctant to support a cap on malpractice cases. Oliver has made his case for such legislation in Forbes, The Washington Times and other publications. Oliver’s team forwarded us a 2012 report that examined the economics of defensive medicine in Georgia. The report, by a German-based team of researchers done for Patients for Fair Compensation, looked at two studies on the economic impact of defensive medicine in this state. The annual figures ranged from $14 billion to $22 billion. A 2010 Gallup-Jackson Healthcare report is referenced by many tort reform advocates. The report surveyed 462 randomly selected physicians who attribute 26 percent of overall health care costs to the practice of defensive medicine. Another Jackson Healthcare online survey of about 3,000 physicians attributed 34 percent of total health care costs to defensive medicine. Jackson Healthcare leaders multiplied federal estimates of health care costs ($2.6 trillion) times the 26 percent estimate from the physicians surveyed to conclude that defensive medicine could cost this country at least $650 billion a year. Georgia represents about 3 percent of the nation’s population. If the Jackson Healthcare estimate is correct, Georgia’s share of annual defensive medicine costs is approximately $19.5 billion, which is halfway between the estimates in the report cited by Oliver. Emory University economics professor David Frisvold reviewed the study earlier this year at the request of Patients for Fair Compensation. Frisvold cautioned that surveys of physicians to determine defensive medicine costs "are likely towards the upper bound of the extent of defensive medicine as physicians may conflate physician-induced demand practices and defensive medicine practices." Still, the professor concluded Georgia could save several billion dollars in defensive medicine as well as Medicaid costs over a 10-year period through medical tort reform. The $650 billion nationwide estimate has been used by U.S. Rep. Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon from north Fulton County, and Georgia Aquarium benefactor Bernie Marcus. Other reports, though, offer an assortment of conclusions about the financial impact of defensive medicine. Some support Oliver’s argument. Some do not. University of Michigan professor emeritus J. William Thomas co-authored a report published in September 2010 that found the costs of defensive medicine are "minuscule" nationally. Thomas and his team researched a database of more than 400 million paid medical and pharmaceutical claims amassed from CIGNA Healthcare from July 2004 to June 2006. The report concluded that even with significant reductions in medical malpractice premiums, defensive medicine costs would decline by just 0.4 percent nationally. Thomas said defensive medicine cost estimates vary because most research on the topic focuses on a few conditions. "The politicians," he told us, "will pick and choose from the evidence they want to cite." Thomas referred us to another September 2010 report by Harvard University professor Michelle Mello and four other researchers. The report noted that defensive medicine costs are "notoriously difficult to obtain" because the definition varies. What some doctors see as a preventative medical procedure another believes is unnecessary. The team used a conservative estimate of 5.4 percent for the impact of defensive medicine, based upon a key prior study on the topic, and multiplied that by estimated annual totals for hospital spending of nearly $720 billion, which came up to $38.8 billion. The team then added some other costs it attributed to the impact of defensive medicine. Mello and her team estimated the national annual cost of defensive medicine was $45.5 billion, but cautioned in their report that the quality of evidence supporting that cost estimate is low because the hospital spending estimates are derived from a narrow range of diagnoses. The $45.5 billion national estimate is a fraction of the $650 billion estimate cited in the report by Oliver. "The estimates are all over the board," Oliver agreed. "What we do know is it’s a big number." To sum up, Doctors for a Healthy Georgia said defensive medicine costs Georgia up to $14 billion a year. The estimate is on target if you rely on some reports. Other reports would suggest the impact to Georgia is far less. Everyone agrees the economic impact estimates are wide-ranging. To score a True on this one, you would have to acknowledge that there are wide-ranging estimates of the costs of defensive medicine. This statement is at least partially accurate, but you would need a lot of context to fully understand its full implications. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-07742	"The American people have endured 21 consecutive months of 9% or higher unemployment [and] 2.6 million jobs have been lost," since the stimulus bill was signed.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/28/george-allen/george-allen-says-26-million-jobs-have-been-lost-s/	George Allen was in no mood celebrate the second anniversary of President Barack Obama signing into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on Feb. 17. The Republican observed the occasion by firing an e-mail to reporters blasting the stimulus bill and the president. "Two years ago today, President Obama signed into law a $800 billion jobless stimulus bill that promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent," said Allen, who is running to regain the U.S. Senate seat he lost to Democrat Jim Webb in 2006. "Instead the American people have endured 21 consecutive months of 9 percent or higher unemployment, 2.6 million jobs have been lost, and our nation’s debt has hit a record-setting $14 trillion." There are several things we wanted to check in this statement: Did the bill really "promise" that the unemployment rate would stay below 8 percent? Has unemployment really been above 9 percent for 21 months in a row, with 2.6 million jobs lost since the stimulus was signed? This report will take on the second of those questions, looking at the unemployment rate and the number of jobs lost in the last two years. In a story tomorrow, we will examine Allen’s claim that the stimulus "promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent." Katie Wright, director of communications for Allen’s Senate campaign, said the unemployment and job-loss data came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The national unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in April 2008 but began racing higher as the American and global economies fell into recession. The rate crossed the 9 percent threshold in May 2009 and has stayed above that level every month since. It peaked at 10.1 percent in October 2009. In January the unemployment rate fell to 9 percent, down from 9.4 percent in December 2010. So the BLS data backs Allen up. The unemployment rate has been at 9 percent or higher for exactly 21 months. What about the number of jobs lost? We looked at BLS job data from March 2009, the first full month after the stimulus bill was signed, through this January. The economy shed 3.5 million jobs during the last 10 months of 2009. It gained 909,000 during 2010 and another 36,000 in January of this year. That leaves us with a net loss of 2.57 million. With rounding, that comes out at 2.6 million. So Allen’s right again. What Allen ignores in his statement is that many jobs were saved by stimulus funds in school districts and local governments that used federal money to pay employees rather than making layoffs. There also were construction jobs created through projects funded by the stimulus. Uncle Sam has been tracking stimulus spending at www.recovery.gov, and the program is overseen by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board. Each quarter, recipients of the federal aid have reported the number of jobs being funded with stimulus money during the past three months. During the final quarter of 2010, 585,654 jobs were reportedly being funded through stimulus dollars. The third quarter of 2010 saw 675,841 stimulus-supported jobs, the second quarter 750,045 jobs and the first quarter of last year 682,322 jobs. During 2009 the program was supporting between 600,000 and 635,000 jobs, according to the Recovery Board. Edward Pound, the board’s director of communications, said the oversight agency has not tracked a total number of jobs created over the life of the program. He said the quarterly estimates were considered the most accurate measurement since stimulus funding often goes towards road and construction projects, which may only provide jobs for a finite period of time. Let’s review. Allen said "the American people have endured 21 consecutive months of 9 percent or higher unemployment," and that "2.6 million jobs have been lost" since the stimulus bill was signed in February 2009. The unemployment moved above 9 percent in May 2009 and has been at that level or higher for 21 months. Since March 2009, 2.57 million jobs have been lost, which rounds up to the 2.6 million figure cited by Allen. Allen ignores the number of jobs saved or created by stimulus, but the figures he uses in his claim are correct. We rate his statement True.

pomt-08895	"Warren Buffett called (Jeff) Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' "	false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/30/kendrick-meek/warren-buffett-was-talking-about-derivatives-gener/	Congressman Kendrick Meek launched his first TV attack ad against opponent Jeff Greene in the Florida Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate. The ad, called "He's the Man," attacks Greene's background as a billionaire who made money as the economy soured. "Meet the real Jeff Greene: Ran for Congress as a California Republican. Moved to Florida two years ago. Became a billionaire on Wall Street betting middle-class families would lose their homes. Helped fuel the economic meltdown. Warren Buffett called Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' " The ad then shows footage of Greene saying, "They'll attack me for my friends and my past when I was single. Some of it's true, but none of it matters." "Betting on suffering does matter," the narrator responds. We fact-checked the statement about Greene running for Congress as a Republican in a separate report, and labeled it True. And last month, we fact-checked a claim from Meek that Greene was responsible for hurting the economy. We looked at Meek's statement that Greene "is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now." We rated that Barely True. Our reporting then showed that Greene did make big money on credit default swaps, a type of derivative that paid off when mortgage-backed securities failed. But we also found that Meek was pumping up Greene's role in a complicated economic situation where many different financial players did things that ended up hurting the economy. (Read our full report.) Here, we wanted to check the claim about Warren Buffett, that he "called Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.' " Buffett runs Berkshire Hathaway, a holding company renowned for its savvy investment strategies, and he's No. 2 on the 2009 Forbes list of wealthiest Americans. Some folks call Buffett "the Oracle of Omaha." We were suspicious that Greene (who's only No. 317 on the Forbes list) would have made it onto Buffett's radar. We should note here that journalists love Buffett's phrase "financial weapons of mass destruction." We found it repeated again and again in stories about the role derivatives played in the financial collapse of 2008. It turns out Buffett coined the phrase to describe derivatives back in 2003, when he published his annual letter to investors discussing his thoughts on the previous year's business. Buffett warned that it was difficult to truly evaluate the risks involved in derivatives. "Essentially, these instruments call for money to change hands at some future date, with the amount to be determined by one or more reference items, such as interest rates, stock prices or currency values," Buffett wrote. "The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen)," he continued. "At Enron, for example, newsprint and broadband derivatives, due to be settled many years in the future, were put on the books. Or say you want to write a contract speculating on the number of twins to be born in Nebraska in 2020. No problem -- at a price, you will easily find an obliging counterparty." Buffett warned that derivatives could become unforeseen catastrophes for some companies. "Imagine, then, that a company is downgraded because of general adversity and that its derivatives instantly kick in with their requirement, imposing an unexpected and enormous demand for cash collateral on the company. The need to meet this demand can then throw the company into a liquidity crisis that may, in some cases, trigger still more downgrades. It all becomes a spiral that can lead to a corporate meltdown," he wrote. It turns out this is exactly what happened at some of the biggest financial firms in the country in 2008 -- five years after Buffett's warning. Buffett was discussing derivatives in the context of Berkshire Hathaway's investment in a company called General Re Securities. Buffett said he attempted to sell without success. At the time he wrote the letter, he was trying to shut down the business, but was having problems resolving the many derivatives contracts General Re had on its books. "We try to be alert to any sort of megacatastrophe risk, and that posture may make us unduly apprehensive about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivatives contracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside," Buffet wrote. "In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal." Buffett doesn't mention Greene at all in his 2003 letter. And in fact, our previous reporting on Greene's financial activities indicate he did most of his trading in 2006 and later, three years after Buffett's letter. Still, there's no doubt Greene was heavily involved in buying credit default swaps, which are a type of derivative. And Buffett was exceptionally critical of derivatives. The problem with Meek's ad is that it gives the impression that Buffett criticized Greene personally, which he didn't do. By saying Buffett called Greene's scheme a bad idea, Meek personalizes a comment that had nothing to do with Greene. Because of that, we rate Meek's statement False.

pomt-06683	"Republicans fought to protect tax loopholes for corporations that send our jobs overseas."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/07/service-employees-international-union-committee-po/republicans-closing-corporate-tax-loopholes/	Republicans support tax breaks for corporations that send jobs overseas, says a political mailer from Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, a union that represents service workers. "Republicans in Congress aren't getting the message," the mailer says. "Unemployment is hurting everyone in our economy, and we need to bring jobs back to America. But rather than fighting to create jobs for the middle class, Republicans in Congress fought to protect unfair tax breaks for big special interest groups and companies that ship American jobs overseas." "Tell Republicans in Congress: It's time to bring back jobs to America," the mailer concludes. We wondered what SEIU's claim was based on. Obviously, there's no official tax break for shipping job overseas. Still, the claim is becoming a common one among Democrats. So we thought it would be useful to review some of the more specific claims we've already fact-checked here, before making a ruling on SEIU's broad claim. Deductions for business costs. Some Democrats are steamed that businesses closing U.S. operations can deduct the closing costs as standard business expenses. "The law, right now, permits companies that close down American factories and offices and move those jobs overseas to take a tax deduction for the costs associated with moving the jobs to China or India or wherever," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., last year. PolitiFact Rhode Island delved into Whitehouse's statement in some detail and ruled his statement True. In general, businesses can deduct any costs they face in the course of doing business. And the costs of shuttering a factory in the United States are not exempt. Whitehouse supported legislation to change that by disallowing exemptions associated with offshoring, which an official summary defines as "any transaction in which a taxpayer reduces or eliminates the operation of a trade or business in connection with the start-up or expansion of such trade or business outside the United States." The bill failed in the Senate because it couldn't get the 60 votes required to cut off the threat of filibuster and move the bill toward final passage. The bill failed on a 53-45 vote, largely along party lines, with Democrats voting for it and Republicans voting against it. Rule changes for foreign profits. President Barack Obama has charged Republicans with fighting for tax breaks for companies that outsource jobs. In 2010, Obama signed a bill into law that provided economic aid to states. So that the bill didn't add to the deficit, it also changed rules on foreign profits for companies. In a speech last year, Obama said called the old rules "loopholes" that "actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas." "Even a lot of America's biggest corporations agreed that this loophole didn't make sense, agreed that it needed to be closed, agreed that it wasn't fair," Obama said in a speech. Obama said that John Boehner, then the Republican leader and now the Speaker of the House, "wants to reopen this loophole." It's a bit complicated to explain these tax loopholes, so bear with us. Basically, the United States government taxes companies on foreign profits, which not all countries do. But companies don't have to pay taxes on foreign profits until they bring the profits back to this country. So companies tend to keep the money with their foreign subsidiaries as long as possible. But companies also get U.S. tax credits for taxes they pay to foreign governments. Some companies figured out how to game the system by keeping their profits overseas while still claiming a tax credit for taxes paid to foreign governments. The new rules say companies can't claim the foreign tax credit until bring the profits back to the United States. The tax experts we interviewed said the old situation was definitely a loophole. But they didn't see it as a loophole particularly connected to outsourcing. And while Boehner did oppose the new rules, his position was that any increased tax burden on American companies would make them less competitive against their foreign rivals. We rated Obama's statement Half True. He's was right that Boehner opposed changing the rules, but there wasn't a direct connection to outsourced jobs. Overall Republican opposition to tax increases. Finally, some Democrats have seized on the fact that most Republicans oppose any and all tax increases, period. That means they're in favor of any current tax loopholes for offshoring corporations, according to this line of reasoning. That was the basis for a political attack in last fall's congressional race in Virginia's 5th District. Democrat Tom Periello, the incumbent, said Republican challenger Robert Hurt "supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas." The basis for his claim was that Hurt had signed the "Taxpayer Protection Pledge," a famous no-taxes pledge from Grover Norquist and his group Americans for Tax Reform. We rated Periello's statement False. The pledge says that tax changes are okay as long as they result in no net tax increases. And it doesn't mention offshoring of jobs. Hurt won the election. The SEIU's position The SEIU referred us to the rules changes for foreign profits to back up its claim, the same charge that Obama made last year. Multinational companies are sending jobs overseas, and Republicans opposed tightening the tax rules on those multinationals, said Jennifer Farmer, SEIU's deputy communications director. "We continue to stand by our earlier comments: In the midst of tough economic times, when lawmakers should be working together to create quality jobs and find a way out of our country’s deepening recession, Republicans in Congress have focused on the wrong priorities. They have focused on protecting big oil and tax breaks for the rich. This was true when we included the message on our mail piece. It remains true today," Farmer said. We went back and reviewed the vote on tightening tax rules on foreign profits. At the time, Democrats controlled the Congress, and the measure passed with the support of two moderate Republican senators, Sen. Olympia Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins, both of Maine. We should also reiterate that the experts we spoke with warned us that there's no direct connection between outsourcing and taxes on foreign profits. In 2010, shortly after the law passed, Lawrence Lokken of the University of Florida warned us that experts disagree about the effects of international tax rules on job creation. "Whether the current system encourages companies to move jobs offshore, and whether these fixes will discourage companies from doing so, are hotly debated issues. You can find entirely respectable opinion on each side of the issues," he said. Our ruling The SEIU is correct that Republicans did fight against Democratic plans to close tax loopholes on multinational corporations. But whether the corporations who took advantage of the tax loopholes were also outsourcing jobs is an unanswered question. The link between the multinationals' tax status and their outsourcing of jobs is not direct, and that's an important distinction. We rate the mailer's claim Half True.

The legislature has spent less than 1 percent of that on roads."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/feb/18/grover-norquist/norquist-says-virginia-has-spent-less-1-percent-bu/	Grover Norquist, one of the most influential voices in the United States against raising taxes, is opposed to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s transportation plan. McDonnell’s proposal to generate $3.2 billion over five years relies, in part, on ending the state’s fixed 17.5-cent per gallon gas tax and increasing the 5 percent sales tax to 5.8 percent. The plan also would raise the annual $41 registration fee for most vehicles to $56. Norquist, who is president of the Americans for Tax Reform, says those two parts of McDonnell’s plan qualify as tax increases. He has warned the 30 Republican state legislators who have signed his organization’s pledge to oppose tax increases that support of McDonnell’s plan would break their promise. Norquist says Virginia should find a way to fix its roads without raising taxes. One way to do that, he said during a Feb. 7 radio interview, would be to earmark the state’s budget surpluses for transportation. "There’s been over $1 billion in surplus over the last three years, the legislature has spent less than 1 percent of that on roads," Norquist said on the John Fredericks Show. "So if you can’t prioritize unexpected revenue because the economy grew faster than you were planning, when can you begin to prioritize roads?" We wondered whether Virginia really has spent less than 1 percent of its surplus on roads during the last three years. We contacted Paul Blair, a spokesman for Americans for Tax Reform. He said Norquist’s statement was based on press clippings and budget presentations the McDonnell administration made to the General Assembly during fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012. The total surplus for three those years came to $1.4 billion. Blair also cited administration figures for the amount of the surplus each year that went to transportation: $32.7 million in 2010; $67.2 million in 2011 surplus and $0 in 2012 surplus. That comes to a total of $99.9 million in surpluses that went to the state’s Transportation Trust Fund. Blair acknowledged those figures mean that the amount that went to transportation is not less than 1 percent, as Norquist said. Less than 1 percent would mean less than $14 million of surplus went to transportation over the last three years. "Initial information provided by members of the state legislature was incorrect. The actual amount spent on transportation projects is $99.9 million, roughly 7 percent of surplus funds," Blair wrote in an e-mail. "The facts remain: when presented with the opportunity to designate more money to the Transportation Trust Fund from annual surpluses, the legislature generally designates the money to any and everything else." Blair declined to identify the legislators who he said provided the wrong information. He said 7 percent is still a low number, adding that a 2007 state law calls for ensuring that 67 percent of "undesignated" surpluses are required to go to transportation. "To circumvent state law on the amount of money required to go to transportation from a surplus, the legislature ensures that the 67 percent of ‘remaining funds’ is very little," Blair said. "In 2012, it was a whopping $0." We spoke with Neil Miller, Virginia’s deputy finance secretary, who confirmed $99.9 million has gone to the Transportation Trust Fund from the 2010 and 2011 surpluses and no money at all went there from the 2012 surplus. About two-thirds of the sum -- $61.7 million -- was earmarked for the Virginia Transportation Infrastructure Bank, a state program that lends money to localities and private entities to help pay for road, rail, and other transportation projects. About half of the three-year $1.4 billion surplus that McDonnell announced in August comes from revenues that exceeded estimates. Most of the rest comes from allocated money that was not spent. Miller explained in an e-mail that various state laws mandate where much of the state surplus money has to go. For example the state’s constitution requires that a portion of the surplus be deposited in the rainy day fund, used to cushion Virginia through lean budget cycles. The fund was drawn down during the Great Recession and received a combined $211 million from the 2011 and 2012 surpluses. Virginia law also requires a portion goes to the state’s water quality improvement fund, which got $103.7 million of surplus money over the last three fiscal years. Another $47.7 million went into a reserve fund for disaster relief. The General Assembly often adds to the list by approving budgets that allocate in advance portions of surpluses that might occur for other priorities, such as a bonus paid to state employees last December. There have been proposals over the years to boost the portion of surpluses that are funneled to transportation. In 2007, Republican’s unsuccessfully sought to reserve half of all future budget surpluses for road maintenance. Democrats have opposed the efforts. One reason is that the surplus comes from the state’s general fund, which draws largely from income and sales taxes to pay for education, public safety and health programs. Transportation is primarily funded by a different set of revenues: federal grants and state taxes on gasoline, vehicle sales and licenses. Many Democrats have insisted that surpluses should be returned to general fund programs. Democrats and some senate Republicans also have noted that the state does not always end its fiscal year in surplus, and argued that Virginia needs a long-term, dependable source of new revenues to solve its transportation problems. A final note: The major parts of McDonnell’s transportation plan have been approved by the House. The Senate has passed a more ambitious plan that would generate $900 million a year by increasing the gas tax and pegging it to inflation, raising vehicle registration fees and empowering localities to impose a local sales tax for transportation projects. House and Senate negotiators are trying to reach a compromise before the General Assembly’s scheduled adjournment on Feb. 23. Our ruling Norquist said the state legislature spent less than 1 percent of its surplus over the last three years on roads. His organization acknowledges that number is wrong. The correct figure is 7 percent, a difference equaling at least $86 million. We rate Norquist’s statement False.	None	Grover Norquist	None	None	None	2013-02-18T06:00:00	2013-02-07	['Virginia']

pomt-06719	A national study of 2,500 charter schools shows that "maybe 20 percent do better than the community public schools, 40 percent or so do worse and the rest are not having any significant difference."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/sep/01/james-parisi/ri-union-leaders-says-national-study-shows-20-perc/	During a recent discussion on Channel 10’s "News Conference" about efforts to expand charter schools in Rhode Island, James Parisi, field representative and lobbyist for the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and Health Professionals, challenged the notion that charter schools improve student performance. "I think one of the studies that I pay most attention to," Parisi said, "indicated, on a nationwide basis, looking at two and a half thousand charter schools around the country, maybe 20 percent do better than the community public schools, 40 percent or so do worse and the rest are not having any significant difference." Rhode Island has 16 charter schools, including a new one opening Sept. 7, and more are expected to open soon. The state has a three-year, $9.4-million federal grant to expand existing charter schools, open additional ones and build partnerships between charter and traditional public schools. State Education Commissioner Deborah Gist invited Achievement First, a charter school management operator, to come to Rhode Island. And Gist has testified in favor of a proposal by Cranston Mayor Allan W. Fung -- to be voted on Thursday by the state Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education -- to open a "mayoral academy" charter school. Fung hopes to eventually create a network of five such charter schools in Cranston and Providence. Though taxpayer financed, charter schools generally are run by their own boards and and have more control over how they spend their money on. Rhode Island charter schools are required to participate in standardized testing, but they’re free from some of the administrative staffing rules and contractual restrictions that determine policies such as the length of the school year and school dress codes. Most charter schools admit students by lottery. Supporters of charter schools often hail them as a solution to the failures, real or perceived, of the nation’s public schools. Skeptics, Parisi among them, say they tend to siphon students and resources from traditional public schools. And he referenced a study that, he said, cast doubt about the educational value of charter schools. So we decided to check that out. We contacted Parisi, who faxed us page 142 from "Death and Life of the Great American School System: How Testing and Choice Are Undermining Education," a book by prominent education writer and charter school critic Diane Ravitch. Ravitch referenced a 2009 study by researchers at Stanford University that analyzed data from 2,403 charter schools in 15 states and the District of Columbia, or roughly 65 to 70 percent of the nation’s charter schools at the time. Ravitch’s summary of the study results was roughly what Parisi had said, but we didn’t want to take the author’s word for it. So we went online and found the study. Entitled "Multiple Choice: Charter School Performance in 16 States," (or 15 states and the District of Columbia), the so-called CREDO study was released June 2009 by Stanford University’s Center for Research on Education and Outcomes. (Rhode Island was not among the study’s participants.) The authors summarized their findings this way: "The study reveals that a decent fraction of charter schools, 17 percent, provide superior education opportunities for their students. Nearly half of the charter schools nationwide (46 percent) have results that are no different from the local public school options and over a third, 37 percent, deliver learning results that are significantly worse than their student would have realized had they remained in traditional public schools.’’ The percentages correlated roughly with the ones Parisi described. He said 20 percent do better; the study reported it was 17 percent; he said 40 percent do worse, the study reported 37 percent; and he said the rest (46 percent the study said) showed no significant difference. We wondered, though, if this particular study is one we could trust. So we called some experts. "It’s still among the best,’’ Gary Miron, a professor of education at Western Michigan University’s Department of Educational Leadership, said. Miron reviewed Stanford University’s CREDO study for The Think Tank Review Project, which was created in 2006 by two academic centers associated with the Education Policy Research Unit at Arizona State University and the University of Colorado at Boulder to provide academically sound reviews of think-tank publications. The project is financed by the Great Lakes Center for Education Research Practice. "The relative strength and comprehensiveness of the data set used for this study, as well as the solid analytic approaches of the researchers,’’ the reviewers wrote, "makes this report a useful contribution to the charter school research base." Though a better study, Miron said, financed by the U.S. Department of Education was released last June. But Stanford University’s CREDO study remains the largest-scale study he’s seen measuring charter school performance. The Department of Education study, conducted by Mathematica Policy Research, also concluded that charter middle schools that choose their students by lotteries are no more or less successful than traditional middle schools in improving student achievement in reading and math. But the latest Mathematica study found that the impact of charter schools is not necessarily the same for all children across the board. In fact, that study found that charter schools were more effective for lower income and lower achieving students, and less effective for higher income and higher achieving students. Charter schools in large urban areas, the Mathematica study showed, had positive impacts on students’ achievement in math -- as opposed to negative impacts for children who lived outside these large urban areas. The results of Stanford University’s CREDO study, which Parisi used in his argument, also were more nuanced than he’d suggested. In the report’s "executive summary," the authors write that "charter schools have different impacts on students based on their family backgrounds." Students who are black or Hispanic in charter schools performed "significantly worse" educationally than their peers in traditional public schools, the study found. But students from poor families who had limited English skills and attended charter schools showed "better academic growth" than their traditional public school peers. The outcomes for students in special education programs, the study found, were about the same. In the end, Parisi quoted a national study of charter schools that is widely recognized as reputable. While he omitted some of the studies more nuanced findings -- so important to any debate about charter schools -- he quoted its main conclusions accurately. We rate his statement True.

pomt-04520	"The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/03/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-state-income-tax-jumped-2-perc/	Whet the appetite of liberal politicians with a new tax and Gov. Chris Christie warns they’ll become ravenous. That’s why Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire they should vote on Nov. 6 for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. Otherwise New Hampshire, which doesn’t tax wages, may go the way of New Jersey. Christie said 35 years ago New Jersey also didn’t have an income tax, but then "Governor Brendan Byrne, a Democrat, said if you just give me a small income tax, just a little one, I will lower your property taxes, for the people who have the highest property taxes in America back in 1977. So 35 years later, what have we got? We still have the highest property taxes in America and the income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent -- 9 percent. "Here's the key everybody: you let a liberal politician in the door and give them permission to give you a new tax, they only know one direction for that tax to go and that's up," Christie said at the Sept. 25 event. Did New Jersey’s income tax more than quadruple since it was first enacted, as Christie said? The governor’s statement is partially accurate because a group of individuals -- those earning more than $500,000 in taxable income -- are now subject to a statutory income tax rate of 8.97 percent. But those individuals represent only a small percentage of filers in New Jersey and the tax rates are lower for other income levels. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but the history of the state’s income tax is clear. In 1976 -- during Byrne’s first term -- the state passed a temporary income tax with two rates. A 2 percent rate was levied on income less than $20,000 or about $80,000 in today’s dollars, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Income in excess of $20,000 was taxed at the top rate of 2.5 percent. A year after the temporary tax was enacted, the state made it permanent. Over time New Jersey modeled its income tax into a more progressive system, which now has rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent depending on income level and filing status. The state’s top rate is 8.97 percent, which only applies to income in excess of $500,000. Less than 2 percent of taxable New Jersey resident returns in 2009 had that level of income, according to state Treasury Department data. An individual with taxable income between $75,000 and $500,000 pays a 6.37 percent rate on that income. For income between $40,000 and $75,000, the rate is about 5.5 percent. The lowest rates are 1.4 percent and 1.75 percent, which are lower than the state’s rates in 1976. Those rates apply to incomes below $20,000 or between $20,000 and $35,000, respectively. So for Christie to suggest the income tax, in general, jumped from 2 percent to 9 percent is misleading. That’s true for one income level, but the statement oversimplifies New Jersey’s current income tax system. Our ruling Christie said, "The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent." When the state first implemented an income tax in 1976, two rates existed -- 2 percent for income less than $20,000 and 2.5 percent for income more than $20,000 -- but the state has since introduced a more progressive tax system. New Jersey’s top rate is nearly 9 percent now, but applies only to taxable income above $500,000. Every other income bracket is subject to a rate lower than 9 percent, with some income levels charged a rate of less than 2 percent. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-13631	Says Hillary Clinton tripled the number of people with AIDS whose "lives are being saved .. and it did not cost you any more money."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/aug/10/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-hillary-tripled-aids-treatment-withou/	When Bill Clinton wasn’t retelling how he courted his wife, he filled his Democratic convention speech, later published on Medium, with a long list of Hillary Clinton’s achievements in public life. When he got to her time as secretary of state, he applauded her work on HIV/AIDS. "She tripled the number of people with AIDS in four countries whose lives are being saved with your tax dollars," Clinton said. "Most of them in Africa, going from 1.7 million lives to 5.1 million lives, and it did not cost you any more money. She just bought available FDA-approved generic drugs." We decided to take a closer look at those treatment gains and the price tag that came with them. Clinton’s statement is a bit unclear, first referencing a tripling in four countries, then giving the top-line treatment numbers that span many nations. We reached out to Clinton’s office for clarification. His staff told us that Clinton was talking about the overall HIV/AIDS treatment activities of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. We took his essential claim to be that thanks to his wife, treatment tripled and costs held steady. That’s not perfectly accurate, but it's close. PEPFAR started under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama kept it going. Hillary Clinton can take some credit for PEPFAR’s achievements because it is a State Department program. One of PEPFAR’s major goals is to get as many people as possible into treatment, primarily in Africa but on other continents, too. There is no cure for AIDS, still, antiretroviral drugs can slow down the HIV virus in the body, sometimes for many years. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, looked at how efficiently PEPFAR was getting those antiretrovirals to people in need. That report backed up Clinton’s statement, but it only covered the years between 2005 and 2011. Here’s why that’s important. Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009 through January 2013. For a full view of what PEPFAR did on her watch, we got the numbers through 2012. Drawing on the GAO report, PEPFAR’s own reports, and numbers we got from PEPFAR staff, we found these trends: The charts tell us that the number of people in treatment rose from 2.1 million at the end of 2008 to 5.1 million by the end of 2012 (fiscal years). That number more than doubled, but it didn’t quite triple as Clinton said. However, that increase did come without additional tax dollars. Using constant 2009 dollars, treatment spending fell dramatically for two years, and then returned to the 2009 level. When you put the two trends together, the big picture is that the United States used the same amount of money to deliver about 250 percent more treatment. Eric Goosby, the head of PEPFAR during those years and now professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, said the George W. Bush administration laid the groundwork for those gains. "It takes a lot time to find the places to set up treatment, and get all the pieces in place to deliver it," Goosby told us. "We benefited from all of that." But Goosby also points to the rapid shift to generic drugs after 2009. "We went from buying 90 percent brand name antiretroviral drugs to less than 3 percent," Goosby said. The generic drugs were much cheaper. The program also cut costs by cutting out air delivery and moving goods by land and sea. "This saved millions of dollars and allowed for an uninterrupted expansion of the number of patients on treatment," he said. The chart above shows that on Hillary Clinton’s watch, the costs per patient were driven down by more than half — from $673 when she took control to $338 when she left. The question is, does she deserve the credit? Mead Over, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington policy center, urges a bit of caution. Over told us that while a lot of the work is done by State Department agencies, not all of it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health and other agencies also play a role. But at the end of the day, Over told us the secretary of state sets the priorities and in this case, the priority was to expand treatment at a lower cost per person. There's evidence that Clinton wasn't just phoning it in. AIDS activists counted her as an ally. Mark Harrington, executive director of the Treatment Action Group, a New York-based advocacy organization, said he would give Clinton a lot of credit for what happened. Harrington said she built stronger reporting ties with PEPFAR than her predecesor and had a clear picture of what was needed. Harrington gave one example of how that led to her direct involvement. "She helped clear the way for the switch from using expensive international NGOs to deliver services, to working with in-country partners and ministries of health," Harrington said. "There was a concern about corruption, and she made it very clear to foreign leaders that that could not happen. And it’s really surprising for a program this big that it hasn’t." Harrington also noted that Clinton was engaged with HIV/AIDS before she became secretary. When she was in the Senate, she met with activists and advocated for the programs and funds they sought. Our ruling Bill Clinton said when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, she tripled the number of people with AIDS whose "lives are being saved," and it didn’t cost taxpayers any more money. Clinton took some liberties with the numbers. Treatment rose rapidly by about 250 percent. That’s not quite triple. But Clinton was right that those gains came without additional spending in inflation-adjusted dollars. And while Hillary Clinton can’t take full credit, outsiders said she did set the overall direction for how the program should move forward and intervened in specific ways to help it do more at a lower cost.

pomt-08837	"I’ve even cut my own salary -- twice."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/11/kevin-boyce/ohio-treasurer-kevin-boyce-twice-cut-his-own-pay/	Elected officials’ pay can be a sensitive topic with taxpayers, especially in today’s economic climate. So it’s no surprise Ohio Treasurer Kevin Boyce, who is running in November to keep his job, is bragging about cutting his salary. Boyce talked about his six-figure earnings in a YouTube video released by his office. Presented as a preview of the office’s forthcoming annual financial report, the production feels more like a tribute to Boyce’s performance as treasurer aimed directly at voters. "I’ve even cut my salary -- twice," said Boyce, a Democrat and former Columbus city councilman. Boyce was appointed Treasurer in late 2008. Richard Cordray left a vacancy when he took the state attorney general’s job in the wake of Marc Dann’s resignation. Annual salaries for the state’s elected officials are set in state law, which lawmakers can amend to increase or decrease pay. The treasurer’s salary has been set at $109,986 since 2008. In June 2009, Boyce sent a memo to the state Department of Administrative Services saying he was taking a pay cut that would reduce his gross salary that year to $107,874. The pay cut, effective July 1, 2009, was the equivalent of taking five unpaid furlough days, a cost-saving measure that has been forced upon many state employees. In the same memo, Boyce authorized an extension of the reduction for all of 2010. This year’s pay cut is the equivalent of 10 unpaid furlough days, according to the administrative services department. Boyce’s gross salary this year will be $105,757. Boyce lumped both cuts -- each about 2 percent -- in the same memo, but he effectively trimmed his salary twice. Had he not extended the cut into 2010, his pay would’ve jumped back up to $109,986, a spokeswoman for the administrative services department said. We find Boyce’s statement True.

pomt-10542	"We send a billion dollars to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/22/barack-obama/yes-a-costly-addiction-/	Senator Barack Obama may be well known for his verbal acumen, but it also turns out the Illinois Democrat is pretty good at math. At a debate in Austin Thursday night, the Democratic frontrunner reiterated a statement he has used numerous times on the campaign trail: "We send a billion dollars to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil." To get that figure requires some simple multiplication: barrels of oil imports per day times the cost of barrel of oil equals how much U.S. spends daily purchasing oil abroad. So we dusted off our multiplication tables and checked Obama's math. According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. imported 10,102,000 barrels per day of oil during the week ending Feb. 15. The average world price for a barrel of oil that same week was $89.91. That means energy firms spent $908 million on foreign oil daily in mid-February. Obama's campaign said they used $100 for the price of a barrel of oil, a record reached Feb. 19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That number has since dropped a bit – to $98.86 as of Friday afternoon. Redoing the math, what we spend abroad comes awfully close to the billion-dollar figure Obama quotes. It's 998.2 million. We'll allow him to round up. Obama gets a gold star in math, and we find his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-02-22T00:00:00	2008-02-21	['None']
pomt-05726	Wisconsin is called the Badger State because "our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/05/scott-walker/wisconsin-badger-state-because-early-miners-gov-sc/	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker wants to make it easier for a proposed iron ore mine, said to be worth more than $1 billion and packing potentially thousands of jobs, to win state approval. The Republican governor, who made creating 250,000 private-sector jobs his signature campaign promise, mostly touts expected economic benefits. But, pointing to symbols on the state flag, he also argues that mining is central to Wisconsin’s history. In a Feb. 23, 2012 interview on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee, Walker expressed hope that the Legislature would pass a bill to "streamline" the mine approval process. Then he made a claim about the state animal that might surprise some of us in Wisconsin who weren’t paying attention in school. "If there's any state in America that should be able to" adopt a mining bill that balances job creation and environmental safety, "it should be the Badger State," Walker said. "Because we're called the Badgers not because the animals are abundant here, but because we got nicknamed the Badgers because, back before we were a state, our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining. We should be able to do it again here in Wisconsin in 2012 and beyond." To be sure, the main issues involving the proposed mine are money and the environment. We found to be Mostly True a claim that the mine proposed for near Hurley in far northern Wisconsin could generate billions of dollars of economic activity over 100 years. Meanwhile, one Wisconsin conservation organization has said a mining bill pending in the Legislature would allow groundwater to be polluted and "our most sensitive wetlands to be filled in with mining waste." But given the governor’s new tack on promoting mining, we wondered whether Wisconsin, known more for brewing, milking and sausage making, got its Badgers nickname because of mining. Wisconsin mining origins Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie pointed us to a Wisconsin Historical Society article that explains the importance of mining in the state’s history. It said in part: "In the early nineteenth century, Wisconsin lead mining was more promising and attractive to potential settlers than either the fur trade or farming. Its potentially quick rewards lured a steady stream of settlers up the Mississippi River and into Grant, Crawford, Iowa, and Lafayette counties in the early nineteenth century. By 1829, more than 4,000 miners worked in southwestern Wisconsin, producing 13 million pounds of lead a year." As for mining’s connection to the badger, Werwie cited the state symbols section of the 2011-2012 Wisconsin Blue Book. It says that images on the state flag include a "yeoman (usually considered a miner) with a pick," a mining pick and shovel, and 13 lead ingots that represent "mineral wealth," as well as a badger. The Blue Book continues: "History, rather than the law, explains Wisconsin’s unofficial nickname as the ‘Badger State.’ During the lead-mining boom that began just prior to 1830 in southwestern Wisconsin, the name was first applied to miners who were too busy digging the ‘gray gold’ to build houses. Like badgers, they moved into abandoned mine shafts and makeshift burrows for shelter. Although ‘badgers’ had a somewhat derogatory connotation at first, it gradually gained acceptance as an apt description of the hardworking and energetic settlers of the Wisconsin Territory." The state historical society and the Blue Book are as solid as lead as sources on state history. We also found similar accounts about the connection between mining and the badger nickname in the historical society’s "Dictionary of Wisconsin History" and in a 1918 Milwaukee Sentinel article. Few miners ‘badgers’? But an article from the winter 1992-1993 edition of the historical society’s Wisconsin Magazine of History raised questions. Then-Marquette University history professor Karel Bicha wrote that proving the conventional wisdom about mining and the badger nickname "leads the investigator along an evidentiary pipeline which is ludicrously tenuous." That’s because the traditional understanding, he said, "derives largely from ‘tradition’ rather than verifiable ‘history.’" "Tradition aside," Bicha continued, "it is legitimate to wonder whether there were ever, in reality, any cave- or dugout-dwelling miners. If so, who first observed them in their natural or man-made hillside orifices and divined the inelegant nickname ‘badgers’ to refer to them?" He goes on to say there is plenty of evidence of large numbers of miners living in cabins and other dwellings, but little evidence that more than a small number lived as "badgers," or that they stayed in their caves or dugouts for very long. Nevertheless, Bicha concludes: "Realistically, the importance of the sobriquet ‘badgers’ lies not in its origin but in its diffusion. The diffusion of the term undoubtedly occurred by the same rapid and undocumentable process of oral transmission characteristic of slang, argot and jokes. "Within two decades of its creation the expression had become divested of its specific association with both miners and the lead region. By the mid-1840s it made no difference whether the badger tradition was rooted in past reality or possessed no more inherent substance than the legend of William Tell. It was synonymous with Wisconsin and its people -- all of its people." University of Wisconsin-Madison folklore professor James Leary, director of the Center for the Study of Upper Midwestern Cultures, notes -- somewhat disturbingly -- that badgers had quite a different definition in the British volume known as the 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue. Badgers were "a crew of desperate villains who robbed near rivers, into which they threw the bodies of those they murdered." Yikes. But Leary reassured us that the origin of the badgers nickname in Wisconsin is from mining. "There’s no doubt about that," he said. Our rating Walker said Wisconsin is called the Badger State because "our ancestors came here with the hopes of living the American dream by mining." At least one scholar suggests that the number of miners who lived like badgers was relatively small. But he and other authorities agree that the dwelling habits of at least some of the miners are what gave Wisconsin its nickname. We rate Walker’s statement True.

pomt-04637	"In Cuyahoga County ... 56 percent of weekend voters in 2008 were African American while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/14/marcia-fudge/marcia-fudge-says-black-voters-accounted-56-percen/	After some Ohio voters - including many in Cuyahoga County - faced hours-long voting lines during the 2004 presidential election, the state adopted reforms intended to prevent future backups, such as allowing extended time before elections for voters to cast in-person ballots at county elections boards. President Barack Obama’s 2008 voter mobilization effort made particular use of voting the Sunday before elections, as African-American churches organized "Souls to the Polls" events which brought worshippers to vote after religious services. Since then, Ohio’s Republican-controlled state legislature and GOP Secretary of State Jon Husted have cited budgetary concerns in making several efforts to reduce in-person early voting hours, engendering an uproar that included a federal lawsuit. On August 31, a federal judge ordered restoration of in-person early voting for the three days before election day, but Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine filed an appeal. Rep. Marcia Fudge and other Democrats have maintained Republicans want to eliminate that weekend’s early voting to cut turnout among African-Americans -- a claim Republicans deny. But in a recent news release from Fudge and Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, Fudge spoke to how much minority voters relied on early voting. "It’s troubling that by eliminating weekend voting hours, the state of Ohio specifically banned a popular voting time of choice for minorities," Fudge said. "In Cuyahoga County, which I represent, 56 percent of weekend voters in 2008 were African American while adult African Americans comprise 28 percent of the county population." PolitiFact Ohio thought Fudge’s data on African American use of in-person early voting warranted a closer look. Cuyahoga County, home to Cleveland and Fudge’s hometown of Warrensville Heights, is the most populous and had the largest voting population among Ohio counties in 2008. We asked Fudge’s office where she got her statistics. Her staff referred us to a research study on early voting by Case Western Reserve University emeritus professor Norman Robbins, and Cleveland State University urban affairs professor Mark Salling. Their study estimates that 56.4 percent of Cuyahoga county’s 2008 early-in-person voters were black. Of those who voted on election day or by mail, 25.7 percent of them were black. And specifically, the study found that on the four weekends prior to election day, 56 percent of the ballots were cast by black voters. White voters showed the reverse pattern, it said. They comprised 40 percent of early-in-person votes and 69.4 percent of those who voted on election day or by mail. The study said that 15.6 percent of all votes cast by African Americans in Cuyahoga County were through early-in-person voting, compared with 4.5 percent of votes by whites. The study also said that 28 percent of Cuyahoga county adults 18 and over are African American, as are 24 percent of voting age adults in Hamilton County (Cincinnati), and 20 percent each in Franklin (Columbus) and Montgomery (Dayton) counties. "We conclude that in Cuyahoga County, and quite probably in other counties with substantial black populations, elimination of ANY EIP (early-in-person) voting period clearly disproportionately affects African Americans in an election similar to 2008," the study said. In an email to PolitiFact Ohio, study co-author Robbins observed that African-American turnout was "disproportionately high and approximately the same, ranging from about 54 to 59 percent" during every early voting time period - business hours, extended weekday hours, weekends, or the last three days before the election. On the final weekend before election day, Robbins said, 58.9 percent of early in-person voters in Cuyahoga county were African-American. During the four weekends before that, he said 56.3 percent of voters were African-American. PolitiFact Ohio queried Cuyahoga County Election Board Director Jane Platten about the study’s statistics. She said she couldn’t evaluate its racial voting numbers because the county doesn’t collect data on the voters’ ethnicity. She said "a lot" of African Americans made use of the county’s early-in-person voting program, although she said she had "no idea" of the percentage. So how did the authors come up with their racial data? Although the county doesn’t track voters’ race, voter addresses are on file. The study’s authors used those addresses to determine the census block where voters reside, and extrapolated their race by using 2010 census data on each block’s racial makeup. For example, if a voter’s address was in a census block in which 75 percent of the population was black and 25 percent was white, that voter was considered to have a 75 percent probability of being black. Several independent demographics experts told PolitiFact Ohio this method would provide valid racial voting data. "I can’t think of a better way to do it, and I don’t think there would be any big errors in that method," said Carl Schmertmann, a Florida State University demography professor who formerly served on the U.S. Census Bureau’s scientific advisory committee. "The logic by which the authors attempt to estimate the race of early voters makes sense," agreed Scott Keeter, the Pew Research Center’s survey research director. Keeter noted that 2008 exit polling data in Ohio found that 16 percent of those who voted early - either by mail or in-person - were black voters, while 9 percent of in-person voters were black. "African-Americans statewide do appear to have made heavier use of early voting, but the exit poll did not ask how a vote was cast, so we can’t be sure that this pattern is mostly a result of EIP voting," said an email from Keeter. Robbins research, though, was able to break out the EIP population. Fudge drew her statistics, which she cited accurately, from a research study that stated that 56 percent of the 2008 Cuyahoga county voters voted who cast ballots on weekends before the election were African American and that 28 percent of the county’s voting age population is African American. On the Truth-O-Meter, Fudge’s claim rates True.	None	Marcia Fudge	None	None	None	2012-09-14T06:00:00	2012-08-24	['African_American']

pomt-01689	The wife of the Ferguson, Mo., police chief said African-Americans in Ferguson "are feral and violent."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/14/tweets/ferguson-police-chiefs-wife-calls-african-american/	The hacking collective known as Anonymous is trying to shine a light on the roots of the racial violence in a St. Louis suburb. On Aug. 13, the group published hours of alleged police dispatch tapes from the day Ferguson, Mo., police shot and killed unarmed teen Michael Brown. That same day, one of a handful of Twitter accounts claiming to be associated with the Anonymous group posted comments they say came from the wife of Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson. Speaking of people in Ferguson, a woman identified as Catherine Nardi wrote: "They are feral and violent. They murder each other. They murder their unborn babies. They murder white people. They hate police officers and murder some of them, even black ones. They destroy neighbors and entire cities with garbage and drugs. They live their lives off the hard-earned tax dollars of other Americans. Yet somehow they are victims. What insanity is that?" The comments have been retweeted more than 5,400 times. But the person in the Facebook message, Catherine Nardi, is not the wife of the Ferguson police chief. Nardi lives in St. Petersburg, Fla., not Missouri, according to public records. She is married to Henry Nardi, who is not the police chief of Ferguson. We reached out to Nardi via Facebook, but she did not respond. A woman answering a phone number associated with her hung up on a reporter. (Nardi removed her Facebook profile after this fact-check first published.) According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Jackson’s wife is named Patricia, not Catherine. We were unable to reach Jackson’s wife. As for the specific words in the message, we did not find them on Nardi’s Facebook page or anywhere else. Our ruling A post from a group claiming that it is associated with Anonymous said that the wife of the Ferguson, Mo., police chief said African-Americans in Ferguson "are feral and violent," among other things. The tweet references a Facebook post that is not from Jackson’s wife. The woman in the picture lives in Florida not Missouri. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-11899	Sarah Huckabee Sanders dressed up as KKK member on Halloween in 1993.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/23/blog-posting/no-sarah-huckabee-sanders-did-not-dress-kkk-member/	A photo of a young girl dressed in Ku Klux Klan attire purported to be Sarah Huckabee Sanders is making the rounds on Facebook. Don’t believe it. The photo was posted on the Facebook page Wake Up America and has over 2,700 shares. Red text on the photo purports it is Huckabee Sanders in Little Rock, Ark., on Halloween 1993. But it’s not. A reader asked us to look into the post to verify its accuracy. The photo shows a child who appears to be younger than Huckabee Sanders; she would have been 11. The person in the photo also does not resemble known childhood photos of Huckabee Sanders. More importantly, this photo already has been discredited on Snopes after it appeared on the satirical site FreeWoodPost.com in August 2012. A sloppily photoshopped Chick-fil-A sign had then been layered over the picture. That image accompanied a fake news story that purported Dan Cathy, the company’s president, had called for a racist controversy to stir up sales. The post followed news that counter-protests to Cathy’s opposition to gay marriage had caused a record spike in sales. "Let’s milk this for all its worth," the fake news story credited Cathy as saying. "Let’s wait until this gay thing dies down a little, then I will release another statement that says that we don’t like blacks either." Cathy confirmed to Snopes the marketing ploy was fake. We found versions of this same image appearing as far back as 2008, including on a Russian blog dezinfo.net. The Russian blog says the photos are part of a story of a woman who has been sewing KKK uniforms "for many years." That appears to track back to a Mother Jones photo essay of "Ms. Ruth," who reportedly "sews hoods and robes for Klan members seven days a week, blessing each one when it’s done." The photo essay, by New York photojournalist Anthony Karen, includes a photo of the same child. We took a screengrab below. The Facebook page manager told us they didn't know the image was fake. Our ruling An image circulating on Facebook purports to show White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dressed in a Klu Klux Klan robe. A Facebook caption to the newly surfaced image said, "The problem is not whether this photo is real or not -- it's that no one would be surprised in the slightest if it IS real." It’s definitely not.

pomt-02630	"The average rate of fraud" in the Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps programs "is 20 to 25 percent."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/20/ron-johnson/fraud-claims-20-25-cents-every-1-spent-four-govern/	Once a month, the Waukesha County Republican Party hosts "Pints and Politics," a Friday evening gathering at a suburban Milwaukee restaurant that is "open to anyone conservative." The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel covered the soiree on Jan. 10, 2014, when the special guest was U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. When a woman asked Johnson about the Internal Revenue Service enforcing provisions of the Affordable Care Act, he expressed doubt about how effective the IRS would be. Then Johnson made an allegation about government assistance programs that packed the punch of a beer and a shot. "Do you realize the average rate of fraud," Johnson asked, "whether it's in the Earned Income Tax Credit or Medicare or Medicaid, across the board, food stamps -- the average rate of fraud in those programs is 20 to 25 percent?" Fraud is sobering stuff. It’s defined as "the crime of using dishonest methods to take something valuable" from someone or something; and as the intentional use of "dishonest means to deprive another" of money, property or a legal right. Are errors made in the programs Johnson cited -- people who aren’t eligible still getting benefits, or getting more than they should? Sure -- tens of billions of dollars worth per year. But in terms of fraud, there’s no evidence the rate in the four programs is anywhere near 20 or 25 percent. Johnson’s response When we asked for evidence to back Johnson’s claim, Johnson policy advisor Patrick McIlheran told us the senator meant error rates in the various programs, not actual fraud. "The former is of interest to taxpayers, the latter is a matter for prosecutors," McIlheran said in an email. The next day, however, Johnson conceded he had erred -- even though he continued to use the term fraud. In a statement, Johnson said that when he made his claim, he was "primarily referencing fraud" in the Earned Income Tax Credit program. But, he added: "I made too broad a generalization to other mandatory spending programs based on reports in the press and from colleagues that are not supported by other inspector general reports. I strive hard to convey accurate information that is fully supportable, and I was mistaken in making this overly broad generalization," the statement read. "This inaccuracy, however, should not detract from the larger point I was trying to make: Fraud is a significant and serious problem." Johnson cited a U.S. Government Accountability Office report which said that in 2011, federal agencies estimated that $115.3 billion in improper payments were attributable to 79 programs spread among 17 agencies. The error rate was 4.7 percent. So, the senator admits his claim is false; let’s see just what the numbers are. Before we review each of the four programs Johnson singled out, it’s important to note the difference between fraud and error rates. As Malcolm Sparrow, a specialist in corruption control at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told PolitiFact National, fraud and improper payments are far from identical. "There is a serious problem with conflating these different types of overpayment," he said. We found that reviews done by federal agencies, as well as by independent offices such as inspectors general and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, do not cite rates of fraud. Rather, they document or estimate error rates -- how often benefits in various programs are overpaid or underpaid. Such improper payments can include instances of actual fraud, but by and large they cover errors, which can be made by government workers, service providers such as physicians, and by the benefit recipients themselves. Some of the errors could be intentional, such as a taxpayer claiming a credit he isn’t eligible for, but the nature of fraud makes it very difficult to quantify. In other instances, a caseworker might mistakenly arrange benefits for someone who isn’t eligible. Food stamps The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the food stamps program, said 3.8 percent of benefits were paid in error in 2011, according to a factcheck done by PolitiFact Texas in June 2013. The error rate covers both overpayments, including fraud, as well as underpayments. Caseworker mistakes, rather than fraud, were the primary cause. Six months later, we found, the USDA reported the error rate dropped to 3.42 percent in 2012, an all-time low. Medicare Another June 2013 factcheck, by PolitiFact National, found Medicare has an improper payment rate of 8 to 10 percent. We found that the improper payments rate for Medicare, the government health insurance program for Americans age 65 and older, was 10.1 percent in 2013, up from 8.5 percent the previous year, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Fraud makes up a relatively small portion of the improper payments, according to the factcheck done by PolitiFact National. More common are improper payments that are the result, for example, of a doctor ordering too many tests, or providing a service but submitting the wrong payment code. As for fraud in Medicare, "there are no reliable estimates" on how often it occurs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in an October 2013 report. Medicaid The rate of error payments in Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor, is lower than it is for Medicare. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimated overpayments and underpayments for Medicaid totaled $21.9 billion in 2011, an error rate of 8.1 percent, according to a March 2013 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office A different GAO report said Health and Human Services estimated error payments of $19.2 billion, or 7.1 percent, in 2012. That report notes that improper payment estimates reported by federal agencies "are not intended to be an estimate of fraud." Note: A 2012 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association offered three estimates of fraud (not error rates) in the Medicare and Medicaid programs: a low of 3 percent, a medium of 6 percent and a high of 10 percent. Earned Income Tax Credit The Earned Income Tax Credit gives a federal income tax credit to low- and moderate-wage workers. A taxpayer who gets the credit could owe less in income taxes or receive a larger tax refund. A February 2013 report from the U.S. Treasury’s inspector general said the IRS estimated that 21 to 25 percent of the payments it made in the program in 2012 -- between $11.6 billion and $13.6 billion-- were issued improperly. The IRS said faulty payments result from a variety of causes, including the complex nature of the law, the shifting EITC-eligible population and the nature of the credit. Eight months later, the inspector general said the estimated error rates were understated. And it bears repeating: these are error rates, not rates of fraud. Our rating Johnson said: "The average rate of fraud" in the Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps programs "is 20 to 25 percent." Improper payment rates are in the 20 to 25 percent range in the tax credit program -- but are 10 percent or less in the other three programs. So, even the average among the four programs would be far less than what Johnson claimed. More importantly, those are error rates; there are no figures on the rate of fraud, which is believed to be a small component of errors. Johnson’s remark to the group was grossly misleading. For a claim that is false and ridiculous, we give Johnson a Pants on Fire. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.

pomt-06013	U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher is "the only working farmer currently serving in the House."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/17/corn-commentary/corn-growers-association-blog-laments-congress-has/	We know it's been a while since the United States was truly an agrarian society, but is it possible that, of the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, just one is a "working farmer" -- U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher? That's the claim made by Corn Commentary, an online newsletter of the National Corn Growers Association. Its headline, "Only Farmer in Congress wants to wait on Farm Bill" has been featured in the "In The News" feed that runs prominently on the "About Me" section of Fincher’s website. Back in July, Corn Commentary caught up with Fincher, R-Tenn., at the Southern Peanut Growers Conference. It wanted to ask the Northwest Tennessee representative about his concern "about cuts in agricultural funding being considered at the federal level" and referred to the freshman lawmaker in the article as "sadly the only working farmer currently serving in the House." Sad maybe, but also unlikely, it seemed to us, given the number of rural districts represented in the House of Representatives. So we set out to find out whether Fincher, of Frog Jump, Tenn., is in fact the only working farmer now serving. That Fincher is running a headline that says "Only Farmer in Congress . . . " next to a big photo of himself on his website also strikes us as an implicit endorsement of the statement, though we could not find any other evidence of him making the claim independently. A working farmer would, we figured, be someone who gets involved in farm operations, drives a tractor, tends to fence posts, and is known down the blacktop at the local feed store. Fincher clearly meets those specifications. But a quick call to the House Agriculture Committee, where Fincher served briefly before taking a seat on the Financial Services Committee, revealed that its chairman, Frank Lucas, R-Okla., considers himself a fifth generation farmer and runs a cattle operation. There’s more: ● Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., is a co-owner of Stutzman Farms in Howe, where he farms 4,000 acres with his brothers and brothers-in-law, growing soybeans, green beans and seed corn. Stutzman’s spokesman James Wegmann reports that the congressman sets aside "combine time" during the harvest season and is very much involved in the operation. ● Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo., lives on a working farm in Cass County, served on the Missouri Farm Bureau and owns businesses that sell farm equipment. Her spokesman, Steven S. Walsh, said she "can, indeed, be considered a working farmer." Two others have extensive experience on the farm although they no longer claim to be "working farmers." ● According to his House bio, Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, is a "self-employed farmer, predominately (sic) producing market hogs" for three decades. But spokeswoman Catherine Gatewood said in an email update that Gibbs is "technically not a working farmer anymore as he sold his operation!" ● Christine Noem, R-S.D., described on her official site as a "farmer and hunting lodge owner and operator" -- and who was twice named South Dakota’s Outstanding Young Farmer before entering Congress -- is no longer actively involved in farming, according to her spokesman, Josh Shields. She sold off the last of her cattle and her brothers and sisters now do the actual farming, he said. We were also curious how many members of Congress look like farmers on paper by receiving U.S. Agriculture Department payments for farm operations they may not actually actively farm. For that we turned to the Washington-based Environmental Working Group, which for years has maintained a database of crop subsidy payments obtained from the USDA through a Freedom of Information Act request. Earlier this year, EWG noted that 23 members of the 112th Congress, including five senators, have received farm program payments since 1995. Corn Commentary says Fincher is the only working farmer in the House, and in an emailin response to a PolitiFact inquiry, reporter Cindy Zimmerman doubled-down: "To my knowledge, the other members of Congress who claim agriculture as a ‘profession’ are investors or part-timers." Our Ruling Several other House members seem comfortable with manure on their work boots and do work farms when back home in their districts. They have the added cachet of actually serving on the committee overseeing farm programs, which Fincher does not. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10122	"The truth was revealed there in that report that showed there was no unlawful or unethical activity on my part."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/14/sarah-palin/report-finds-palin-violated-ethics-laws/	In the scouring of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s political closet, perhaps no issue has loomed as large as "Troopergate" — the allegations that Palin improperly exerted her influence as governor to try to get her estranged former brother-in-law fired from his job as a state trooper. Alaska State Trooper Mike Wooten was involved in a messy divorce from Palin’s sister, and opponents claimed that Palin went so far as to fire the state’s top cop, Walt Monegan, in July because he refused to fire Wooten. Alaska's 12-member Legislative Council — which has a Republican majority — decided to look into the matter, and in early August, they tapped independent investigator Stephen Branchflower to lead the probe. Branchflower’s report , released Oct. 10, concluded that while Palin was within her rights to fire Monegan, she "abused her power" and ran afoul of state ethics laws in seeking to settle a score with Wooten. The Palin camp predictably lambasted the report as a partisan smear. Less predictable was the reaction from Palin herself. "The truth was revealed there in that report that showed there was no unlawful or unethical activity on my part," Palin told reporters on Oct. 11. Except that’s not what the report showed. "Finding Number One" of the report is "that Governor Sarah Palin abused her power by violating Alaska Statute 39.52.110(a) of the Alaska Branch Ethics Act ." Specifically, the statute reads: "The legislature reaffirms that each public officer holds office as a public trust, and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust." Branchflower concluded that while Monegan’s refusal to fire Trooper Michael Wooten "was not the sole reason he was fired by Governor Sarah Palin, it was likely a contributing factor to his termination as Commissioner of Public Safety." "In spite of that, Governor Palin’s firing of Commissioner Monegan was a proper and lawful exercise of her constitutional and statutory authority to hire and fire executive branch department heads," the report states. When a reporter on Oct. 11 asked, "Governor, did you abuse your power?" Palin said, "No, and if you read the report you’ll see that there was nothing unlawful or unethical about replacing a cabinet member. You gotta read the report, sir." Yes, but when you do read the report, Palin's take on its findings falls apart. As the report explains, in 2005 the Palins lodged numerous complaints against trooper Wooten, including that he made death threats against Palin’s father, Tasered his 10-year-old stepson, drove his patrol car after drinking and ran down and killed a wolf with his snow machine. State troopers investigated his behavior and Wooten was suspended for five days in 2006, before Palin became governor. As far as Monegan was concerned, that should have been the end of it. But according to the report, Palin and her husband continued to aggressively push for Wooten's ouster after Palin became governor. "The evidence supports the conclusion that Governor Palin, at the least, engaged in ‘official action’ by her inaction if not her active participation or assistance to her husband in attempting to get Trooper Wooten fired (and there is ample evidence of her participation)," the report states. " She knowingly...permitted Todd Palin to use the Governor’s office and the resources of the Governor’s office, including access to state employees, to continue to contact subordinate state employees in an effort to find some way to get Trooper Wooten fired." The report also chides Palin for declining to be interviewed by the investigator. "An interview would have assisted everyone to better understand her motives and perhaps explain why she was so apparently intent upon getting Trooper Wooten fired in spite of the fact she knew he had been disciplined following the Administrative Investigation," the report states. "She also knew that he has been permitted to keep his job, and that the disciplinary investigation was closed and could not be reopened. Yet she allowed pressure from her husband, to try to get Trooper Wooten fired, to continue unabated over a several month-period of time." Branchflower also concluded that Palins’ claims that they feared Wooten "were not bona fide and were offered to provide cover for the Palin’s real motivation: to get Trooper Wooten fired for personal family related reasons." In a telephone interview with Alaska reporters on Oct. 11, Palin said she was "very very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing … any hint of any kind of unethical activity there. Very pleased to be cleared of any of that. Todd did what anyone would have done given this state trooper’s very, very troubling behavior and his dangerous threats against our family. Todd did what I think any Alaskan would do." In Altoona, Pa., outside a Sheetz gas station, Palin again claimed the report found she had done nothing illegal or unethical. "I’m thankful that the report has shown that, that there was no illegal or unethical activity there in my choice to replace our commissioner," she said. "I don’t micromanage my commissioners and ask them to hire or fire anyone,," Palin said, "and thankfully the truth was revealed there in that report, that showed that there was no unlawful nor unethical activity on my part." Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt told ABC News that when Palin says she’s been cleared of any legal or ethical violations, "She was referring to the conclusion of the report that found that she acted properly and lawfully with regard to reassigning Monegan, which was the original purpose of the investigation." The report did, in fact, find that Palin’s firing of Monegan was "lawful and proper" but when Palin says - repeatedly - that the report found "no unlawful or unethical behavior,"she is ignoring the part of the report that concluded she abused her power as governor and violated state ethics laws. Palin has attacked the investigation as a "partisan circus" and spokeswoman Meg Stapleton claimed the legislative council "seriously overreached, making a tortured argument to find fault without basis in law or fact." The campaign also notes that the council made clear that the vote to make the report public was not an endorsement of its findings, and that five members of the council spoke up to say they did not agree with the report’s findings. Those all may be legitimate arguments, or not. But the issue here is Palin’s characterization that the report concluded that she did not do anything ethically wrong. The report concluded just the opposite. The report says she did abuse her authority and she did violate state ethics laws. By saying otherwise repeatedly, in what seems to be a deliberate attempt to mislead or confuse voters who don't know the facts, Palin isn't just wrong, she's Pants on Fire! wrong.

pomt-08334	Bill Heller "raises taxes. Property taxes. Small business taxes. He even wants to tax the Internet. Mr. Heller said no to balancing the federal budget, that puts more debt on our kids."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/28/jeff-brandes/jeff-brandes-accuses-incumbent-state-rep-bill-hell/	Republican Jeff Brandes wants voters to believe two-term state Rep. Bill Heller will be trouble for their pocketbooks and kids' future. A 30-second Brandes television ad opens at a school, where two girls recognize Brandes from other ads before cutting to the candidate: "My opponent Bill Heller thinks government is the answer to everything. So he raises taxes. Property taxes. Small business taxes. He even wants to tax the Internet. That's just wrong." The ad, produced with help from the Republican Party of Florida, warns that Heller will drive up taxes and pile debt on children if the Democrat wins the Nov. 2, 2010, election for House District 52. "Mr. Heller said no to balancing the federal budget, that puts more debt on our kids. Florida voters are in a foul mood over taxes and spending, so we decided to check Brandes' claims about Heller's support of tax increases. Brandes cited an array of votes, including a referendum in Pinellas County and five votes in the Florida House: On property taxes, Heller did support a 2004 referendum in Pinellas County to raise property taxes to increase teacher pay by providing $26 million at the time in additional revenue. Voters overwhelmingly passed it. Heller wasn't in the House then, but he chaired the campaign supporting the measure. The measure raised taxes 50 cents for every $1,000 of taxable value. At the time, the owner of a $150,000 home with a $25,000 homestead exemption would pay an extra $62.50 a year. However, Heller also voted for a 2007 measure that voters later approved to cut property taxes by doubling the $25,000 homestead exemption. It was estimated to drop the average tax bill $240 at the time, though savings depended on individual property assessments. (Heller earlier had voted against an initial version of the bill, and a judge later threw it out.) On businesses, Heller voted for Senate Bill 810 in 2009 that extended unemployment compensation for Floridians up to 20 weeks. It also raised the tax that businesses have to pay into the fund for unemployment assistance. After Republicans successfully turned back attempts to accept $444 million in stimulus money, the bill passed with a 117-0 vote. Heller also has supported legislation imposing a state sales tax on Internet transactions. Brick and mortar businesses have to charge sales tax, but Florida does not collect it from online shops such as Amazon. It amounts to hundreds of millions in lost revenue. But the bills in the House and Senate died in committee in 2010 with little debate. But the other claims that Brandes makes are less grounded in reality. Heller voted against a federal balanced budget measure in 2010, but it was a non-binding resolution asking Congress to call a constitutional convention for an amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. The measure carried no weight, as the Florida House doesn't have any control over the federal budget, let alone did it add debt on children. The resolution passed the House, 70-42, and the Senate, 28-12. It did not require the governor's signature. While Heller did vote in 2009 and 2010 against budget bills that included annual 7 percent pay cuts for lawmakers, he actually voted for the cut in 2010 when it was approved as an amendment. The amendment for the 2009 cut was approved without a roll call vote, meaning it had little controversy. The pay cuts were approved in the budget and were signed into law by Gov. Charlie Crist each year. So while Heller has supported tax increases, Brandes inaccurately describes the gravity and actual effect of Heller's votes on the federal budget. We rate Brandes' claims on taxes Mostly True.	None	Jeff Brandes	None	None	None	2010-10-28T16:35:09	2010-10-12	['None']

pomt-06470	"If a President Romney got a call from the president of the (Mormon church), he has no choice but to obey. It is obedience over family and country."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/fred-karger/fred-karger-says-mitt-romney-would-have-put-loyalt/	In a comment published in The Guardian, a British newspaper, little-known Republican presidential candidate Fred Karger took aim at Mitt Romney for his Mormon faith. Romney is among the first Mormons to have a serious shot at winning the presidency. Karger -- a gay Republican who has attracted little support in the polls -- suggested that, as president, Romney would face a conflict between the duties of his office and Mormon religion, also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS. "My major concern with the Mormon faith is the basic tenet of obedience," Karger told the newspaper. "If a President Romney got a call from the president of the LDS, he has no choice but to obey. It is obedience over family and country." Karger's remarks brought to mind an earlier debate in 1960 over whether John F. Kennedy would put allegiance to the Pope first. Kennedy took those concerns head on in a Sept. 12, 1960, speech to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association and went on to win the election. To make sure Karger wasn’t misquoted, we contacted his campaign. Spokeswoman Rina Shah confirmed the authenticity of the quote. She also provided an additional statement from Karger. "I have researched the LDS church and many of its beliefs over the past three years," Karger said in a statement to PolitiFact. "Obedience is absolute. I have been told this in no uncertain terms by many Mormons and ex-Mormons. This life is merely a test of that. Look into the recent church campaign to get Switzerland to not ban LDS missionaries from its country." (Here is a statement by the church and some of the news coverage of the dispute with Switzerland.) So is Karger’s claim that Romney would have to obey church over state accurate? First, we’ll note that the church takes up this issue explicitly on its website. "The church’s mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, not to elect politicians," the site says. "The church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is neutral in matters of party politics. This applies in all of the many nations in which it is established." The statement goes on to say that "the church does not … attempt to direct or dictate to a government leader." It adds, "Elected officials who are Latter-day Saints make their own decisions and may not necessarily be in agreement with one another or even with a publicly stated church position. While the church may communicate its views to them, as it may to any other elected official, it recognizes that these officials still must make their own choices based on their best judgment and with consideration of the constituencies whom they were elected to represent." When we contacted the LDS church, spokesman Lyman Kirkland had a one-sentence reply: "Mr. Karger’s assertions are simply ridiculous." We also reached three scholars of Mormon theology and history, and all agreed that Karger’s concerns were misplaced. Here are some of their reactions to Karger’s statement. Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond and author of such books as People of Paradox: A History of Mormon Culture and By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World Religion: "There is no basis in fact for the claim that Romney would have ‘no choice but to obey’ if he got a call from the LDS church president. On the rare occasion when church presidents make pronouncements on issues with political implications, such as a statement against abortion, or against the MX missile system, church members are free to act in compliance or in disregard for such pronouncements. No member has been disciplined for his or her political conduct, as the distribution of both Mormon voters and politicians across the political spectrum proves." Laurie Maffly-Kipp, adjunct professor of American studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and author of Proclamation to the People: 19th Century Mormonism and the Pacific Basin Frontier: "It is his own interpretation of what Mormons do, not a policy or doctrine in the church. Members are always reminded that the dictates of their own conscience are paramount. A good example of this was when Mitt Romney's father, George, as governor of Michigan in 1964, supported the passage of a civil rights bill even when leaders in the LDS church wrote to him advising against it. As the church elder admitted in the letter he wrote to Gov. Romney, ‘I cannot deny you the right of your position if it represents your true belief and feelings.’ "(The letter is available here.) Grant Hardy, professor of history and religious studies at the University of North Carolina (Asheville) and author of Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader's Guide: "The statement attributed to Fred Karger is not true. … Mr. Karger's quote may come from a misunderstanding of the LDS temple. Mormon temples are only open to members of the church who have a current temple ‘recommend,’ and one of the questions that must be answered positively to receive a recommend is, ‘Do you sustain the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the prophet, seer, and revelator, and as the only person on earth who possesses and is authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?’ But the word ‘sustain’ does not mean ‘obey’ or even ‘agree with in every particular.’ There is a long tradition in Mormonism of valuing agency and individual conscience. Similarly, in the temple ceremony itself, Latter-day Saints make a covenant of obedience, but it is obedience to God rather than obedience to the prophet or to the church. "So if a President Romney got a call from the president of the LDS church -- which I don't think would ever happen -- he would not be required by the tenets of his faith to put obedience to the church over his duty to his country or his office." Hardy offered as an example the battle over Proposition 8 -- a California ballot initiative that barred same-sex marriage in the state. It passed with 52 percent of the vote in 2008, thanks in part to the strong support of the Mormon church. "The church was strongly involved in their vocal support of Proposition 8," Hardy said. "A majority of active members responded to the church's call to action, but those who did not, or who opposed the measure, remain Latter-day Saints in good standing." (Karger was the founder of Californians Against Hate -- an opponent of Proposition 8. In that capacity, he "led four boycotts and filed formal ethics violation complaints leading to investigations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," according to Karger’s resume.) Our ruling We don't see any evidence that Karger is correct that "if a President Romney got a call from the president of the (Mormon church), he has no choice but to obey. It is obedience over family and country." The church itself says in no uncertain terms that that’s not the case, and three scholars of the religion agree. The inflammatory nature of Karger’s charge rates it a Pants on Fire.	None	Fred Karger	None	None	None	2011-10-18T19:23:37	2011-10-15	['None']
pomt-14199	"Under the federal Controlled Substance Act, marijuana is listed in the same Schedule I as heroin," even though "marijuana is not a killer drug like heroin."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/22/bernie-sanders/hitting-war-drugs-bernie-sanders-says-us-puts-mari/	Campaigning for president in the liberal oasis of Madison, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont rose to the defense of marijuana. Critical of the nation’s war on drugs, Sanders said the lives of millions of Americans have been "ruined" because they got a police record for possessing marijuana. "Today, under the federal Controlled Substance Act, marijuana is listed in the same Schedule I as heroin. That is nuts," Sanders declared March 26, 2016, 10 days before he defeated Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin’s Democratic primary. "Now people can argue -- although I suspect in this audience there may not be much of an argument -- about the pluses and minuses of marijuana," he said, drawing cheers from some of the thousands in attendance at the Alliant Energy Center. "But everybody knows marijuana is not a killer drug like heroin." Sanders then noted he had introduced legislation to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substance Act because possession of it "should not be a federal crime." We found that Sanders wasn’t smoking anything funny in claiming that both marijuana and heroin are Schedule I drugs, which he has continued to say while campaigning in New York and Pennsylvania. But his claim is somewhat misleading: That classification is based on a drug’s acceptable medical use and the drug’s abuse or dependency potential, not on criminal statutes. The law The Controlled Substance Act, adopted in 1970, uses five schedules to classify drugs and narcotics by medical use and potential to incite substance abuse. On the low end is Schedule V, which includes substances such as cough medicines with small amounts of the narcotic codeine. At the high end is Schedule I, which lists the "most dangerous" drugs -- those that have "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse." Marijuana is stronger than when the Controlled Substance Act was adopted (as ex-GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina correctly stated). Nevertheless Schedule II includes some drugs often considered more dangerous than marijuana. Here’s a look at some of the drugs in the two schedules: Schedule I Schedule II Marijuana Cocaine Heroin Methamphetamine LSD Methadone Ecstasy OxyContin Peyote Fentanyl The Huffington Post in April 2016, citing figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the nation recorded no marijuana overdose deaths in 2015. Likewise, there were zero in 2014. It’s possible marijuana might soon be moved off of Schedule I. A week after Sanders’ speech, the Washington Post reported that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said it hopes to decide by July 2016 whether to change the federal status of marijuana. Now let’s get to Sanders’ implication that the schedule relates to criminal law enforcement. Marijuana treated differently Distribution, manufacturing or possession of a Schedule I substance is indeed a federal offense. Additionally, marijuana being on Schedule I, drug policy experts told us, makes it more difficult for licensed dealers in states that have legalized marijuana or medical marijuana to get bank accounts and to deduct business expenses on their taxes. And the classification makes it more difficult for researchers to study marijuana in clinical trials. But judges come down harder on heroin possession than marijuana possession. And when it comes to enforcement of criminal statutes, the federal government to some extent has looked the other way when it comes to marijuana. As PolitiFact National stated in a related fact check: Schedule I substances cannot legally be used for medical purposes, however, 20 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana. In 2009, the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, told federal law enforcement agencies to stop targeting medical marijuana dispensaries, signaling a change from the approach of Obama’s predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush. Similarly, in 2013, the Department of Justice said it would not target new laws in Colorado and Washington legalizing recreational marijuana. While Sanders equates the handling or marijuana and heroin, it’s difficult to imagine the federal government not enforcing the law if states started legalizing heroin. Our rating Criticizing the nation’s war on drugs, Sanders says that under the federal Controlled Substance Act, "marijuana is listed in the same Schedule I as heroin," even though "marijuana is not a killer drug like heroin." Like heroin, marijuana is indeed listed as a Schedule I drug, the federal designation given to drugs considered the most dangerous. But at least under the Obama administration, the federal government doesn’t treat it as one under the law. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/046c4622-acb2-422a-b6cd-ffa78af57f99	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-22T05:00:00	2016-03-26	['None']

We’ve previously debunked the theory Hogg is a crisis actor, but we decided to take a closer look at the purported yearbook evidence. "I went to school with him at Redondo Shores High School and he graduated in 2015," the tweet said. "Here he is in our yearbook from 2015. He always wanted to work for CNN and be an actor. #GunReformNow #NeverAgain" But the image accompanying the tweet is taken from the 2017 Stoneman High School yearbook. Joey Wong, a student at the Parkland, Fla., high school, posted a video of his yearbook on Twitter showing the cover and the page from the viral image. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "Okay, so, what we have here is a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School yearbook from the school year 2017, Florida, and bookmarked is David Hogg’s yearbook photo from the same book," Wong says in the video. "David Hogg, 11th grade. This is last year. He’s right here. That’s him." Another student, Sarah Chadwick, echoed Wong’s confirmation in another tweet. "She claims it’s not a Douglas yearbook (which I promise it is, I know multiple people in that picture) yet there’s someone in the pic wearing a douglas t-shirt????" Chadwick tweeted. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Hogg did not graduate from a California high school in 2015; in fact, he was on the cross country team at Stoneman that year. The Sun-Sentinel published a photo of one of his races. Hogg did, however, live in California prior to Florida. His father, Kevin Hogg, was an FBI agent assigned to the Los Angeles International Airport before his retirement to Florida in 2014. According to a tweet by Daniel Williams, a fellow student, Hogg moved to Florida their freshman year and has not transferred since.

pomt-11260	Says illegal immigration is "costing us $130 billion a year to house and feed and give benefits to people that shouldn’t be even in the country."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/30/don-blankenship/don-blankenship-claims-illegal-immigration-costs-1/	Seeking to represent West Virginia in the U.S. Senate, former coal mining executive Don Blankenship called for an end to illegal immigration, saying it costs billions of dollars a year. "We have to stop illegal immigration, costing us $130 billion a year to house and feed and give benefits to people that shouldn’t be even in the country," Blankenship said during an April 23 debate among Republican primary candidates. We wanted to know the facts behind Blankenship’s claim on the cost of illegal immigration. Blankenship’s statement stems from a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) that said illegal immigration costs about $135 billion a year. The group favors stricter immigration policies. The report has drawn criticism for some of its assumptions, such as a higher-than-usual estimate of immigrants in the country illegally (12.5 million, higher than the typically reported 11 million) and for excluding tax contributions made by U.S.-born children to parents here illegally. Overall, it’s difficult to determine a precise cost of illegal immigration due to lack of reliable data. Report did not focus on housing costs FAIR’s report said illegal immigration costs about $135 billion a year, and that immigrants who are here illegally contribute about $19 billion in taxes annually. That puts net costs at about $116 billion a year. Blankenship said illegal immigration must be stopped because it costs $130 billion a year to house, feed and give benefits to people who shouldn’t even be in the United States. But FAIR’s report did not include estimates for the cost of public housing benefits, citing a lack of reliable information. The group also noted most welfare programs are not available to immigrants in the country illegally. But the group factored in costs for programs that benefit children born in the United States to parents here illegally. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized FAIR for calculating welfare used by U.S.-born children, but failing to add in their potential tax contributions once they start working. "Counting the benefits consumed but ignoring the tax revenue they pay (or will do so in the future) is one way FAIR gets such a negative result for this report," Nowrasteh wrote in a September 2017 post enumerating flaws in the report. FAIR estimated that the welfare of illegal immigration amounts to about $5.8 billion a year at the federal level and $2.9 billion a year at the state level (including school meals and child care programs). Experts' critique We asked more experts about the validity of FAIR’s findings. Their estimate is reasonable, though the cost could be more or could be less, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels. Even though most immigrants living illegally in the United States come to work and pay billions in taxes, that does not make them a net fiscal benefit, Camarota said. Other experts said there were flaws. For one, the report’s bottom line included federal immigration enforcement costs. "It seems ridiculous to attribute the costs of border security to unauthorized immigrants. Would people prefer we had no border security so then the costs of unauthorized immigration would be lower?" said Madeline Zavodny, an immigration expert and economics professor at the University of North Florida. Enforcement is aimed not only at reducing unauthorized immigration but also at reducing drug smuggling and trafficking, Zavodny said. Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said, "They are doing things in a way to try to exaggerate what the possible cost could be." FAIR also factored in about $3.5 billion for assumed Medicaid fraud. We’ve fact-checked several other claims about the cost of illegal immigration based on FAIR’s reports, with experts raising concerns about their methodology and assumptions. In 2016, we rated Mostly False a claim from then-presidential candidate Donald Trump when he claimed that illegal immigration cost the United States more than $113 billion a year, finding that he selected the highest of all possible estimates from a range that varied widely. Our ruling Blankenship said, "We have to stop illegal immigration, costing us $130 billion a year to house and feed and give benefits to people that shouldn’t be even in the country." Immigrants in the country illegally generate costs for taxpayers, but it’s difficult to determine a precise figure largely because there isn’t reliable data. Blankenship’s claim is based on a 2017 FAIR report estimating illegal immigration cost about $135 billion a year. Experts picked apart many aspects of the report’s methodology. But relevant to Blankenship’s statement, the group’s estimate did not factor in housing costs. For all welfare costs brought on by illegal immigration, FAIR calculated about $5.8 billion a year at the federal level and $2.9 billion a year at the state level (including school meals and child care programs). Blankenship’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04283	Says Mitt Romney wants to "get rid of Planned Parenthood."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/nov/02/planned-parenthood-action-fund/radio-ad-says-mitt-romney-wants-get-rid-planned-pa/	In the final days of the 2012 presidential campaign, the Planned Parenthood Action fund released a radio ad in which a female narrator explains why she is supporting President Barack Obama. "I’ve been giving my vote a lot of thought," the ad says in part. "For me, it all comes down to who I can trust, and who’s best for my family’s finances. And I just don’t think Mitt Romney is looking out for us. Plus, his views on women seem like they’re from the 1950s. He won’t say if he supports equal pay. That’s real money to us. And he says he wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade and get rid of Planned Parenthood. I know women who go to them for health care and affordable birth control." In this item, we’ll focus on the ad’s claim that Romney wants to "get rid of Planned Parenthood." Abortion opponents argue that federal funds should not go to a group like Planned Parenthood that provides abortions, even though federal funds are used for services other than abortion. Romney made a pledge to target Planned Parenthood several times -- but that pledge has never been as sweeping as the ad indicates. In October 2012, for instance, Romney told reporters in Ohio, "I think I’ve said time and again that I’m a pro-life candidate and I’ll be a pro-life president. The actions I’ll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget." And in March 2012, when asked by a Missouri interviewer what he would cut from the federal budget, Romney gave some examples. "Of course you get rid of Obamacare," Romney said. "That’s the easy one. But there are others. Planned Parenthood. We’re going to get rid of that. The subsidy for Amtrak. We would eliminate that." Campaign officials clarified after the Missouri interview -- and confirmed to PolitiFact for this story -- that Romney’s position is to eliminate federal payments to Planned Parenthood, but not to eliminate the organization. So the ad is wrong to say that Romney wants to "get rid of Planned Parenthood." But is there a case that federal funding is so crucial to Planned Parenthood that it would be essentially crippled if federal funding went away? Planned Parenthood comes close to making this case. "If a ‘President’ Romney makes good on what he’s promised during the campaign — after he ends safe and legal abortion, cuts off funding for women’s preventive health care services, repeals the Affordable Care Act, and enacts abstinence-only sex education — there wouldn’t be much left of Planned Parenthood," said a statement provided to PolitiFact attributed to Dawn Laguens, executive vice president, Planned Parenthood Action Fund. We can’t predict the future, but we can provide some financial data that gives a sense of how important government funding is to Planned Parenthood. According to the group’s most recent annual report, covering the year ending in June 2010, "government health services grants and reimbursements" amounted to $487 million, or 46 percent of the group’s total revenue of $1.048 billion. (This figure includes both Planned Parenthood’s headquarters as well as its affiliates.) The other sources of revenue listed were "non-governmental health services revenue" (31 percent), "private contributions and bequests" (21 percent) and "other operating revenue" (2 percent). There are some important caveats about these figures. Romney was talking about the federal budget, but the "government" line in Planned Parenthood’s revenue statement includes funding from all levels of government, not just the federal government. Planned Parenthood did not provide PolitiFact with a more detailed breakdown of its government revenues, but we can obtain some clues from a 2010 study by the Government Accountability Office. In 2008, the most recent year for which GAO had full data, Planned Parenthood reported federal spending totaling $88.7 million. The biggest single amount was for services funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration, which directly funds low-income and rural health centers and runs such programs as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program. Smaller amounts included funds for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2008, according to that year’s annual report, Planned Parenthood reported receiving about $349 million in government grants. By this measure, then, the federal funds cited by GAO accounted for about one-quarter of all government funds reported by the organization that year. The percentage may actually be higher. As we have previously noted, the GAO report counts only direct federal funding and does not appear to include reimbursements for patient services made through Medicaid or other federal health care programs. The group said that Medicaid patients account for about half of its patients, and if you include those who are funded by other federal programs, the percentage rises to two-thirds. Figuring out how much "government funding" could conceivably be eliminated by Romney if he wins office is mostly guesswork. But the hit to Planned Parenthood from Romney’s elimination could range from a 12 percent reduction in its entire budget to perhaps a 35 percent cut. Would cutting that amount of funding from Planned Parenthood’s budget effectively end the organization? That would be speculation -- but that speculation runs contrary to what Romney has said on multiple occasions. Our ruling The Planned Parenthood Action Fund aid said that Romney wants to "get rid of Planned Parenthood." That directly contradicts what Romney has said -- that he wants to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, not abolish the organization -- and his staff reaffirmed that position. There’s no question that an end to federal funding would be a significant blow to the organization’s operations, potentially chopping 12 percent to 35 percent from its budget. But it’s an exaggeration to say that Romney would act to "get rid" of the organization. We rate the claim Mostly False. UPDATE: After our story appeared, Planned Parenthood provided some additional statistics about how many Medicaid patients use their services. The story has been updated to include that data.

pomt-13415	Says Marco Rubio voted "against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe. He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/sep/22/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-attacks-marco-rubio-votting-against/	When U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio unveiled a gun safety bill Sept. 15, his Democratic rival for re-election attacked him for failing to support important gun safety legislation months earlier. "After the tragedy in Orlando, Rubio used the deaths of 49 innocent Floridians to run for re-election while voting against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe," U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy said in a campaign statement. "He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns." Rubio, a Republican, has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Murphy has been endorsed by the Pride Fund to end Gun Violence, an LGBT group formed after the June 12 Orlando mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Rubio voted for and against gun bills following the shooting, including those related to the no-fly list, a subset of the terrorist watch list. One vote was a procedural move against a Republican-sponsored compromise effort that failed. Gun safety bills in the Senate On June 20, the Senate voted on four amendments aimed to strengthen background checks and make it harder for terrorists or suspected terrorists to buy guns. All four were rejected largely on party lines. Rubio voted against the legislation written by Democrats — a background check amendment by Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy and an amendment by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein to ban known or suspected terrorists from buying a gun. He voted in favor of the Republican versions: a background check amendment by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and an amendment about the terrorism watch list by Texas Sen. John Cornyn. Unlike Feinstein’s bill, which would have placed a blanket ban on gun purchases by people who are terrorists or suspected terrorists, Cornyn’s measure would have placed a three-day hold on such sales, allowing the government to make a case in court against the sale showing the person is involved in terrorism or will commit terrorism. Rubio said he supported Cornyn’s legislation because it would ensure "Second Amendment rights are not denied unless terrorism suspicions are adjudicated by a court, following actual notice and a hearing." Murphy's campaign argues that Cornyn's bill requiring the federal government to show probable cause in court sets an unworkable standard of proof for law enforcement in court. (Under current law, being on a government terrorist watch list is not an automatic reason to be denied the right to buy a gun; however, the FBI is notified. There have to be other disqualifying factors, such as a felony conviction or being an undocumented immigrant.) These were not the bills Murphy was talking about. Murphy was referring to a compromise crafted by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. Collins’ amendment proposed to ban people from buying guns if they were on the no-fly list or the "selectee list," which means they undergo additional screening before boarding a plane. Those who were banned from buying guns could appeal in court. The amendment had 12 cosponsors: seven Democrats, four Republicans and one independent. On June 23, a motion to table the legislation failed with a 46-52 vote. That left the amendment still pending, but it showed that her legislation was short of the 60 votes required to advance — and it never did. The question was a motion to table, so when Rubio voted "yea" he was voting against the amendment. Eight Republicans voted against tabling the legislation. Rubio cosponsored another Republican alternative from Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. That proposal would have also blocked those on a terrorist list from buying guns but delayed the sale for three days with the possibility of an extension to allow for an investigation. Then it required a hearing before a judge to block the person from buying a gun. It failed 67-31. A day before the vote on the Collins amendment, Rubio told reporters that it was a "difficult balancing act" to bar terrorists from getting guns while protecting constitutional rights. "They’re trying to do it all in a hurry here, and I think we need to get it right," he said. After the vote, Rubio told CNN that he was concerned about how much money a gun buyer would have to spend on an appeal. "If you erroneously end up on a no-fly list, or a selectee list, unless you can come up with $10,000 or $15,000 to hire a lawyer, even if you get your fees back upfront, it’s going to be hard and intimidating to go to a federal court," he said. On Sept. 15, Rubio unveiled his own bill that would allow the U.S. attorney general to delay a firearms' purchase for up to three days and file an emergency court petition if someone previously investigated for terrorism tried to buy a gun. The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had previously been placed on a terrorist watch list in 2013 and was investigated by the FBI but he was never charged and later removed from the list. After the gun legislation in the Senate died in June, the House didn’t take the bills up for a vote. Murphy cosponsored a bill requiring the FBI be notified when individuals under a terrorism investigation and those formerly under investigation purchase firearms or explosives. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., introduced a similar version in the Senate, but neither bill has reached a vote. Was Collins’ amendment bipartisan? Murphy called Collins’ amendment bipartisan, and in many ways it seems as though it was: It was written by a Republican, drew four Republican cosponsors along with seven Democrats, and attracted eight GOP members’ support in the procedural vote against tabling it. The U.S. Senate has 54 Republicans and 45 Democrats (including one independent, Bernie Sanders, who pursued the Democratic presidential nomination). There is no pure definition of what can be called a "bipartisan" piece of legislation but you know it when you see it, said David Hawkings, senior editor of CQ Roll Call, a publication that tracks votes and legislation. "It’s an evolving definition -- as Congress gets more and more polarized on party lines even a handful crossing going against the grain makes it bipartisan," he said. "It’s situational." Hawkings said he would consider Collins’ amendment bipartisan. "In that case it was an effort by Collins, obviously a Republican, who was trying to put together enough Republicans to go against the wishes of their own leadership and go with Democrats to advance this," he said. Laurel Harbridge, a political scientist at Northwestern University who recently wrote a book about bipartisanship, says that a bill is "bipartisan" if at least 20 percent of a bill's cosponsors hail from the opposite party as the sponsor. So Collins’ amendment would meet that definition. "In today's polarized Congress any measure that picks up any support from the other side of the aisle might be deemed bipartisan -- especially on a particularly salient and charged issue like gun control," George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder said. Our ruling Murphy said Rubio voted "against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe. He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns." Murphy overstates the situation when he says Rubio voted against "every" bill that came up after the Orlando massacre. Rubio voted for Republican-sponsored legislation about background checks and adding restrictions to individuals on the terrorist list. Murphy has a point that Rubio voted against a Republican-sponsored, bipartisan measure to ban people on the no-fly list from buying weapons. However, this ad omits that Rubio supported a separate Republican measure that also banned people on the no-fly list from buying guns but required a court hearing before the person was banned from buying a gun. Murphy's statement contains an element of truth but omits important facts to create a misleading picture. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a7895d6b-db52-4212-8f81-a9a54a7976ba	None	Patrick Murphy	None	None	None	2016-09-22T12:09:51	2016-09-15	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Marco_Rubio']

pomt-07962	Says a Portland school gives Muslim students "their own school provided prayer room, prayer rugs," and lets them "out of class five times a day to pray to Allah."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2011/jan/23/victoria-taft/victoria-taft-says-rigler-elementary-gave-prayer-r/	Remember that whole separation of church and state thing? Well, according to a recent blog post by local radio personality Victoria Taft, the wall dividing the two is crumbling over at Portland's Rigler Elementary School. In her missive, Taft writes that "Muslim students at Portland's Rigler Elementary School are given their own school provided prayer room, prayer rugs, helpfully stored in the prayer room by the school, and let out of class five times a day to pray to Allah. Did I mention this is during school hours?" If this sounds a little dubious, she backs it up in the Dec. 27, 2010, post: "School officials AND the PPS spokesman confirmed before I went on the air with this earlier this month." There's a lot more in her post, but she keeps coming back to the idea that Muslim students are getting exceptional treatment. Here's another sentence along those lines: "The school stores the Muslim prayer rugs for the students in a special room and they roll them all out for the kids five times a day." So is any of this true? Well, according to Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby, it's not. In fact, as much as we like to keep up on our talk radio, this whole issue flew under our radar until we received an e-mail from Shelby asking us to debunk the claim. We read over Taft's original post and found it provocative enough to deem it worth a look. One claim that caught our attention straight away: It didn't seem right that Muslim students would be praying five times during the school day. It's true, some Muslims pray five times a day, but most of those prayers don't fall during the school day. Rigler's school day runs from 8 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. The five prayers traditionally take place before dawn, just after noon, midafternoon, at sunset and before bed. Of those five prayers, only one (possibly two) would seem to conflict with the school schedule. With that in mind, we gave Shelby a call. He reiterated some of what he had told us in previous e-mails. He was contacted by Taft's producer, who said the show had received a complaint from a relative of a teacher that Muslim students were being singled out for special treatment. Shelby said he told the producer he would look into it, but, in the end, for no reason in particular, they never actually spoke about the situation. When he saw the blog post, he contacted Rigler and was told nobody there spoke with Taft or a producer for her show. (Taft still maintains a school official confirmed her report, though she declined to give us the name of that official.) So, we asked, how did any of this crop up in the first place? Well, Shelby said, four years ago, two brothers at Rigler asked for permission to pray at lunch during Ramadan, an Islamic holy month. The students were allowed to do so in an empty office. The school, he said, did not convert the office to a prayer room; the two were simply to pray in private. The students prayed just once a day and no rugs were provided. Shelby then pointed us to a couple of memos from Portland Public Schools’ general counsel Jollee Faber Patterson. One of the memos deals with religious instruction in school and makes clear that teachers should neither encourage nor discourage religious expression -- no matter the faith. In another memo, this one dealing specifically with special requests during Ramadan, Patterson suggests that schools "should accommodate reasonable requests." This, she writes, would include giving students access to a quiet place to pray and excusing students from physical education should they be fasting during the day (as is custom during Ramadan). Shelby says Portland Public Schools has made allowances for children of other faiths as well. At one elementary school, Christian students are allowed to miss class in order to participate in religious studies off campus. A few years back, Wilson High School rescheduled a graduation ceremony to accommodate Jewish students who were observing Shabbat. Other schools keep the Sabbath in mind when scheduling Friday night and weekend activities, Shelby said. "It's all over the board, and we try to accommodate our kids as best we can," Shelby said. After talking to Shelby, we tried to get in touch with Taft to see if she stood by her blog post. She referred us only to an updated blog post that went up the night after we asked for comment. In her new post, she says she may have "conflated his (Shelby’s) ‘checking it out’ with the other confirmations but it's not a lie -- intentional or otherwise." She then goes on to dissect a response from Shelby, which reads, in part: "Rigler School does not have any students that pray as part of their school day. This includes, Muslims, Christians, Jews, Mormons and other groups mentioned in the article. Consequently, the school does not have any space or equipment devoted to any type of religious practice at school. Four years ago, Rigler did have two brothers who asked permission to pray during their lunch during Ramadan. The school did give them a quiet space to use; they missed no instructional time to do so and only prayed once a day. Those are the facts." Taft cites this as proof that her original post was accurate. She says, "Shelby confirms that the district has provided a spot at the school to pray." It's true, he does. But Taft’s original post went much further than that. She said that the students were praying five times a day (instead of once), that the school let them out of class (it was during lunch), that the school gave them a prayer room (it was an unused office) and prayer rugs (nope), and that other religions would not be similarly accommodated (they are). We tried to get in touch with Taft one last time to let her address these loose ends. She declined. "I'll just leave my comments as is," she wrote in an e-mail. Well, given that, we find the claim to be not only false but ridiculous: Pants on Fire. Return to OregonLive to comment on Victoria Taft's statement and this Politifact Oregon ruling.

pomt-08331	"Before we even passed health care, 4 millions kids got health insurance that didn't have it before, through the Children's Health Insurance Program."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/28/barack-obama/obama-said-he-got-health-care-insurance-4-million-/	President Barack Obama went on comedian Jon Stewart's "The Daily Show" on Oct. 27, 2010, to make his case to younger voters. Stewart was a tough questioner of the president, saying that despite a campaign that promised audacious change, "legislatively, it has felt timid at times." Obama said he disagreed with that, adding, "We've done things that some folks don't even know about." "What have you done that we don't know about? Are you planning a surprise party for us? Filled with jobs and health care?" Stewart asked. Obama then listed a string of accomplishments, including this one: "Before we even passed health care, 4 millions kids got health insurance that didn't have it before, through the Children's Health Insurance Program." You might not remember it, but an expansion to the state Children's Health Insurance Program became law very early in Obama's presidency. The program provides insurance to children in families who aren't poor enough to qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. President George W. Bush had vetoed the legislation twice in 2007, on the grounds that it increased tobacco taxes and would expand government-run health insurance programs to the middle class. Obama signed the law on Feb. 9, 2009. Now, what about the 4 million kids? Was it really that many? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculated in 2007 that the law would expand eligibility to 3.8 million children but that would be after the new law had been in place four years. Obama's bill has been in place just under two years, so it likely hasn't increased by that much. Because the program is administered by the states, the most recently available national enrollment figures on the program are from June 2009. They show, as we would expect, only a modest increase in the program's enrollment. In ruling on our statement, Obama is correct to claim credit for signing the Children's Health Insurance Program into law after Bush had vetoed it. But he was exaggerating by using the 4 million estimate prematurely. It will take awhile for the program to reach its projected enrollment. So we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-03545	"Half of all hospitalized seniors are suffering from malnutrition so severe that it either caused their illness or it prevents them from getting better."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/26/meals-wheels-rhode-island/meals-wheels-rhode-island-says-half-hospitalized-s/	In Rhode Island and around the country, Meals on Wheels gets food to elderly people who cannot get it for themselves. The elderly, especially those on a constricted budget or unable to get to a store or a pantry, are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. A recent fundraising letter sent out by Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island included this statement making note of the problem: "In fact, half of all hospitalized seniors are suffering from malnutrition so severe that it either caused their illness or it prevents them from getting better." A reader who received the letter wondered about that claim and forwarded it to us, asking: "Is this true? If yes, it is an appalling statistic." We found the statistic disturbing as well, and decided to check it out. First, we contacted Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island. Its executive director, Heather Amaral, said the letter was written by an outside firm. Amaral checked with the firm and got back to PolitiFact, providing us links to several sources. One was an undated article in the Journal of Nursing -- published post 2010 -- that said "malnutrition is becoming increasingly more common among the elderly population" and "about 60 percent of hospitalized older adults (age 65 or older) … are experiencing malnutrition." It cited as its source a 2006 article in the Journal of Gerontological Nursing. The Journal of Nursing article also stated that "malnutrition impacts morbidity, mortality, hospital length of stay, functional disabilities, and physical complications. Malnutrition can cause increased infection, electrolyte imbalances, altered skin integrity, anemia, weakness, and fatigue." Another source provided by Meals on Wheels was an online information sheet by the National Resource on Nutrition, Physical Activity and Aging, called "Malnutrition and Older Americans," which, according to the online sheet, was based at Florida International University in Miami. It said that "as many as 65 percent of the elders in hospitals may be malnourished." The sheet said "studies have shown that older adults at nutritional risk tend to make more visits to physicians, hospitals and emergency rooms," have hospital stays twice as long as well-nourished patients and are re-admitted more frequently. The website, which was partially supported by a grant from the federal Administration on Aging, did not give a source for its information. And phone numbers listed for the organization no longer work. A call to the university in Florida found that it no longer has the National Resource on Nutrition, Physical Activity and Aging. A third source was a July 1995 New York Times article that said "one half of elderly hospital patients are malnourished," though the article did not list a source for the figure and did not address whether malnutrition caused their sickness or kept them from recovering. None of the sources supported the key part of Meals on Wheels’ claim that half of hospitalized seniors have such severe malnutrition that it either caused their illness or prevented them from getting better. Those strong assertions go well beyond the information Meals on Wheels provided. On our own, we found several studies and medical journal articles about malnutrition in hospitalized elderly people. They showed malnutrition is more common in that age group, but they offered varying estimates for the extent of the problem. Ellen Furman, an assistant professor of nursing at American International College, in Springfield, Mass., pointed us to what she said was some of the most current literature on the subject -- a 2010 article in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. That study used a pool of about 4,500 people, with a mean age of 82 years old. It found that about 40 percent were malnourished. "What is so frustrating when trying to quote prevalence rates for undernutrition in hospitalized older adults is that every study has different rates dependent upon setting and population samples," Furman said by e-mail. We also contacted experts who worked on a "consensus statement" about adult malnutrition, published in 2012 by a joint research group for two national nutrition organizations. The statement said there is a wide range of estimates of malnutrition among adults. We reached out to Rhode Island Hospital and Lifespan, the state’s biggest hospital group (which includes Rhode Island Hospital.) Spokeswomen for both said they couldn’t confirm the 50-percent rate cited by Meals on Wheels. But they said nutritionists for the hospitals agreed that malnutrition leaves patients vulnerable to other illnesses. We also contacted state and federal agencies that deal with health care and the elderly but none had firm statistics on the extent or severity of malnutrition in the hospitalized elderly. Our ruling Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island, in a fundraising letter, said: "In fact, half of all hospitalized seniors are suffering from malnutrition so severe that it either caused their illness or it prevents them from getting better." To determine a ruling, we broke the statement into three parts. First, are half of all hospitalized seniors suffering from malnutrition? We found papers and studies that included malnutrition rates among hospitalized elderly of about 40 percent to 60 percent, either at admission to the hospital or during their stays, in the range that Meals on Wheels cited. (Other studies and papers, many of them conducted in Europe, gave a wider percentage range). Second, is the malnutrition so severe it caused their illness? We found nothing to support this. Third, is their malnutrition so severe it prevents them from getting better? We found research showing that malnutrition can make someone susceptible to other illnesses and contribute to longer hospitalization. But we found nothing to support the claim that the malnutrition prevented them from recovering. Malnutrition among the elderly is clearly a serious problem. But this statement goes beyond what the evidence shows. The judges rule it Mostly False.	None	Meals on Wheels of Rhode Island	None	None	None	2013-05-26T00:01:00	2013-04-18	['None']
pomt-11337	"When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-china-slaps-25-percent-tariff-a/	President Donald Trump took to Twitter to bemoan what he considers unfair practices in the United States’ automobile trade with China. "When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%," Trump tweeted April 9. "Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s figures match up with international trade data. But economists raised some important details that Trump omitted from his tweet, which put his claim in a slightly different light. Trump’s numbers are correct Trump’s numbers are drawn from American and Chinese government trade data. The United States does, in fact, pay a 25 percent tariff on cars sent to China, whereas China pays only 2.5 percent on cars coming into the United States So the numerical portion of Trump’s claim is correct. But experts said his statement leaves out context. China makes up a relatively small share of U.S. auto imports For starters, China exports very few cars to the United States. China accounted for about 3 out of every 10,000 cars sold in the United States last year, according to Michael Hicks, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University. "For every car we import from China, we export six to China. None of those Chinese-produced cars is branded by a Chinese company (it is mostly Volvo)," Hicks said. "Our auto industry is doing extraordinarily well in China, while Chinese car production limps along." To illustrate China’s relatively low share of car exports to the United States, Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, pointed out data on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States, Mexico and Canada impose no tariffs. Here’s a side-by-side look at China, and the United States’ NAFTA trade partners: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "China exports very few cars to the U.S. So Trump’s Tweet is once again a bit of a red herring," said Bown, who noted that a similar disparity exists when comparing Chinese car exports to the European Union, Japan or South Korea. Cherry-picking? Some experts suggested Trump had cherry-picked the facts by singling out "cars" instead of a broader category of automobiles or car parts. For instance, the U.S. tariff on light trucks from China is 25 percent. That import duty is a legacy tariff that dates back to a trade dispute in the 1960s between the United States and several European countries, according to Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. "So by choosing ‘cars" but not ‘trucks’ in his Twitter example, Trump is cherry-picking products and not telling the entire story," said Bown, of the Peterson Institute. Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute, noted that Chinese tariffs on American auto parts sent to China are well below 25 percent. For example, China places a 10 percent tariff on automobile engines. That’s significant because "U.S. firms often ship auto parts to China to be assembled there," Hufbauer added. Hicks, of Ball State University, noted that the trade disparity stems in part from Trump’s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era deal to lower trade barriers among a dozen countries. "So, had he not killed the TPP, whatever tariff distortions which now exist would have been reduced," Hicks said. Our ruling Trump said, "When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%." American and Chinese government trade data support the numbers in Trump’s statement. However, Trump’s tweet ignored that China makes up a relatively small share of U.S. auto imports overall, and he didn’t tell the whole story by singling out cars rather than a broader category of related imports. One expert said Trump’s own trade policies have contributed to the disparity in car import tariffs. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-12213	During the Nixon Watergate investigation, "out of courtesy, the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice. But there was nothing official."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/21/donald-trump/trump-watergate-fbi-reported-doj-courtesy/	President Donald Trump talked about how the FBI handled its findings as it investigated the Watergate break-in and its ties to the Nixon White House in a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times. Here’s the transcript from that moment in the conversation with three reporters: "When Nixon came along (inaudible) was pretty brutal, and out of courtesy, the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice. But there was nothing official, there was nothing from Congress. There was nothing — anything. But the FBI person really reports directly to the president of the United States, which is interesting." Watergate began when a team from the re-election campaign of President Richard Nixon broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, photographed documents and bugged the phones. Police caught several team members at about 2:30 a.m. June 17, 1972, and an FBI investigation began that same night. The break-in, the cover-up and efforts by the White House to obstruct the work of the FBI led to multiple convictions and Nixon’s resignation in August 1974. In Trump’s view, as the investigation moved forward, the FBI kept the Justice Department informed as a courtesy. Trump’s statement runs into some problems with history. Cleveland attorney James Robenalt, who runs a course on the lessons of Watergate, said there is no basis for Trump’s claim. "The director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General, and it was not a matter of ‘courtesy during Watergate’ to report to the Department of Justice, rather standard operating procedure," he said. "For verification look at the organization chart of the Department of Justice." The full chart clearly shows that the FBI answers to the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Benjamin Wittes, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and the editor of Lawfare, a respected legal affairs blog, said there was a thread of accuracy behind his statement. Watergate, Wittes said, was a turning point. Trump might have been thinking of what existed up to that time. "There are a whole series of norms that developed in the post-Watergate era that the president stay out of investigative matters and that we expect the FBI director to stay out of political matters," Wittes said. Certainly, the history of the FBI under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover is chock full of instances where the FBI dealt directly with the White House. That took place even over the express orders of a series of Attorneys General, including Robert F. Kennedy. Wittes also said that the president has the power to hire and fire the FBI director and, in that sense, the director ultimately is answerable to the president. But Trump made the broad assertion that there was "nothing official" that compelled the FBI to report to the Justice Department. We raised this issue with the White House press office and did not get an answer. We found that the historic record runs counter to Trump’s words. The founding of the FBI The annual reports of the Justice Department from 1907 to 1910 spell out in no uncertain terms that the FBI (known simply as the Bureau of Investigation back then) was created precisely in order to report to the Justice Department. Attorney General Charles Bonaparte (a great-nephew of the French emperor) under President Theodore Roosevelt first made the case for an investigative division in his 1907 report to Congress. "A Department of Justice with no force of permanent police in any form under its control is assuredly not fully equipped for its work," he said." Bonaparte created the bureau in 1908, as his successor noted in his report in 1909. "A few days before July 1, 1908, under the direction of my predecessor, the first active steps were taken toward the organization in this department of a comprehensive investigation service for the purpose of collecting evidence for the use of the government in cases pending or about to be commenced in the federal courts, and also for making such other examinations and investigations as the business of the department might require." The 1910 annual report noted that the Attorney General is "kept constantly informed of the progress of all investigations." J. Edgar Hoover, according to several historians, accepted the job in 1924 only on the understanding that "the Bureau will be responsible only to the Attorney General." Even if Hoover didn’t follow that principle, the annual reports to Congress establish that the FBI was created by and for the Justice Department. From the very beginning, it reported to the department, and that practice didn’t start during Watergate. In 1974, the Justice Department conducted its own review of the FBI’s actions in Watergate. It concluded that the agency "followed well established departmental policies" and "all information developed indicating any possible violations of federal law was properly referred to the department." In fact, in direct contradiction to Trump’s understanding, it faulted the FBI for sharing reports with Nixon’s White House counsel, calling it "probably the most serious blunder from an investigative standpoint." "FBI reports should be disseminated only to the prosecutor and certainly never to the White House," the report said. Our ruling Trump said "out of courtesy, the FBI started reporting to the Department of Justice" in the course of the Watergate investigation, and that there was "nothing official." Justice Department annual reports dating from the birth of the FBI and the organizational structure of the Justice Department show that Trump is wrong. During Watergate, the FBI reported to the Attorney General’s Office because that is what it was created to do. It was not a matter of courtesy. Trump’s ability to hire and fire the FBI director gives him ultimate authority over the conduct of the FBI director, but that's separate from the reporting obligations of the bureau to the Justice Department. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14619	"Today Russia holds many of our most precious national security satellites at risk before they ever get off the ground."	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/jan/29/john-mccain/john-mccain-right-about-american-reliance-russian-/	The United States outsources the process of sending its military satellites into space, and to Russia no less, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said during a hearing on military space launches Jan. 27. "Today Russia holds many of our most precious national security satellites at risk before they ever get off the ground," said McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The context of McCain’s statements comes on the heels of legislation he introduced Thursday to repeal a provision that allows the government to use Russian-made rocket engines to send U.S. military satellites into space. The provision was reversed when Congress passed a $1.1 trillion spending bill, averting a government shutdown, in December. He noted that using the Russian engines, RD-180s, benefits Russian President Vladimir Putin and his "gang of corrupt cronies." NPO Energomash produces the RD-180s. According to Russian Embassy spokesman Yury Melnik, NPO Energomash is managed by RKK Energiya, whose major stockholder is the Russian government. Here are McCain’s full remarks: "In stark contrast to the reviews under way for satellites already in space, the (Defense) Department appears less interested in rapidly addressing our most immediate threat: our reliance on Russian-made rocket engines. Today Russia holds many of our most precious national security satellites at risk before they ever get off the ground. Yet the Department of Defense has actively sought to undermine – with the support of United Launch Alliance (ULA) and the parochial motivations of Sen. (Richard) Shelby, R-Ala., and Sen. (Dick) Durbin, D-Ill. – the direction of this committee to limit that risk and end the use of the Russian made RD-180 by the end of this decade." We wondered whether American satellites really take flight using Russian engines. Cleared for takeoff McCain press aide Julie Tarallo said the United States has relied on Russian engines in recent years, which independent experts confirmed. Richard Bloom is the director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott. He said the United States has used the RD-180s since 2000. The first flight occurred that year, according to Melnik. "He’s certainly correct, the U.S. has been dependent on the Russian Federation," Bloom said. While Bloom noted that "national security" can be defined in a multitude of ways, from 2000 to 2010 he said there were about 29 U.S. space launches using the RD-180. "The Russian Federation has a valuable capability," he said. ULA, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin that started in 2006, has a contract with the Air Force to launch the satellites. They also use the RD-180s on their Atlas V rocket. ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye told PolitiFact/ABC 15 in a prepared statement via email that a new, American engine is "being developed." McCain’s committee supported previous measures to prohibit the use of the engines. With the space race behind us, using Russia’s help in the outer world is nothing new. As we previously reported in a July 2011 fact-check of Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio, NASA has had a contract to pay the Russians to send someone to the International Space Station for more than a decade. While NASA announced in September 2014 that American companies Boeing and SpaceX would work on transporting American astronauts to the Space Station, NASA spokesman Allard Beutel said the agency still has a contract with the Russians from 2018 through June 2020. NASA astronauts have flown on Russian spacecrafts since the 1990s. What’s the risk? That’s a bit harder to define. In 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin threatened to ban the export of Russian rockets to help fuel the U.S. satellite program. That would leave the United States without a way to get many of its satellites into space. However, the Russians never followed through on that threat. Our ruling McCain said, "Today Russia holds many of our most precious national security satellites at risk before they ever get off the ground." That’s correct, though the level to which that represents a risk, as McCain said, is somewhat unknown. Russia did at one point threaten to stop exporting the Russian-made engines fueling the U.S. satellite program. But it didn’t follow through. The U.S. government’s goal is to eventually end this dependence on Russian-made engines, but, for now, that is not the case. McCain’s statement is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-07779	When it comes to urgency on passing a budget repair bill, "there’s no rush on this thing" because the fiscal year doesn’t end until June 30, 2011.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/22/jon-erpenbach/wisconsin-state-sen-jon-erpenbach-claims-there-no-/	Hanging over the standoff on union rights in Wisconsin is the question: How long will Democratic state senators continue their out-of-state boycott in an effort to delay a vote and get a compromise with Republican Gov. Scott Walker? The 14 Democrats are holed up in Illinois to avoid being forced to return to Madison for a vote. Their absence means the Senate lacks a quorum to vote on spending measures. And that means a delay on Walker’s plan to solve a $137 million budget shortfall – in part by forcing most public employees to pay more for their pensions and health care. It also would sharply curtail collective bargaining rights. That budget year ends June 30, 2011. The next two-year budget, which begins July 1, 2011, has a much larger projected deficit, one that tops $3 billion. So, how long will the Democrats stay away? State Sen. Jon Erpenbach answered that question Feb. 17, 2011, as a guest on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show. Erpenbach, a Democrat from Middleton near Madison, suggested there was no quick timetable, noting June 30 is the key date. "This budget doesn’t need to pass right now," Erpenbach told Maddow. "And keep in mind it’s not the big budget, it’s just a minor budget repair bill that’s totally porked up with all sorts of things that Gov. Walker wants – it’s a huge power grab. There’s no rush on this thing. We have time to deliberate, we have time to debate, we have time to change it, we have time to make it better." So, amid all the talk of a state budget "crisis," is it true there is not much urgent about it? We asked Erpenbach to explain. He said his point was there is no urgency on the portion of Walker’s repair bill that severely limits collective bargaining – because that policy move has no fiscal impact on the state budget. Walker could drop his demand on collective bargaining and the repair bill still would be fully funded, Erpenbach contended. However, in making the statement, Erpenbach made no such distinction. Rather, he spoke of the budget repair bill as a whole. Let’s take a look. The non-partisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau analyzed Walker’s repair bill funding plan. The main source of funds is a debt-restructuring plan that saves money in the short term by pushing principal payments into the future. The other, much smaller, source is the $30 million from a plan to impose the higher health care and pension co-payments on state employees. That piece represents about 22 percent of the overall shortfall. The fiscal bureau paper notes the Walker plan to eliminate collective bargaining rights for public employees over fringe benefits and working conditions, and limit wage negotiations, would have no fiscal impact in the current budget year. So Erpenbach is correct the math of Walker’s budget repair bill does not hinge on the controversial union rights provision. However, as we noted in a previous item, the short-term deficit is real. And it is based on some pending shortfalls in key programs, and that clearly adds urgency to the proceedings. Debt restructuring: The Walker administration says the debt-restructuring plan must be approved within days – by Feb. 25 or 26, 2011 – to make sense financially. Fiscal Bureau Director Robert Lang is trying to confirm that, but Erpenbach and other Democratic staff members we talked to said they did not dispute it. Medicaid funding: There’s also a projected $153 million shortfall in state Medicaid-funded programs for the needy. The state could run out of cash as soon as April 1 to keep Medicaid funds flowing, Lang told us. Walker said some Medicaid providers might not get reimbursed if the money isn’t there. Meanwhile, the changes to force more in health and pension payments from state employees also have a ticking clock. According to Lang, the savings figure will start to drop if those cuts can’t be put in place by March 13 payrolls. Walker said the deadline was April 1 if the full $30 million in savings was to be realized. So far, Democrats have not offered their own plan for closing the deficit, though they have signaled a willingness to accept the higher employee contributions for pensions and health care. So they cannot argue that the deadlines on debt restructuring and employee givebacks are not in play. Erpenbach argued that Walker could simply rescind the $140 million in business tax breaks the Legislature approved earlier in 2011 at his urging. That, he said, could be used to finance the budget repair bill. But as we noted in a recent item, those tax cuts don’t kick in until the next two-year budget. So they have no impact on the immediate shortfall. Erpenbach is wrong on that point. There is an interesting historical footnote regarding Erpenbach’s claim about the repair bill moving too fast. In 2009, when Democrats were in charge, Erpenbach was in the party-line majority that approved a budget fix that raised taxes by $290 million. It got exactly one day’s review by the state Senate and no public hearing. Let’s get to the bottom line. In answering a question about when he and other Democrats would return to the Capitol, Erpenbach said there was no sense of urgency surrounding the vote on the budget repair bill. The collective bargaining changes – the most controversial part of the measure – do not have a fiscal impact in this bill. Erpenbach said that’s what he meant, though he did not say it that way. But the entire budget bill – as currently constructed – is not something that can wait as long as summer. A Medicaid shortfall is projected to hit the state by the end of March. The pension and health care contributions lose some of their impact on the budget if not approved within weeks. And the bill is reliant on a debt plan that apparently must be approved within days. The PolitiFact definition of Barely True is "the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That’s our rating of Erpenbach’s statement, Barely True. (Editor's note: After this item was published, Lang clarified his statement to say Medicaid money would run out to April or May. Also, on Feb. 24, 2011, Gov. Scott Walker put the projected date as "mid-May.") Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Jon Erpenbach	None	None	None	2011-02-22T11:12:16	2011-02-17	['None']

pomt-04517	"On Medicare for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/03/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cut-716-billion-medicare/	Medicare figured prominently in the first debate between President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney. The cost of the popular government health care program for seniors is growing rapidly and broadly believed to be unsustainable. Throughout the campaign, the candidates have been accusing each other of endangering the program, or not doing enough to maintain it. Romney raised a charge we’ve heard before, that "on Medicare for current retirees, (Obama) is cutting $716 billion from the program." What Obamacare does The cut Romney spoke of refers to an aspect of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Obamacare does not literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. The spending reductions were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. The overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program’s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. $716 billion In 2011, the CBO determined that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. So it’s timing that’s making the cuts bigger, not changes to Medicare. And the cuts are from future spending, not the program’s current budget. Our ruling Romney said, "on Medicare for current retirees, (Obama) is cutting $716 billion from the program." That amount -- $716 billion -- refers to Obamacare’s reductions in Medicare spending over 10 years, primarily paid to insurers and hospitals. But the statement gives the impression that the law takes money already allocated to Medicare away from current recipients. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-07531	"The only segment in the beer market that is growing is the craft beer segment."	true	/texas/statements/2011/apr/06/mike-villarreal/state-rep-mike-villarreal-says-craft-beer-only-seg/	Plugging legislation that would allow restaurants that brew their own beer to sell their bottled suds to a beer distributor, state Rep. Mike Villarreal suggested craft brewers are "the future" of the beer industry. "The only segment in the beer market that is growing is the craft beer segment," the San Antonio Democrat said during a March 22 press conference about House Bill 660, which was left pending in a House committee. Responding to our query, Peter Clark, Villarreal’s legislative director, passed on a March 21 press release from the Colorado-based Brewers Association, a trade association representing craft brewers. The association defines a craft brewer as small (produces less than 6 million barrels a year), independent (less than 25 percent is owned by an alcoholic beverage industry member who isn’t a craft brewer) and traditional (at least 50 percent of its total production volume is malt beer or beer that enhances the flavor with grains such as barley or wheat). According to the release, small and independent craft brewers saw production increase 11 percent and retail sales increase 12 percent in 2010. But total U.S. beer sales were down 2.2 percent in 2009 and 1 percent in 2010. Total beer volume dropped from 205.7 million barrels in 2009 to 203.6 million in 2010, the release says. The National Beer Wholesalers Association, which represents 3,300 licensed independent U.S. beer distributors issued a press release the following day applauding craft brewers’ "continued growth." Harry Schuhmacher, editor of Beer Business Daily, a trade publication focused on the commercial beer industry, told us that Villarreal’s claim is "definitely true." He likewise cited the Brewers Association, which he said tracks craft beer volumes, and the Washington-based Beer Institute, a lobbying group that tracks the entire industry. The Beer Institute pointed us to statistics showing that total estimated domestic beer production decreased 1.6 percent from 2009-10. Craft beer "has really taken on a life of its own in the last four or five years," Schuhmacher said. "And the beer industry itself has always grown" until 2008, when the recession hit, he said. "Ironically, craft beer, which is the highest-priced segment in the beer industry, continued to grow and indeed accelerate." Texas has followed the nationwide trends tracked by the Brewers Association and the Beer Institute, said Rick Donley, president of the Texas Beer Alliance, which supports Villarreal’s bill. "The only thing that has a real growth to it right now is the craft beer segment," he said. The Wholesale Beer Distributors of Texas, which opposes the legislation, didn’t respond to our query. The sales trend in microbrews hasn’t been lost on the big brewers. On March 28, Anheuser-Busch announced plans to buy Chicago craft beermaker Goose Island. "Sales of these more expensive and more sophisticated craft beers are a tiny drop in the bucket compared to mass market beer sales, but they’re growing faster than mainstream beers," according to a National Public radio story about the deal. Last September, CNBC reported that publicly-traded craft beer companies had seen "explosive growth" in the U.S. while overall beer sales were down. And an August MarketWatch report said: "While beer consumption in recent quarters has remained mostly anemic for the major commercial beer brewers... sales for premium or so-called craft beers have continued at a steady pace."

pomt-08529	Says Will Rasmussen supported a sales tax as recently as last spring.	false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/05/promote-oregon-leadership-pac-oregon-house-republi/house-republicans-accuse-will-rasmussen-supporting/	In a political tit-for-tat, Oregon House Republicans are going after Will Rasmussen, the Democratic candidate for House District 37, for allegedly supporting a sales tax. This comes after Democrats targeted Julie Parrish, the Republican candidate, for the very same thing. PolitiFact Oregon already looked into the charge levied against Parrish and found it lacking, but now Republicans say Rasmussen was just using those allegations as a way to cover up his own support for a sales tax. "Why are Will Rasmussen and the House Democrats making false claims about Parrish's position on sales taxes?" reads the e-mail from the House Republicans. "Are they trying to mask Rasmussen's support of a sales tax as recently as last spring?" We figured if we fact checked the Democrats’ claim and found it to be a little less than truthful, it might be worth our time to check in on the Republicans, too. The e-mail we received from the Republicans cites comments Rasmussen made on March 15, 2010, at a Washington County Public Affairs Forum as the basis for the attack. Specifically, it highlights a piece of an answer about the state’s initiative petition process. Here’s the way the Republicans framed the remarks: "Rasmussen told the Washington County Public Affairs Forum that Oregon should look ‘at alternative funding sources, certain transactions that may be taxable.’" (That second quote is them quoting Rasmussen.) So, we went back to the video of the forum. The comment came up after an audience member asked what the candidates thought about a proposal to make the monetary impact of ballot initiatives clearer to voters. Rasmussen used the question as an opportunity to talk about the state’s revenue structure. Here’s the bulk of what he said: "Oregon has the 3rd most volatile state revenue of any state in the Union. That's, of course, because we're so reliant on the income tax here in Oregon. And that's the most volatile tax. We have high highs and low lows. And what this does is create with mathematical certainty a funding crisis when the economy's bad. And here we find ourselves again six years or eight years after the last recession in a really bad economy and lo and behold we don't have dollars to go around. This is predictable insanity the way we currently have this structure set up. The challenge is how we fix it. There's several ways to go about it. You look at alternative funding sources, certain transactions that may be taxable, a lot of folks want to look at a rainy day fund, and I think that makes a lot sense. That would help flatten out the highs and the lows of our revenue structure." House Republicans were upfront with the comments leading up to the talk about taxable transactions, but they left out Rasmussen’s more-vocal support for a larger rainy day fund. That little bit goes a long way, we think, because Rasmussen clearly endorses that idea. "I think that makes a lot sense," he says of the rainy day fund. With the bit about transactions, though, he seems to simply be naming one alternative that has popped up over the years: "You look at alternative funding sources, certain transactions that may be taxable." There, his tone appears to be more matter-of-fact. It seems clear to us that he supports the rainy day fund, but he doesn’t offer the same vocal support to a possible sales tax. PolitiFact Oregon talked to Rasmussen to see if he could explain his remarks.

pomt-02873	"In the last four years, our economy has grown on average 0.9 percent a year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/13/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-us-has-averaged-09-percent-growth-ov/	He may have served in the Senate for less than a year, but Sen. Ted Cruz. R-Texas, has already made enough waves to secure a guest appearance on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. During the interview, Cruz took aim at the nation’s low rates of economic growth in recent years. "You know," Cruz said, "in the last four years, our economy has grown on average 0.9 percent a year. It’s not working." We knew that in recent years, economic growth has been weaker than usual. But has it really been as low as Cruz said? Economic growth is measured by the change in gross domestic product (GDP) -- the sum of all economic activity for a nation -- over a given period of time. The two most common time periods for measuring GDP growth are over the course of one year and over the course of one quarter. (Quarterly growth measurements are typically multiplied by four so they can show how fast the economy would have grown if that expansion had continued all year long.) We turned to the official data for the nation’s gross domestic product, which is compiled by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Whether Cruz is correct depends -- heavily -- on what time frame is used. One method uses data from the four most recent calendar years for which full-year data is available -- the full-year figures for 2008 through 2012. The percentage change in inflation-adjusted GDP was -2.8 percentage points in 2009, +2.5 points in 2010, +1.8 points in 2011, and +2.8 points in 2012. If you average these, it works out to a 1.1 percentage-point increase per year. Cruz is fairly close, but he’s still understating growth by more than one-fifth. Moreover, we have access to more current data. We now have quarterly data taking us through the first three-quarters of 2013. Measuring from the third quarter of 2009 through the third quarter of 2013 actually hews more closely to Cruz’s words -- "in the last four years." Calculating it this way, inflation-adjusted GDP increased, on average, 2.3 percent per year over the last four years -- almost two and a half times as fast as what Cruz indicated. When we checked with Cruz’s office, a spokeswoman explained that the figures they used "are calculated using annual data, which is the most accurate way to compare growth year to year. The updated info you refer to is quarterly data, which is a small snapshot in time and doesn't reflect an accurate picture when compared to annual data from a previous year." Several economists we checked with, however, disagreed, saying the difference between using annual figures and quarterly figures would be minimal, limited only to possible changes in the final quarter as soon as the current number, which is preliminary, is adjusted to account for late data. The economists we asked said that any change from using an adjusted figure for one quarter would be small, drowned out by data from the other 15 quarters used in the calculation. A much bigger factor is the time frame used. To use annual figures means that the calculation includes the disastrous first half of 2009, when the recession was still under way. By contrast, using the quarterly data replaces those three weak quarters of 2009 with three quarters of modest but positive economic growth from 2013. Given the stark differences between the two methods, there’s a temptation to choose the method that bolsters your own preferences. However, the experts said that, given these two choices, the most appropriate way to calculate data for "the last four years" would be to use data that’s current, not nine months old. And this data shows growth of 2.3 percent. The one implication of Cruz’s comment that seems solid is that even 2.3 percent growth is low by historical standards, which has been a little more than 3 percent. Our ruling Cruz said that "in the last four years, our economy has grown on average 0.9 percent a year." Cruz has a point that economic growth has been below historical standards in recent years, but his estimates are low compared to both the calculations we did -- slightly low in one case, significantly lower in the other. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2013-11-13T12:18:29	2013-11-08	['None']
pomt-08812	"More than three-quarters of the oil is gone."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/16/carol-browner/carol-browner-says-three-quarters-oil-spilled-gulf/	With the oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico finally stemmed, Carol Browner, special adviser to the president for energy and climate change, delivered what she said was some more good news: that a government report showed the vast majority of the oil spilled in the gulf is "gone." Browner delivered the news in several forums, but we decided to check her claim on NBC's Today Show on Aug. 4, 2010, when she said, "I think it's also important to note that our scientists have done an initial assessment, and more than three-quarters of the oil is gone. The vast majority of the oil is gone." The pronouncement drew immediate and sharp criticism from a number of environmental scientists who said Browner's claim presented too rosy a picture and was based on a good bit of scientific speculation rather than hard fact. We decided to investigate. Browner's claim comes from the newly released "BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Budget Calculator," which seeks to track what has become of the oil released from the well. The report is based on "measurements and best estimates" from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of the Interior, of the 4.9 million barrels of oil estimated to have spilled from the well. According to the report, about 25 percent of the oil is estimated to have been skimmed, burned or directly recovered from the wellhead. Another 25 percent naturally evaporated or dissolved, the report states; about 24 percent was dispersed as microscopic droplets into gulf waters; and the remaining residual, 26 percent, "is either on or just below the surface as light sheen and weather tar balls, has washed ashore or been collected from shore, or is buried in sand and sediments." According to the report, oil in the residual and disbursed categories is in the process of being naturally degraded. In a press release announcing the report, Jane Lubchenco, under-secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator, warned that "less oil on the surface does not mean that there isn't oil still in the water column or that our beaches and marshes aren’t still at risk." Browner's assessment that three-quarters of the oil spilled from the well is "gone" was derided by gulf fishermen, as well as a number of environmental scientists. In an Aug. 5, 2010, Washington Post story, "Scientists question report of shrinking spill," David A. Fahrenthold reported that in interviews with scientists who worked on the report, some said the figures "were based in large part on assumptions and estimates with a significant margin of error." In addition, the story stated, "some outside scientists went further: In a situation in which many facts remain murky, they said, the government seemed to have used interpretations that made the gulf -- and the federal efforts to save it -- look as good as possible." "I think the statement is a 'glass half full' interpretation of the estimates presented in the report," stated Michael J. Blum, a professor in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Tulane University, in an e-mail interview with PolitiFact. "The estimates can also be interpreted as indicating that 50 to 75 percent of the oil remains in the environment." The estimates presented in the report are "a good starting point to work from," said Blum, but "they will undoubtedly be refined pending further work to account for the distribution of oil/dispersants in the gulf." In order to get to the 75 percent figure cited by Browner, the report does a misleading trick, said Ian MacDonald, a professor of biological oceanography at Florida State University. It includes the 17 percent of oil that was captured from the wellhead by pipes and pumped directly onto waiting tankers. "No one cares about oil that wasn't released," MacDonald said. "If I had a student hand in that report, that would not be an acceptable way to present the data." MacDonald further noted that government officials only have firm data on the oil that has been skimmed, burned or chemically dispersed. Most of the rest of the estimates are based on applying formulas from prior gulf spills, most of which occurred near the surface, not in 5,000 feet of water. "All the rest of the numbers come from scientific estimates," MacDonald said, and as a result are "complete theoretical conjecture." "To present such a bunch of speculation as actual scientific fact doesn't strike me as the actions of a responsible regulatory agency," he said. "I don't know that it's necessarily inaccurate, but to say as a scientific fact that it's gone from the system, that it has biodegraded -- with no measurement by NOAA -- I'm sorry, that's baloney." And oil that has been "dispersed" isn't the same as "gone," he said. While some of it will naturally evaporate in the gulf, he said, "the rest of it is still in the water." Ed Overton, a professor at Louisiana State University who collaborated on the report, said in the Washington Post story that he would not have given out exact figures, as Browner did, because "We don't have the foggiest idea [about how to measure the oil] with that precision." We spoke with Overton, who said he was still relatively comfortable with Browner's assessment. "I don't know if I would have put it at three-quarters," Overton said. "I'd say the vast majority. I'd be comfortable with that." And with the evaporation that has likely taken place in the weeks since the date was collected, he said, "I don’t think, today, there is 25 percent of the oil left in the gulf." Oil is an "environmentally biodegradable component," Overton said, and the Gulf of Mexico is particularly adept at naturally breaking down oil because of the warm water and nutrient and oxygen levels. As a result, he said, most of the oil near the surface is degrading rapidly. The greatest uncertainty, he said, is with oil clouds that have seeped into the deep water of the gulf. "There is a great deal of uncertainty in all of this," Overton said. "This is not a real precise science. I think a lot of the estimates are speculation. But if you hit your finger three times with a hammer, do you have to do it a fourth time to know it's going to hurt? I think it's the same with this. Oil doesn't stay around for a terribly long time. We have to use the data we know from past experiences." We think it was a reach for Browner to definitively state that three-quarters of the oil is "gone." For one, a quarter of the oil was described as dispersed. Much of that may be on its way toward being degraded by natural processes, but we think it's unfair to call that "gone." In addition, the report carries a bit of uncertainty. Much of the estimate was based not on on hard data, but was calculated from formulas based on prior gulf spills that occurred in shallower water. As some scientists told us, Browner's estimate may be accurate, but they can't say for sure. In a progress report issued by Browner on Aug. 16, 2010, she was more cautious in her wording, saying, "the vast majority of the oil that spilled into the Gulf has evaporated, skimmed, burned off, been recovered from the wellhead or dispersed." That's more accurate than saying three quarter of the oil is "gone." We rate that characterization Half True.	None	Carol Browner	None	None	None	2010-08-16T17:44:15	2010-08-04	['None']
pomt-10408	"We have drawn down to presurge levels. Basra, Mosul and now Sadr City are quiet and it's long and it's tough and there will be setbacks."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/02/john-mccain/mccains-off-on-iraq-details/	Immediately following days of allegations from Sen. John McCain and his allies that Sen. Barack Obama is short on knowledge about Iraq, McCain made a pair of questionable claims about the war. They came during his discussion of the troop surge at a town hall-style event in Greensdale, Wis., on May 29, 2008. "I can tell you it is succeeding. I can look you in the eye and tell you it's succeeding," McCain said. "We have drawn down to presurge levels. Basra, Mosul and now Sadr City are quiet." Problem is, the U.S. military has not drawn down to presurge levels, according to the Pentagon. Before the start of the surge last year there were about 132,000 troops in Iraq — now there are about 155,000, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mark Ballesteros said. And what about McCain's characterization of Basra, Mosul and Sadr City? All three are places where Iraqi and American forces have launched offensives of late, with varying degrees of success. Basra is indeed enjoying a period of relative calm two months after some 33,000 members of the Iraqi security forces, backed by smaller contingents from the American and British militaries, launched a push called Operation Charge of the Knights to regain control from militias, according to news accounts and the Web site of Multinational Force-Iraq. Relative peace also has reportedly graced Sadr City, a district of Baghdad, following a cease-fire in mid May between government forces and followers of Muqtada al-Sadr. At the urging of Sadr, thousands of residents flooded the streets a day after McCain made his remarks to protest negotiations between the Iraqi government and U.S. officials to allow U.S. forces to stay in Iraq past the December expiration of the U.N. mandate allowing them in the country. Mosul, however, is not quiet. It's true that an Iraqi army and police campaign against al-Qaida in Iraq there met little resistance when it was launched in early May, according to accounts of news reporters on the ground. But on May 29, earlier on the very day McCain made his remarks, at least two Iraqi commandos were killed and nine other people wounded in a suicide bombing in the city, according to the Pentagon's Web site, as well as news accounts. Other attacks were reported in the area surrounding Mosul that day. McCain foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann characterized McCain's comment about troop levels as a mere "verb tense" mistake — meaning he had spoken in the present instead of the future tense. And he said McCain has no misconceptions about the situation in Mosul. "Clearly there is continuing combat there," Schenemann said. "I don't think he's saying that there's no combat in Mosul." But what else could he have meant by "quiet"? And when it comes to describing events in a war zone, tense is rather important. We find that McCain erred in his assertion about troop levels and in his characterization of conditions in Mosul. He was, however, accurate in describing the situation in Sadr City and Basra. We say his statement is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11981	"California, New York and Massachusetts, they represent about 20 percent of the population, they get close to 36 percent of Obamacare funding. It's just simply inequitable."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/29/ron-johnson/obamacare-funding-given-states-unfairly-says-repea/	Making a new argument for why the Affordable Care Act should be repealed, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson claimed that the health care law doesn’t pass the money around fairly. On Sept. 25, 2017, the Wisconsin Republican said on National Public Radio: Currently, it's really been quite unfair. I know that California, New York and Massachusetts, they represent about 20 percent of the population, they get close to 36 percent of Obamacare funding. It's just simply inequitable. It was a claim Johnson had also made twice on MSNBC and on Milwaukee television. And his three fellow co-sponsors of the latest Republican bill to overhaul Obamacare also made the statement a number of times to national media. So, what about the talking point? The numbers are more or less correct. But there’s one simple reason that explains most of the discrepancy: Those three states -- unlike Wisconsin and some others -- opted to take the additional federal funding offered by Obamacare to states that expanded Medicaid. "When you don’t expand Medicaid, you get fewer of the dollars," said Georgetown University health policy analyst and political scientist Jack Hoadley. "The dollars were sitting there for the taking and it was up to the governors and the state legislatures to come in and say yes. To the extent that they said no, they turned down that opportunity to get an equal share." A little history Democratic President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the part of the law forcing states to expand Medicaid was unconstitutional. That meant it was up to each state whether to expand Medicaid, the state- and federal-funded program that provides health insurance coverage to people with low incomes. In February 2016, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker decided not to accept the additional federal funding provided by Obamacare to expand Medicaid, even though Wisconsin did partially expand the program. (We rated Mostly True Walker’s claim that he "turned down a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare," but because of actions he took, for the first time in Wisconsin's history "everyone living in poverty is covered under Medicaid.") The numbers Johnson’s office told us that California, New York and Massachusetts getting nearly 36 percent of Obamacare funding comes from an analysis by the staff of U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. Cassidy is one of the other co-sponsors of the GOP overhaul of Obamacare that was not brought up for an expected Senate vote because not enough GOP senators supported it. (Hours after the decision not to hold the vote, Johnson vowed not to give up on repealing Obamacare.) Ani Turner, one of the leaders of the nonprofit Altarum health consulting firm, said she calculated the percentage to be 32 percent. And Donna Friedsam, a health policy expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, put the figure at 33 percent. So, numbers-wise, Johnson is in the ballpark. But it’s misleading to claim the disproportionate funding is unfair or inequitable. The funding As Turner told us: "Any government assistance program will fund more to states that have greater need, and will likely not simply follow the population share. Factors that would impact the proportion each state receives include whether the state chose to expand Medicaid and the share of people eligible for Medicaid or subsidies." Turner and other experts pointed out that California, New York and Massachusetts were among states that opted to expand Medicaid. "Other large states like Florida and Texas elected not to expand and thus left millions of federal dollars on the table," said Diane Rowland, executive vice president of the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. Rowland also noted that states such as New York and Massachusetts have higher health care costs, which means higher costs for people in Medicaid and thus more funding for those states. In short, Johnson and others praised states that did not take the extra money, but now argue that the states that did take the funding have too much. In any case, states had the option of whether to take the additional funding. Our rating Johnson says: "California, New York and Massachusetts, they represent about 20 percent of the population, they get close to 36 percent of Obamacare funding. It's just simply inequitable." He’s more or less correct on the numbers. But the main reason is that those three were among states that -- unlike Wisconsin and some others -- opted through Obamacare to expand Medicaid and take the additional federal funding that came with it. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-11862	Says diversity visa immigrants are not vetted.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/02/sarah-huckabee-sanders/white-house-press-secretary-claims-diversity-visa-/	White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that immigrants coming to the United States through the diversity visa program are not vetted before their arrival. Her remarks came a day after a terrorist attack in New York City left eight people dead and about a dozen injured. President Donald Trump said the suspect came to the country via the diversity visa program, which allows up to 50,000 people a year from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Program participants are selected through a random, computer-generated lottery. "One of the best things that we have in this country is the fact that everybody wants to be here, and to give that away randomly, to have no vetting system, to have no way to determine who comes, why they are here and if they want to contribute to society is a problem," Sanders said in a Nov. 1 press briefing. Sanders said that "to try to argue that this is a system that thoroughly vets people shows a total lack of understanding" of the process. There have been concerns expressed over the years whether the government’s system of vetting is enough. Yet despite Sanders’ suggestion of no vetting, we found that diversity visa applicants must undergo background checks, security screenings and interviews before coming to the United States. Diversity visa program and application vetting The State Department administers the diversity immigrant visa program, created through a bill signed into law by former President George H. W. Bush in November 1990. An annual random lottery system, which began in 1995, selects applicants from countries that had low levels of immigration in the previous five years. Millions of people apply each year, but only up to 50,000 are granted visas annually. Entries chosen in the lottery do not automatically get a visa, they only become eligible to apply and must meet "simple but strict eligibility requirements," according to the State Department. Information reviewed includes passport, police and medical records, photographs, English translations of documents, and education or work experience credentials. The diversity visa program isn’t known to be a common U.S. entry tool for terrorists, but there’s been at least one other terrorism-related arrest of someone who came through the program. Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, an Uzbekistan citizen entered on a green card through the diversity lottery, according to the libertarian Cato Institute. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to the terrorist organization ISIS. (He had talked of carrying out violence, though no attack actually occurred.) He was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Oct. 27. Earlier, in 2004, Anne Patterson, then the State Department’s Deputy Inspector General, raised concerns about people from countries deemed state sponsors of terrorism. Such individuals couldn’t receive tourist visas, for example, yet they were still eligible for the visa diversity lottery. In congressional testimony, she noted the many ways that diversity visa applicants are screened. "Consular officers interview all diversity visa winners and check police and medical records once applicants begin the actual visa application process," Patterson said. Opponents of the program point to difficulties in performing reviews in many of the countries that qualify for the lottery, noted a 2011 Congressional Research Service report. A 2007 U.S. Government Accountability Office study said it "found no documented evidence" that diversity visa immigrants from state sponsors of terrorism or other countries posed terrorist or any other threat. But it said that some consular officers in Turkey, where some applications from Iranians were adjudicated, reported it "was somewhat difficult to verify Iranian identity documents." The vast majority of Iranian applicants were subject to security advisory opinions (requiring additional in-depth review by multiple federal agencies), but the regional security officer in Ankara "considered it possible for Iranian intelligence officers to pose as (diversity visa) applicants and not be detected by the post’s security screening if their identity was not already known to U.S. intelligence," because the United States does not have a diplomatic presence in Iran, the study said. Even though there are concerns about the program, vetting does exist. "It’s not like you win the lottery and walk into the United States. You are subject to the same vetting procedures," said Anna O. Law, Herbert Kurz chair of Constitutional Rights at CUNY Brooklyn College, who spoke with us for a previous story on the visa program. Our ruling Sanders said diversity visa immigrants are not vetted. There are concerns about potential vulnerabilities related to the admission of diversity visa immigrants, and there are difficulties in verifying documents of individuals from certain countries. But vetting mechanisms exist, including additional in-depth review of applicants who need additional scrutiny. Not all who are awarded the lottery end up getting a visa, but individuals who do make it to the visa application process must undergo background checks and security screenings.

pomt-13593	"Most Americans support" the legalization of marijuana.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/17/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-correct-most-americans-support-legali/	In a Medium post touting his Libertarian presidential candidacy, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson addressed a variety of policies in his platform, including fiscally conservative policies, criminal justice reform and caution before committing troops overseas. He also returned to what has become one of his signature issues: the legalization of marijuana. "In 1999, I became the only sitting governor to publicly advocate the legalization of marijuana," he wrote. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who ran for president in 2016, "came to that viewpoint — a position that most Americans support — 16 years later." We wondered: Is Johnson correct that "most Americans support" the "legalization of marijuana"? We took a look at the recent polling and found that Johnson is basically on target. It wasn’t always the case: As recently as 2005, public opinion was roughly 2-to-1 against marijuana legalization. But we found 14 polls since the beginning of 2014 that show consistent support for legalization. (The poll questions used the broad term "legalization" without providing specifics about how the drug would be sold or whether there would be restrictions on how it could be used.) Here’s a full list of those 14 polls since the start of 2014, drawn from the public opinion archive PollingReport.com: In 12 of these 14 polls, an outright majority of respondents -- 50 percent or more -- supported legalization. As for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent. Overall, if you average the 14 polls, legalization led by a 53 percent-44 percent margin. Joe Hunter, the communications director for Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, said the "most reliable data, when available, is derived from asking the same question over time, with the same methodology. Of the major polling organizations, Gallup is the one who has done that." During the time frame we looked at, Gallup asked the question twice, once finding an 18-point edge for legalization and the other time finding a four-point margin. The most recent Gallup poll before that, taken in 2013, found a 19-point lead for legalization. Our ruling Johnson said that "most Americans support" the "legalization of marijuana." All the polling since the start of 2014 -- 14 polls in all -- shows that legalization leads the status quo. Twelve of those 14 polls showed an absolute majority level of support.

pomt-02435	Crimea was part of Russia "until 1954, when it was given to the Soviet Republic of the Ukraine."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/02/mike-rogers/why-crimea-matters-russia/	President Barack Obama has been vocal in his opposition to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s military intervention in Ukraine. Focus has shifted from the new government in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, to Crimea, a region Russian troops seized control of Saturday. Meanwhile, politicians and pundits are divided over what the United States’ role should be in the conflict. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., expressed his concern of Russia’s interference in Crimea to Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. "I would believe that Russians would love to see the Crimea as part of the Russian Federation," he said. "It was there until 1954 when it was given to the Soviet Republic of the Ukraine at the time. I think they’d like it back. It’s strategic for them militarily and economically." Rogers was correct in saying that Ukraine has only controlled the Crimean Peninsula since 1954 -- a claim we also heard Sunday from the Washington Post's David Ignatius. Not up on your Soviet history? We’ll review the facts. Crimea is an eastern Ukrainian peninsula located on the Black Sea. It’s connected to the rest of the country by a small strip of land. Out of its 2 million residents, about 60 percent consider themselves Russian. That’s the highest concentration of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Although the territory belongs to Ukraine, Russia stations part of its Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol as part of a pre-existing agreement between the two countries. As Rogers pointed out, Crimea hasn’t always been part of Ukraine. Here’s a quick rundown of what’s happened in the region since the Ottoman Empire used the peninsula as a hub for slave trade. 1783: Russia annexed Crimea. 1853: The Crimean War began, lasting three years. Russia lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. Crimea remained part of Russia. 1917: Crimea briefly became a sovereign state before becoming a base for the White Army of anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian War. 1921: The peninsula, now called the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, became part of the Soviet Union. 1942: Nazi Germany took control of Crimea. 1944: Joesph Stalin forcibly deported all Muslim Tatars, a group of 300,000 who had lived on the peninsula for centuries, due to members’ alleged cooperation with Germany during World War II. Many returned to Crimea in the 1980s and 1990s. 1945: After World War II, the autonomous Soviet republic was dissolved and Crimea became a province of the Soviet Union called the Crimean Oblast. 1954: Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimean Oblast to Ukraine. It’s often reported that it was a gesture of goodwill from Khrushchev, who had Ukrainian roots. 1991: The Soviet Union collapsed. Many expected President Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation, to take Crimea for Russia. But he didn’t bring it up during negotiations with Ukraine. 1997: Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty that allowed Russia to keep its fleet in Sevastopol. The agreement’s since been extended, so the fleet is set to remain there until at least 2042. So the story of the Crimean Peninsula is long and complicated, to say the least. And as Rogers implied, there could be more news to come as war threatens Eastern Europe. Today, Crimea’s residents are divided on the issue of Russia’s military intervention. Generally speaking, ethnic Russians support Russia’s involvement in the region, while Tatars and Ukrainians express pro-Ukrainian sentiments. Our ruling Rogers said Crimea belonged to Russia until 1954, when Khrushchev gave the land to Ukraine, then a Soviet republic. Rogers’ history lesson explains why Russians remain so intertwined with Crimea and why some Americans are worried that Russians will try to annex the peninsula. We rate Rogers’ statement True. Correction: About 60 percent of people living in Crimea identify themselves as Russian. An earlier version of this story described the statistic differently.

pomt-14723	Says Bernie Sanders "voted for regime change with respect to Libya."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-voted-get-rid-/	Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton got into a tussle over their differing foreign policy visions at the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. Sanders criticized Clinton for being too hawkish in the Middle East. "I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be," he said Dec. 19. "Yes, we could get rid of (former Iraqi leader) Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region. Yes, we could get rid of (former Libyan dictator Muammar) Gaddafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS. Yes, we could get rid of (Syrian dictator Bashar) Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after." Clinton shot back, "With all due respect, senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya. You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gaddafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution." We wondered if Clinton was right -- that Sanders previously wanted the Libyan leader gone, even though he now views Gaddafi’s ousting as a cautionary tale. The vote The U.S. military spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi, who had held power for decades. The uprising -- part of the Arab Spring -- toppled Gaddafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him the following October. Congress never voted to authorize U.S. military action in Libya, so what is Clinton talking about? On March 1, 2011, the Senate approved a resolution "strongly condemning the gross and systematic violations of human rights in Libya." The Senate approved the resolution by unanimous consent, so senators never actually voted on it. But Sanders showed his support by joining in as one of 10 cosponsors. The resolution called for peaceful regime change, saying Gaddafi should "desist from further violence, recognize the Libyan people’s demand for democratic change, resign his position and permit a peaceful transition to democracy." A Senate resolution carries very little weight. It has no legal teeth and is more like a statement expressing the general "sense of Congress," said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. "In effect, all this resolution does is say, ‘Gaddafi is a bad person and should stop,’ " Huder said, noting that this document cannot be interpreted as expression of congressional intent to take specific action to oust Gaddafi. Sanders’ campaign said Clinton was misrepresenting his record because the Senate resolution was nonbinding and not a show of support for U.S. military action. In a March 28, 2011, interview, Sanders described his position toward regime change in Libya. He wanted Gaddafi gone, but not at all costs. "Look, everybody understands Gaddafi is a thug and murderer," Sanders said to Fox News. "We want to see him go, but I think in the midst of two wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan), I'm not quite sure we need a third war, and I hope the president tells us that our troops will be leaving there, that our military action in Libya will be ending very, very shortly." Clinton also said Sanders’ vote signaled support for United Nations action to get rid of Gaddafi. The Senate resolution asked "the United Nations Security Council to take such further action as may be necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attack, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone over Libyan territory." The two related U.N. resolutions -- 1970 and 1973 -- called for drastic measures to pressure Gaddafi to stop his alleged human rights abuses, including establishing a no-fly zone and imposing an asset freeze on members of the regime. Neither resolution explicitly call for regime change, though. But Clinton as secretary of state and leaders from other countries did use the two U.N. resolutions as a platform to take actions that they hoped would pressure Gaddafi to step down and allow a transition to democracy. "While our military mission is focused on saving lives, we must continue to pursue the broader goal of a Libya that belongs not to a dictator, but to the Libyan people," Clinton said at the International Conference on Libya March 29, 2011. Our ruling Clinton said Sanders "voted for regime change with respect to Libya." The reality is a bit more complicated than the sound bite. Sanders supported a non-binding Senate resolution that called on Gaddafi to resign his post in a peaceful, democratic transition of power. While the Senate passed the resolution by unanimous consent -- meaning no one actually voted on it -- Sanders was one of 10 cosponsors. At the time, Sanders told the media he wanted Gaddafi out of power, but it might not be worth it if it required sustained U.S. military involvement. We rate Clinton's statement Mostly True.

pomt-12618	"BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi Was Just Taken From Her Office In Handcuffs"	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/websites-spread-fake-news-nancy-pelosi-was-arreste/	March 2017 was a very newsy month in Washington D.C., chock-full of claims about wiretapping, health care reform and sanctuary cities. What about the "arrest" of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi? On March 10, 2017, internet posts started spreading this fake news story with headlines such as "BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi Was Just Taken From Her Office In Handcuffs." PolitiFact California examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life." Editor's note: Sunday, April 2, is International Fact-checking Day. To mark the day, PolitiFact will conduct a "fact-check-a-thon" on fake news. Here, our editor Angie Drobnic Holan explains the need for an International Fact-checking Day and how you can stand up for facts. In the posts we examined, the same false details emerged about the U.S. Secret Service arresting Pelosi, a Democrat from San Francisco, because she was "wanted for questioning in a possible coup attempt against the president." No credible media sources repeated the story. Also, the fact-checking website Snopes.com, called it out as "False" on March 11, 2017. As is the case with several other claims checked before by PolitiFact, this fake news claim originally came from a website called TheLastLineOfDefense.org. As noted by Snopes.com, the claim then spread to other "unreliable sites." TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t identify the Pelosi story as fake, but its About Us page notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." The site has not responded to PolitiFact. Not locked up Rather than being behind bars, Pelosi has remained active in Washington D.C. and in her district in recent weeks. Here’s a look at what she’s been up to: -- Pelosi spoke at a press conference on March 13, 2017 in Washington D.C. in response to the Congressional Budget Office’s report on the GOP health care proposal -- Pelosi participated in a press conference on March 24, 2017 in Washington D.C. reacting to the GOP’s failed bid to repeal Obamacare -- Pelosi attended a town hall meeting with constituents in San Francisco on March 25, 2017 -- Pelosi called for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-California, to recuse himself from the panel’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election In the end, the claim that Pelosi was "just taken from her office in handcuffs" is "total baloney," to use a phrase from TheLastLineOfDefense.org.

pomt-04392	Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown shows someone can be bipartisan in Congress because he "votes about 66 percent with his own party."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/18/brendan-doherty/rhode-island-republican-brendan-doherty-says-he-ca/	During the Oct. 16, 2012, debatebetween U.S. Rep. David Cicilline and challenger Brendan Doherty, Democrat Cicilline said his Republican opponent shouldn't be elected because it would let the GOP keep control of the House and push policies that Rhode Islanders don't want. But Doherty argued, as he repeatedly has, that he would be his own man and not tied to the party the way Cicilline almost always votes with his fellow Democrats. To illustrate that bipartisanship is possible, he pointed to the record of Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown, who now holds the U.S. Senate seat once held by the late Ted Kennedy. "I understand there will be difficult situations in Washington where I might not be in step with my own party. My friend Scott Brown in Massachusetts, he has made that decision. He votes about 66 percent with his own party," said Doherty. "Republicans come up with good ideas and so do Democrats, and they need to work together and fight this gridlock." We wanted to see if Brown really has been willing to vote against his own party 34 percent of the time. To do that, we turned to the database of party-line votes compiled by The Washington Post. The Scott Brown pageconfirms that of the 433 votes he has cast, Brown has voted with his party 66 percent of the time. Among Republicans, only one senator, Dean Heller of Nevada, has voted against the party more often during the current session of Congress. (Cicilline, in contrast, voted with his fellow Democrats 96 percent of the time out of 1,550 votes, making him one of the most partisan members of the House.) The numbers don't tell the whole story because some of the votes are procedural. When you look at Brown’s votes on 20 issues the Post identified as "key" -- such as repealing the Don't Ask-Don't Tell policy for the military, extending unemployment insurance benefits, and ratifying the SALT treaty with Russia -- the percentage shifts. In 6 of those 20 issues, Republicans and Democrats agreed. On the remaining 14 issues where there was a split, Brown sided with his party in 10 instances (71 percent) and jumped ship to side with the Democrats in 4 cases (29 percent). (Cicilline is listed by the Post as having taken 23 "key" votes. On the 17 issues in which there was a party split, Cicilline voted with Democrats 13 times and sided with his party by declining to vote twice. That's 88 percent. He voted with the GOP in two instances [12 percent].) Our ruling Republican Brendan Doherty, attempting to illustrate how he would not be a lock-step Republican if elected to Congress, cited the example of Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown, saying that Brown "votes about 66 percent with his own party." Voting records show that Doherty is correct. Even when you look just at key votes where the political stakes were higher and members of the two parties came down on different sides of the issue, Brown's party-line score was 71 percent, still pretty close to the 66 percent mark. We rate Doherty's claim True. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on ourPolitiFact Rhode Island Facebookpage.)

pomt-09291	Says Gov. Rick Perry has never held a private-sector job.	false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/25/bill-white/democrat-bill-white-says-gov-rick-perry-has-never-/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White said last week that his November opponent, Gov. Rick Perry, has never held a private-sector job, the Wichita Falls Times Record News reported. Never is a long time. Is White right? First, we checked on whether the newspaper correctly quoted White. Why? The comment isn't in quotation marks in its article, raising the possibility the reporter made an inference. However, Lynn Walker, the Wichita Falls newspaperman who spoke with White on Tuesday, told us he jotted down “Perry never held a private-sector job” because that is what White told him “word for word.” When we called White's campaign about his comment, White spokeswoman Katy Bacon said White realized afterward he should have instead said something like Perry had “barely” or “hardly” any private-sector experience. She said a clarification was sent to the newspaper. Indeed, Perry has been a full-time state official for nearly 20 years. Before succeeding George W. Bush as governor in late 2000, he was lieutenant governor in 1999-2000 after serving two four-year terms as state agriculture commissioner. So how much private-sector experience does the governor have? Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle reminded us that Perry's background lies in his family's farming and ranching business in Haskell County, where he grew up. Born in March 1950, Perry attended Texas A&M University. After graduating in 1972, he was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force until he was discharged in 1977, with the rank of captain, according to his biographical entry in the Texas State Directory. In his autobiographical 2008 book, "On My Honor," Perry describes his return: "Dad still thought I was there to do chores. I reminded him that I had just finished commanding a multi-million-dollar piece of government equipment and a number of grown men. He reminded me that the chores still needed tending to." In a profile published by the Austin American-Statesman, Perry is quoted saying that in 1978 he was within weeks of starting training as a Southwest Airlines pilot when a heavy rain prompted him to knuckle down. “I just made the decision that this is where I need to be,” Perry said. Perry subsequently ran for the Texas House -- a position intended to be part time, paying less than $10,000 a year -- and won the first of his three two-year terms in 1984. Two former Haskell residents who’ve long known Perry said he worked in various ways in the 13 years between returning from the Air Force and being elected in 1990 to his first statewide office as agriculture commissioner. Semi-retired pharmacist Doyle High, who lives in Austin, said Perry farmed and ranched with his father and also worked as a pilot for someone who lived in Abilene. Consultant Don Comedy of Marble Falls, who said he lived near Perry at that time, also recalled Perry farming and ranching. Comedy said Perry and his father leased a ranch covering some 8,000 to 12,000 acres, making provision for hundreds of cows. “That first winter," after Perry left the Air Force, Comedy said, "we had several, eight to 10 days in row, the temperature never got above freezing. Rick was leaving the house in the morning before daylight, breaking ice on ponds so those cows could drink water... hauling hay, doctoring sick cows, riding horseback, coming in at night after dark... He was joking that at least in the Air Force, they had heaters in the airplane.” Comedy said Perry also went into business with a partner buying and selling airplanes; the partner has since died. Comedy said Perry also rented out space in buildings that he owned in Haskell. Andrew Gannaway, president of Haskell National Bank, said Perry served on the bank’s board of directors from 1983 through 1988, subsequently serving as an advisory director from 1989 to 1996. “He was involved in a family farming and ranching operation,” Gannaway said. “They were looking for local businessmen and folks who were a good representation of the community to serve on the board.” Perry's pre-government employment may not have been in typical 9-to-5 occupations, but it certainly qualifies as a "private-sector job." Bacon, White's spokeswoman, said he was making the point that he has considerably more private-sector experience — as a lawyer and businessman — than Perry does. That's not entirely what White said in Wichita Falls. We rate his statement as False.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-04-25T20:17:13	2010-04-20	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-12479	"President Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institutes of Health. And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night to not go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/03/jimmy-kimmel/jimmy-kimmel-largely-right-about-cuts-additions-ni/	During his widely watched monologue about his newborn son’s recent medical emergency, ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel offered a bit of praise for one group of Americans that doesn’t receive much love these days: members of Congress. "President Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institutes of Health. And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night to not go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion." Is that what happened? Basically, yes. Kimmel has a point that by approving the increase, both Republicans and Democrats in Congress rebuked Trump’s proposal and made clear a distaste for cutting NIH. Budget experts, however, may quibble that Kimmel oversimplified a bit on the numbers. First, some background. NIH conducts and disseminates research into the causes, diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. It is a collection of 27 separate institutes and centers, such as the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Explaining Kimmel’s comment starts with the release earlier this year of the Trump White House’s budget blueprint. While this proposal did not offer significant detail, it did include a cut for NIH. Specifically, the proposal would reduce spending for fiscal year 2018 by $5.8 billion compared to the fiscal 2017 level, through a range of reorganizations, consolidations and other changes. That’s short of a $6 billion cut, as Kimmel described it, but it’s pretty close. Fast-forward a few weeks to congressional negotiations over a bill to keep the government funded and avoid a government shutdown. Under the agreement reached by lawmakers, NIH would see a $2 billion increase in its budget over the five-month period of extended federal spending. (That's on top of the funding that was already expected.) According to news reports, the agreement provides an additional $400 million for Alzheimer’s disease and an additional $476 million for the National Cancer Institute, $120 million for the Precision Medicine Initiative, and an additional $110 million for the BRAIN Initiative, which aims to map the human brain. Where Kimmel oversimplified matters is on the numbers. Specifically, the $2 billion increase did not directly replace Trump’s $5.8 billion proposed cut -- the two actions are distinct, since they targeted two different fiscal years. It would have been more accurate to say that the $2 billion increase directly rejected a separate Trump proposal to cut $1.2 billion from NIH for the remainder of fiscal 2017, which concludes at the end of September. (Remember, the $5.8 billion cut was to be for the 2018 fiscal year, not for the rest of 2017.) Indeed, the Trump proposal to cut NIH by $5.8 billion in 2018 is still officially on the table since Congress hasn’t yet acted on spending for 2018. The agreement Kimmel cited only addresses a five-month extension of federal spending. That said, Kimmel’s overarching point -- that Congress effectively rejected Trump’s proposal to cut NIH -- is on target, experts say. Steve Ellis, vice president of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, agreed that while Kimmel oversimplified the numbers, he added that the talk show host’s "overall message is accurate. The administration sought cuts and Congress boosted the funding." And the decision to protect NIH in the budget has been supported not just by Democrats but also by key Republicans, including the chairmen of the two chambers’ health appropriations subcommittees, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., as well as Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. "There is no appetite on the Hill for cutting NIH," Stan Collender, a budget expert at the consulting firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, told PolitiFact. Our ruling Kimmel said, "President Trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the National Institutes of Health. And thank God our congressmen made a deal last night to not go along with that. They actually increased funding by $2 billion." Technically, the two funding changes Kimmel referenced are for different fiscal years, so Congress didn’t precisely exchange the increase for Trump’s proposed cut. But Kimmel’s broader point is solid: The move by Congress to increase, rather than decrease, NIH’s funding for the rest of the 2017 fiscal year is a signal that lawmakers are in no mood to cut NIH’s budget by $5.8 billion once the 2018 spending bills are taken up.

pomt-07510	"When I took office last year we faced historic budget deficits of $6 billion here in Virginia. And we closed those deficits by cutting spending."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/09/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-he-cut-6-billion-virginias-budg/	Gov. Bob McDonnell is urging the federal government to follow Virginia’s lead in slashing spending. "When I took office last year we faced historic budget deficits of $6 billion here in Virginia," McDonnell said on March 26 in delivering the Republican weekly radio address to the nation. "And we closed those deficits by cutting spending, not raising taxes." We agree that general state taxes have not increased since McDonnell took office on Jan. 16, 2010. But we wondered if he really did cut spending by $6 billion -- which amounts to 37.5 percent of the money Virginia spends each year on education, health and public safety. McDonnell, who is mentioned as a vice presidential prospect for the 2012 GOP ticket, has made the claim repeatedly. "We cut $6 billion out of our last two budgets," McDonnell wrote in a Jan. 31 column that ran in The Hill, a newspaper specializing in Congress that is well read by Washington insiders. An April 8 news letter issued by the governor’s political action committee, Opportunity Virginia, lauds McDonnell for "cutting $6 billion." Let’s start with some background: Unlike the federal government, Virginia and most states are constitutionally required to balance their budgets. Virginia’s General Assembly approves spending plans each year based on estimated revenues the state will receive from taxes and other sources of income. As the nation sank into recession in late 2008, Virginia and just about every other state saw revenues plummet. The lack of revenues to cover expenses creates a budget shortfall. McDonnell’s comments suggest there are two ways to repair a shortfall: cut spending or raise taxes. But there is a third option that the General Assembly usually prefers. It involves transferring money in state accounts and other bookkeeping gimmicks to alter paper balances. These steps are perfectly legal, done in the open, and are an integral part of managing Virginia’s annual budget of almost $38 billion. They provide short-term solutions during economic lulls that shield citizens from cuts in services or tax increases. The danger is that they can cause long-term structural problems in the budget if the actions are not rescinded when the economy improves. Congress gave Virginia a fourth option in early 2009 when it approved the $787 billion stimulus bill with hopes that a shot of federal money would jolt the economy out of recession. Virginia received $1.9 billion in one-time stimulus payments to help its budget problems. Two of McDonnell’s key advisers, Finance Secretary Ric Brown and Director of Communications Tucker Martin, told us in February that the governor’s $6 billion figure refers to the cumulative shortfalls Virginia faced from July 1, 2008 through last year. They acknowledged that many of the actions by McDonnell and the General Assembly took to balance the budget involved maneuvering accounts and using stimulus dollars -- not cutting spending. Our math shows that actual budget cuts accounted for about 39 percent of the dollar value of actions taken to balance the budget. Robert Vaughn, staff director of the House Appropriations Committee, helped us compile the numbers and did not dispute our conclusions. We found total cuts of about $2.34 billion. Most of it, $2 billion, came from reductions in funding to state agencies; the remainder came from trimming benefits for state employees. We came up with about $2.91 billion in transfers and bookkeeping maneuvers. Lawmakers helped support general services by diverting $850 million in scheduled contributions to the state pension. They withdrew $783 million from Virginia’s rainy day fund. They also found savings by using debt to finance some construction projects they had planned to pay for in cash, raising a variety of fees, moving up the monthly deadline for businesses to submit sales tax receipts to create an extra collection in 2010, and moving money from self-supporting programs into the state’s general fund to help pay for education, health programs and public safety. Finally, as we noted, Virginia received $1.9 billion in one-time federal stimulus payments. Of the money, $1.1 billion defrayed rising Medicaid costs and $800 million bolstered public schools. All told -- counting cuts, bookkeeping moves and stimulus -- we came up with $7.15 billion in cost-saving moves. That’s higher than the $6 billion figure McDonnell and others bandy about. But we have one more piece of math left. As we mentioned, Medicaid costs rose by $1.1 billion between 2008 and 2010 and were covered by the stimulus. So when we subtract that amount from the $7.15 billion, we get a $6.05 billion total in cost-saving actions -- roughly the same figure McDonnell uses. You won’t see a $6 billion reduction in the bottom line of Virginia budgets since mid-2008. To the contrary, overall spending increased by $800 million to a total $37.9 billion in the 2011 budget. But that’s not really a fair figure because the overall budget includes designated revenues that the state doesn’t fully control, such as college tuition payments and federal aid for highways. You can see $2.2 billion spending cuts if you look at the general fund budget, which pays for schools, health and public safety from general taxes. The fund dropped from $17 billion in 2008 to $14.8 billion in 2010. In the 2011 budget year, which ends June 30, the general fund rose to $15.4 billion. It’s set at $16 billion for the 2012 budget, which starts July 1. One more note: McDonnell said that when he took office in January 2010 "we faced historic budget deficits of $6 billion." That implies that the entire problem was solved under his watch. But the financial problems began at least 18 months before McDonnell took office. And McDonnell’s predecessor -- Democrat Tim Kaine -- announced budget actions to close a $2.5 billion shortfall in October 2008. Kaine, McDonnell and the General Assembly all share credit for closing a $6 billion gap. It’s impossible to precisely establish how much the shortfall was solved under McDonnell or Kaine. Numbers used by Kaine and McDonnell do not add up neatly. Some of the programs begun by Kaine were implemented by McDonnell, so who should get the credit? Kaine, by the way, is making a similar claim to McDonnell’s. The Democrat announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on April 5. The next day, at a news conference, he said: "We cut over $6 billion from the state budget by the time I finished being governor." We’ll look at that in the future. For now, let’s review McDonnell’s claim. The governor says he faced a $6 billion budget shortfall when he took office in January 2010 and "we closed those deficits by cutting spending." It’s true that Virginia that Virginia faced $6 billion in shortfalls between from 2008 through 2010. But the problems began long before McDonnell took office and so did some of the solutions. Kaine announced a plan to close $2.5 billion of thee budget gap in October 2008. It’s impossible to determine exactly how much of the shortfall was solved under McDonnell and how much under Kaine. McDonnell wrongly implies all off the $6 billion revenue shortfall was balanced with spending cuts. In fact, spending reductions accounted for about $2.34 billion of the sum. The rest came through bookkeeping maneuvers and federal stimulus dollars. McDonnell and the General Assembly deserve credit for balancing the budget without raising taxes during a brutal recession. McDonnell is accurate in saying spending was cut, but he greatly exaggerates how much. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2011-04-09T07:00:00	2011-03-26	['Virginia']

pomt-14017	Says Hillary Clinton has spoken "such lies about my foreign policy. They said I want Japan to … get nuclear weapons. Give me a break."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-accusing-hillary-clinton-lying-/	On the eve of a high-profile foreign-policy speech by Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump accused his rival of lying about what he’d said about Japan and nuclear weapons. At a rally in Sacramento on June 1, 2016, Trump said that Clinton has spoken "such lies about my foreign policy. They said I want Japan to nuke, that I want Japan to get nuclear weapons. Give me a break." (The excerpt is around the 11:40 mark here.) Trump had made a similar claim during a rally in San Diego, when he said Clinton "was saying that I want Japan to arm with nuclear weapons. I never said that." So who’s right? For the most part, Clinton is. (Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article.) Trump has been open to the idea of more nukes Clinton has periodically lobbed a charge along these lines. "A lot of what we’re hearing is not reassuring," she said in Rochester, N.Y., in April. "It is a kind of amateur hour, where they say whatever pops into their minds. Let’s pull out of NATO. Let’s let Japan and South Korea develop nuclear weapons." Her evidence includes interviews and comments Trump has made on the campaign trail. When Trump sat for a March 26 interview with the New York Times, he was asked directly, "Would you object if (Japan) got their own nuclear arsenal, given the threat that they face from North Korea and China?" Trump responded in part, "There’ll be a point at which we’re just not going to be able to do it anymore. Now, does that mean nuclear? It could mean nuclear. It’s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation. At the same time, you know, we’re a country that doesn’t have money." Let’s set aside Trump’s internal inconsistency -- saying that Japan might need nuclear weapons, and then, just seconds later, saying that the world’s "biggest problem" is nuclear proliferation. If you read his words closely, Trump didn’t quite say he wants Japan to get nuclear weapons, but he did go right up to the line. He was leaving the option on the table. Having seen Trump’s comments to the New York Times, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked him about it in a CNN town hall in Milwaukee on March 29. Answering Cooper’s question about breaking with Japan’s non-nuclear stance, Trump said, "At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea." In fact, during the town hall, Cooper gave Trump multiple opportunities to back off his suggestion that Japan may need nuclear weapons, but Trump never did. He said, in succession, "maybe it's going to have to be time to change," "at some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off," "it's going to happen, anyway," and "wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons?" That may not fit the strict definition of advocating, but again, it’s very close. Finally, Trump said something similar on the April 3 edition of Fox News Sunday, when host Chris Wallace pressed Trump on his past comments. After Wallace asked whether Trump wanted to see a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula, Trump said, "It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea." Wallace interjected, "With nukes?" Trump responded, "Maybe they would be better off -- including with nukes, yes, including with nukes." How unusual this position is We asked nuclear policy experts whether Trump’s stated position -- not specifically advocating that Japan get nuclear weapons, but saying he would be open to it -- was an unusual view, as Clinton suggested. They said it was. "The prevailing, bipartisan and fairly settled academic judgment has been that the risk of loose nukes or accidental nuclear war means that every additional nuclear weapon is a potential cataclysm waiting to happen," said Richard Nephew, a fellow with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. "I'm not aware of anyone that I'd deem to be a serious policy proponent or thinker who has seriously advocated this in a while." The last major figure Nephew could think of is Kenneth Waltz, an international relations scholar who articulated a "realist" view -- discussed in this 1981 paper -- that said the wide spread of nuclear weapons would create such risks to using them that no country ever would. However, "by the 1960s, most folks had decided that was a horrible idea," Nephew said. "You'd be hard pressed to find anyone saying that since the end of the Cold War." Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, agreed. The statements were so out of the mainstream that "our allies in Japan and the rest of Asia are already alarmed by those statements. Mr. Trump’s suggestion that a nuclear-armed Japan would make the United States or Japan safer is radical and highly dangerous, and is without precedent for a major party presidential nominee." Our ruling Trump said Clinton has spoken "such lies about my foreign policy. They said I want Japan to nuke, that I want Japan to get nuclear weapons. Give me a break." Trump didn’t literally say he wants Japan to go nuclear. But he came just about as close as someone can without saying those specific words -- certainly enough to undermine his flip dismissal, "Give me a break." On more than one occasion, Trump publicly said that Japan, and the United States, might be better off if Japan had nuclear weapons, and he declined multiple attempts by interviewers to backtrack from that view. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/95bd454f-b3ca-4291-b0ee-86d46e0e9dc6	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-02T14:39:21	2016-06-01	['Japan']

pomt-12673	"The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%" for Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election.	true	/california/statements/2017/mar/17/arnold-schwarzenegger/true-nothing-inflated-schwarzneggers-claim-average/	Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger won’t be back to host The New Celebrity Apprentice. He also recently squashed rumors he might run for U.S. Senate. That doesn’t mean, however, that the bodybuilder-turned-movie-star-turned-politician plans to fade quietly into the Hollywood sunset. Schwarzenegger’s next adventure is tackling what he calls America’s rigged political redistricting system. "Gerrymandering has created an absurd reality where politicians now pick their voters instead of the voters picking their politicians," Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said in a recent video. He cites reforms in California as a model for the nation: In 2008, voters in the state approved a bipartisan Citizens Redistricting Commission, which has been credited for drawing district boundaries in a way that’s made some state and congressional races more competitive. Schwarzenegger made a claim on Twitter and Facebook about just how lopsided congressional races have become nationwide: "The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%," he said on Twitter on Feb. 23, 2017, referring to the average percentage point victory for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election. "There are dictators who win by less." Given Schwarzenegger’s new focus, we decided to see whether his claim about margin of victory in House races is correct -- or all pumped up. Our fact check focused on his 37 percent figure. Our research We asked Schwarzenegger’s spokesman for evidence. He cited a breakdown of the 2016 election on the website ballotpedia.org. It’s an independent, online encyclopedia of American politics and elections. And, indeed, it lists the average margin of victory for members of the House at 37.1 percent. It notes that’s up from the 35.8 percent margin in 2014. We checked with one more knowledgeable source: Jack Pitney, a longtime professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College and former director of the Republican National Committee’s Research Department. Pitney crunched last year’s election numbers for us and found a 39 percent margin of victory for House members. He said he wasn’t sure what accounted for the slight difference in his findings. "But the bottom line is that Arnold's point -- House members win by big margins -- is essentially correct," Pitney said. What accounts for that huge margin? Pitney said part of it is deliberate gerrymandering, and part is that "constituencies are increasingly polarized." "Even in states where you don’t have a partisan (redistricting) process, Democrats tend to live in certain places. Republicans tend to live in others," the professor added. Supporters of California’s redistricting commission say it’s created more competitive districts. As an example, some cite California's 49th Congressional District, where incumbent Republican Darrell Issa defeated Democrat Douglas Applegate by 0.5 percent of the vote -- the smallest margin of any House race in the nation. Issa, who’s been in Congress since 2000, has won his district by 20 or even 30 percentage points in previous elections. But as the Washington Post reported in December 2016, the commission hasn’t led to changes in party control in any of California’s 53 congressional districts for several election cycles: "For the fourth time in 12 years, not a single one of the state's 50-plus congressional districts switched parties. Just as in 2010, 2008 and 2004, every single seat returned to the party that previously controlled it," the Post reported on Dec. 1, 2016, adding that "competitiveness has only ticked up slightly (in California’s congressional districts) under the new map." We asked Pitney how well the commission has performed: "There’s a debate about that," he told us. "Some argue that what appeared to be a nonpartisan process was actually gamed by Democrats. Be that as it may, the real reason for Democratic dominance in congressional elections is there’s just a lot more Democrats in California than there are Republicans. The state’s been trending heavily Democratic for years." About those dictators Schwarzenegger also mentioned the electoral margins for dictators. That's not part of this fact-check but we thought it would be fun to check their margins, too. In 2014, BBC News examined this topic in its article "The world of 100% election victories." Here’s what it found: -- North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un was elected in 2014 by the communist republic’s parliament with 100% votes -- Former North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il fared almost as well as his son in 2009, winning 99.9 % of votes -- Former Iraq President Saddam Hussein also won 100% votes in a 2002 referendum -- Cuban President Raúl Castro earned 99.4% votes in his 2008 election -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad secured 97.6% votes for his 2007 presidential referendum. Our ruling Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed the "average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%" among Republicans and Democrats during last year’s election. That claim is supported by the 37.1 percent margin calculated by independent election tracker ballotpedia.org and longtime politics professor Jack Pitney of Claremont McKenna College, who put the margin slightly higher at 39 percent.

pomt-11821	"Second Roy Moore Accuser Works For Michelle Obama Right NOW"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/14/thelastlineofdefenseorg/headline-tying-roy-moore-accuser-obamas-fake/	Conservative websites are firing back about the women who accused Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of dating teenagers when he was an adult. The Washington Post broke a story that four women said Moore pursued them when they were teenage girls and he was in his 30s. Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, is running in a Dec. 12 special election against Democrat Doug Jones. The Last Line of Defense website says in a Nov. 11 headline, "Second Roy Moore Accuser works for Michelle Obama right now." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article states that "Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore ‘groped her in the alley behind the’ church they both attended in 1957. The article then uses an alleged quote by Dourif on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow show: "It was the most horrifying moment of my life," she said. Dourif was not a guest on Rachel Maddow and never gave that quote. The website also falsely states that Dourif is employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at a Washington mansion. "This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that ‘Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif,' " states The Last Line of Defense. We searched the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, and found no mention of Dourif. There are several signs that the The Last Line of Defense article is fake news. First, Fiona Dourif is an actress born in 1981, so it would have been impossible for someone to molest her decades earlier. (Dourif played the role of Nica Pierce in the horror movies Cult of Chucky and Curse of Chucky.) Secondly, Moore would have been 10 years old in 1957. Third, a disclaimer on the Last Line of Defense’s website states: "America’s Last Line of Defense is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that’s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist. Names that represent actual people and places are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and do not in any way depict reality.In other words, if you believe this crap you’re a real dumbass." TheLastLineOfDefense.org is among the biggest sources of fake news online. The website was created by Christopher Blair who previously told PolitiFact he designed his parody site to fool conservatives with fake stories most people would find absurd. We messaged Blair on Facebook to ask about his post on Dourif "You're fact-checking fiction," he said. "There are satire disclaimers on every post." There is no evidence that Dourif accused Moore of groping her or that she works as Michelle Obama’s housekeeper. We rate this headline Pants on Fire!

pomt-05055	" ‘Obamacare’ puts the federal government between you and your doctor."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/09/mitt-romney/health-law-puts-government-between-patients-and-do/	The Republican position on the health care law is that it represents a government takeover of the health care system. In his response to the Supreme Court ruling to uphold the law, Mitt Romney stayed on message. "Perhaps most troubling of all, Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor," Romney said. This is a slightly different version of the broader statement about a government takeover, which PolitiFact has repeatedly found to be false and sometimes outrageously so. In fact, that claim was PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year. We will try to set the record straight on this particular assertion. We asked the Romney campaign to explain exactly how the Affordable Care Act puts the government between patient and doctor. We did not hear back, and Romney did not elaborate in his original comments. The overarching fact about the law is that it relies on the private sector. Employers still buy private health insurance for their workers. The law doesn’t change how much doctors are paid or what services they can provide, though it does create incentives and penalties to promote better care. (One example: It penalizes hospitals if patients are re-admitted soon after being discharged.) It establishes a minimum benefits package for insurance plans and fosters competition among health insurance companies by creating shopping websites. These sites, called exchanges, will allow customers to pick insurance plans the same way they might buy other things online, such as refrigerators or airplane tickets.The law also gives subsidies to people of limited means so they can buy their own insurance. If the health care law did get between doctors and patients, you would think most doctors would complain loudly. While some do, the leading physician advocacy group, the American Medical Association, does not. On the contrary, the AMA supports the law. After the Supreme Court upheld the health reform act, AMA president Jeremy Lazarus issued a statement praising the decision, because the law "will allow patients to see their doctors earlier rather than waiting for treatment until they are sicker and care is more expensive." Lazarus doesn’t see the law making life harder for doctors; he sees it making life easier. He said it "simplifies administrative burdens, including streamlining insurance claims, so physicians and their staff can spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork." Beyond the AMA, about nine other physician advocacy groups back all or major portions of the reform law, including the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Cardiology. Specialists tend to be more concerned about the impact of health care reform than the primary doctors, and that chiefly centers on the Medicare program. The law sets up a panel to keep Medicare spending in check. The 15-member panel is called the Independent Payment Advisory Board and starting in 2020, it can recommend changes in reimbursement rates and other cost-saving measures. Health reform law opponents sometimes speak of this panel as a backdoor to rationing, but as PolitiFact has noted many times, claims about the IPAB are often exaggerated. The law specifically prohibits the panel from suggesting anything that leads to rationing or reductions in either benefits or eligibility. Further, Congress has the power to overrule the panel’s recommendations. The law’s significant changes in the health insurance market are another source of concern. Dr. Dick Armstrong, the chief operating officer of Docs4PatientCare, a group opposed to the law, says Washington will be able to define the best practices for treating patients. The government would enforce those guidelines through the insurance companies and require them to reimburse only that care that matches those best practices. Armstrong said this will "shut out" doctors who don’t follow those rules. "Best practice guidelines can reduce costs," Armstong said. "But guidelines become dangerous in the hands of people who tie them to money." The law is sweeping and is designed to have an effect on the quality and cost of care. But to assume that the outcomes will only be negative requires a very selective reading of federal law that overlooks many checks on federal authority. First, Washington has given states the authority to set the standards for insurance plans so they can respond to local conditions. Second, the law calls for creation of "strategies to align public and private payers with regard to quality and patient safety efforts," and insurance company participation in those exchanges is part of that effort. But the law also expressly allows insurance plans to operate outside the exchanges. Third, the strongest federal efforts to control spending lie in the federal Medicare program, not in the private market. Within Medicare, participation in the biggest cost-saving pilot -- Accountable Care Organizations -- is voluntary. The Accountable Care Organizations are intended to bring doctors and specialists together to treat patients and include financial incentives. Fourth, all regulations must pass through an extensive public review process. We came across one opinion poll that showed doctors evenly split on the broad question of whether the health reform law is a step in the right or the wrong direction. However, the poll’s methodology raised some red flags. It reached out to about 16,000 doctors, but only about 500 responded. In that group, specialists outnumbered primary care doctors two to one. The specialists overall were much more likely to worry that reform would drive their pay down. Surgical specialists were the most likely to say that health reform was a step in the wrong direction. Our ruling For three years, Republicans have insisted that the health care reform bill amounts to a government takeover of health care. Romney’s statement that the law puts government between you and your doctor is another iteration of that claim. The law does aim to improve the quality and efficiency of care. At some level, that would change what doctors do. Physicians are wary of change, and the way the law will work is complex. But we found no hard evidence to support the claim that doctors would be forced to make bad decisions. In contrast, we found many provisions that support an open process geared toward providing better care. Primary care doctors seem most inclined to support the law, as do a large number of physician professional associations. Support for the law is weaker among specialists, who are more likely to question what it means for their compensation and more likely to face scrutiny for using high-cost tests and procedures. But that doesn’t mean the government is placing itself between doctors and patients. The law is complex, but it leaves intact the private sector delivery of health care. Overall, we found some concerns that government influence over the private insurance market will dictate doctor behavior. But statements like Romney’s overstate the level of government control in the law and ignore state flexibility in setting insurance standards. Romney’s campaign offered no evidence to back up this claim. We rule this statement False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-07-09T10:58:44	2012-06-28	['None']
pomt-09911	Mitch McConnell opposed "legislation to create and protect Kentucky jobs . . . help for the unemployed. . . health care for Kentucky's children," and "fair pay for women."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/06/democratic-national-committee/mitch-mcconnell-dnc-ad-distorted/	A television ad from the Democratic National Committee gives the impression that Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell hates jobs, unemployment compensation, health care for little children and equal pay for women. Here's the full text of the ad: "When George Bush asked Mitch McConnell to support the policies that brought our economy to its knees, what did he say? Yes, Yes, Yes. But this year, when it came to supporting legislation to create and protect Kentucky jobs, he said no. Help for the unemployed? No. Health care for Kentucky's children? No. Fair pay for women? No. "Call Mitch McConnell. Tell him after eight years of being part of the problem, it's time to be part of the solution." As the announcer talks, tiny type indicates Senate bill numbers to support the ad's claims. The problem is that the ad takes McConnell's votes and then exaggerates what the votes signify. We'll take the issues in order. McConnell said no to "legislation to create and protect Kentucky jobs" and to "help for the unemployed." The Democratic National Committee's documentation on the ad says that the evidence for this statement is that McConnell voted against the economic stimulus bill, also known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It's true that McConnell voted against the act, as did all but three Republican senators. (The exceptions were Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who subsequently switched parties.) But we found evidence that McConnell opposed the bill because of its significant expense, not because he opposed creating jobs or helping the unemployed. The week before the vote, for example, McConnell said he opposed the bill because it "lacked focus, didn't create enough jobs, had too much permanent government expansion, and was just way too expensive with the national debt already reaching frightening new dimensions." Republicans in both the Senate and the House supported extensions for unemployment compensation in alternative proposals, but the proposals couldn't pass the Democratic-controlled Senate. McConnell said at the time that Republicans weren't trying to derail the stimulus but make it more efficient. We also found a long list of jobs-oriented projects for which McConnell is requesting money in the next appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010. All this contradicts the impression the ad gives that McConnell said no to creating jobs or helping the unemployed. McConnell said no to "health care for Kentucky's children." The DNC backs up this claim by citing McConnell's vote against an expansion for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. The program provides health insurance to children in families with low income. The bill passed anyway with about eight Republicans voting with Democrats, and President Barack Obama signed it into law. McConnell recently sponsored legislation to continue SCHIP under more restrictive eligibility terms than the 2009 legislation. He also voted for the creation of SCHIP in 1997 during the Clinton administration. So again this seems to be a case where McConnell disagreed with the legislative specifics, not the underlying value of health care for children. McConnell said no to "fair pay for women." Here, the DNC pointed to McConnell's vote against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first law Obama signed after taking office. This bill reversed the effects of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that said workers had to file lawsuits for pay discrimination within 180 days of the first instance of discriminatory pay. The new law says a lawsuit may be filed 180 days from the most recent instance of disciminatory pay. McConnell voted against the bill, but not because he opposes fair pay. "We have heard a lot of debate over the past few days on fairness," McConnell said in a statement. "Every member of this body supports equal pay for equal work. The Ledbetter bill isn't about fair pay. Pay discrimination has been illegal since 1963. This bill is about effectively eliminating the statute of limitations on pay discrimination." McConnell supported an amendment proposed by Sen. Kay Baily Hutchison of Texas that said the clock for a lawsuit started ticking when the worker knew or could reasonably have been expected to know about the pay disparity, as well as other restrictions. But the motion failed. All the Democrats voted for the Ledbetter bill, along with five Republicans: Collins, Snowe, Specter, Hutchison and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. To summarize: The ad from the DNC makes sweeping generalizations about what McConnell opposed, to the point of distorting what the votes actually signified. When we dug into the nitty gritty of the Senate votes, we found that McConnell supported alternatives or objected to the legislation for other reasons. The ad says that McConnell opposed legislation to "create and protect Kentucky jobs," "help for the unemployed," "health care for Kentucky's children," and "fair pay for women." Actually, McConnell said he supported all of those values, but he didn't agree with Democratic methods for achieving them. It's an important distinction. We rate the ad from the Democratic National Committee as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2009-07-06T18:44:41	2009-07-02	['Kentucky', 'Mitch_McConnell']
pomt-09779	On a cap-and-trade plan.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/24/tim-pawlenty/pawlenty-changes-coursse-cap-and-trade/	He hasn't made it official yet, but it seems everything Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty does these days points to a White House run in 2012. Case in point: his stance on a cap-and-trade plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Back in 2007, Pawlenty was positioning himself as an environmental leader, pushing for aggressive reductions in greenhouse gases and a regional cap-and-trade plan. Fast-forward to 2009, and he's writing letters to Washington calling a Democratic plan to curb climate change "overly bureaucratic, misguided" and "very burdensome on our economy." "His position has evolved very dramatically from someone our group, quite frankly, viewed as a champion" for the climate, said Steven Morse, executive director of the Minnesota Environmental Partnership, a coalition of more than 80 Minnesota environmental organizations. To track Pawlenty's evolution from treehugger to cap-and-trade skeptic, we need to turn the clock back to 2007. At the time, the Minnesota Legislature was debating the Next Generation Energy Act of 2007, which outlined the state's goals for greenhouse gas reductions. The bill required the state to reduce its emissions 15 percent by 2015 and 80 percent in 2050. It also endorsed the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group, a panel charged with drafting a comprehensive greenhouse gas emission reduction plan to meet those goals. On May 25, 2007, the day Pawlenty signed the bill, he said the state should have taken action 30 years ago. "The nation has been asleep at the switch, but here in Minnesota we are kick-starting the future by increasing our nation-leading per capita renewable fuel use, boosting cost-saving measures and tackling greenhouse gas emissions," he said. Morse said the bill was a major victory for the state, in no small part because it was a bipartisan effort; indeed, Pawlenty had actively pushed for the legislation. Pawlenty grew his reputation as an environmental pioneer when he played a leading role in persuading members of the Midwest Governors Association to sign the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, an agreement that the states would develop a cap-and-trade mechanism to achieve greenhouse gas reductions in the area. The list of Pawlenty's climate change achievements goes on, including the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group, which he formed to study the impact of climate change and make recommendations for the state. You get the picture. So it was surprising to Morse and other Minnesota environmentalists when Pawlenty wrote a letter to the Minnesota delegation in Washington expressing his opposition to a bill authored by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey that would set up a national cap-and-trade program to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 — only slightly more ambitious than Pawlenty's climate change goals for Minnesota. "This legislation would place significant burdens on individuals and job creators, while doing little to impact its intended goal of changing climate change," he wrote on June 24. He described the cap-and-trade provisions in the bill as "overly bureaucratic, misguided" and "very burdensome on our economy." "I oppose any cap-and-trade system that does not set emissions caps at pragmatic levels or fails to provide free allowances to producers instead of creating an expensive auction that would bid up prices and in turn dramatically increase energy costs," Pawlenty wrote in ending the letter. Generally speaking, Minnesota environmentalists say Pawlenty has recently been less aggressive on other climate issues, such as implementing the recommendations of the Minnesota Climate Change Advisory Group. "He's silent where he used to be a leader," said Samantha Chadwick, an environmental associate for Environment Minnesota. Pawlenty has even used the issue to poke fun at the Obama administration. "Apparently, they're announcing that President Obama is making great progress on climate change," he said in a July speech to the Republican National Committee. "He's turning the political climate of the country back to Republicans." Steven Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., says Pawlenty's conservative tone is a signal of his impending run for president. "Republicans in Minnesota tend to be an ideologically conservative bunch," he said. "If anything, Pawlenty is a bit to the left of his party. His rhetoric has been more conservative in the last few months than it's been most of his career as governor of Minnesota. ... He's repositioned himself." No matter what Pawlenty's motivations, "I would call it pretty much a 180-degree evolution," said Morse. We couldn't have said it better. Pawlenty has clearly changed his tune on cap-and-trade. We give him a Full Flop.	None	Tim Pawlenty	None	None	None	2009-09-24T14:37:47	2009-06-24	['None']
pomt-00175	Says Democrats "want to give (undocumented immigrants) cars."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-democrats-want-give-cars-undocum/	Want a free car? President Donald Trump has told his audiences that undocumented immigrants are in luck, if the Democrats have their way. In an Oct. 19 rally in Mesa, Ariz., Trump said, "Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare, free health care, and free education. Give them a driver's license. Give them a driver's license. Next thing you know, they want to buy them a car. Then they'll say the car's not good enough, how about a Rolls-Royce?" The hypothetical morphed into something more the following day at a rally in Elko, Nev. No longer was this idea simply the "next thing" Democrats were going to dream up — by then, the Democratic proposal he mentioned had purportedly already surfaced. Referring to Democrats, Trump said, "They want to take away your Second Amendment. They want to raise your taxes. They want to open your borders — let people in, illegally. And then they want to pay for those people for health care, for education. They want to give them cars, they want to give them driver's licenses. I said last night — we did a great, great rally in Arizona last night — and I said last night, what kind of car will they supply them? Will it be a Rolls-Royce?" Twelve states have indeed chosen to offer driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants, which cannot be used for federal identification purposes. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, they are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Vermont and Washington, along with the District of Columbia. Typically, an applicant must provide certain documents to obtain one, such as a foreign birth certificate, a foreign passport, or a consular card, along with evidence of current residency in the state. (Many of these states are solidly Democratic in their leanings, though some such as Nevada and New Mexico are mixed, and Utah is solidly Republican.) But cars? That’s fantasy. Based on Google and Nexis searches, we found no indication that any Democratic official had proposed giving free cars to undocumented immigrants, be it a Rolls-Royce or a clunker. "I’ve never heard any plan to give illegal immigrants cars at taxpayer expense," said Alex Nowrasteh, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who closely tracks legislative proposals on immigration. Asked whether he’d heard any of discussion of this idea among congressional Democrats, Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Trump’s remark was "fiction." We reached out to the White House but did not receive a reply. Our ruling Trump said that Democrats "want to give (undocumented immigrants) cars." There is no evidence for this.

pomt-10698	Barack Obama's health care plan "would leave 15-million Americans out."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/03/hillary-clinton/15-million-is-okay-guess-but-not-a-fact/	Sen. Barack Obama "talks a lot about stepping up and taking responsibility and taking strong positions," Sen. Hillary Clinton said during a debate in November 2007, "but when it came time to step up and decide whether or not he would support universal health care coverage, he chose not to do that. His plan would leave 15-million Americans out." Clinton is accurately quoting studies that estimate how many will be uninsured under Obama's plan. But some experts think the plans don't offer enough detail to create a reliable estimate for such a complex issue, casting doubt on the validity of a hard number. Obama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as Clinton's plan does. That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University. Clinton believes 15-million people would be left uncovered because of that lack of mandate. She based her analysis on an article written by Jonathan Cohn of the New Republic who quoted RAND, the Urban Institute and MIT economist Jonathan Gruber. Realistically, though, the claim is an educated guess. Given that 47-million people are uninsured now, 15-million uninsured after Obama's plan doesn't seem unreasonable, according to several experts — it would mean that Obama succeeded in covering almost 70 percent of those currently uninsured. But neither Clinton nor Obama offer hard numbers on what income levels would qualify for what programs. Given the limited data, other experts question the hard number. It's a tough call, but because of the disagreements here, we find her claim to be based on too many hypotheticals to rate more than a Half True.

pomt-02520	Female buffalo lead the herd.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/11/hugh-fitzsimons/female-leadership-nothing-new-buffalo/	One of the Democratic candidates for Texas agriculture commissioner recently made a ranching claim that caught our eye. Hugh Fitzsimons, who’s been endorsed by lieutenant governor candidate Leticia Van de Putte, referred to her and gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis in a lighthearted (if perhaps hastily typed) way in a Jan. 19, 2014, blog post: "I’ve learned from my bison that is it the female buffalo that lead heard. It is time for Texas to have women leading our state, and Senators Davis and Van de Putte will make sure Texas does do better." The ag commissioner race is crowded -- 3 Democrats and 5 Republicans have filed to run -- and bison leadership has not been a prime topic. Campaign issues the candidates have raised include the state’s water supply, federal government subsidies and regulations and managing the Texas Department of Agriculture budget. But for a moment, we were curious about female leaders among the bison, commonly called buffalo. Via email, Texas Bison Association president Roy Liedtke told us, "Yes, it is common that a bison herd have a ‘lead cow.’ This is usually an older cow and she is the leader of the herd. As with many undomesticated animals, the bulls are with the herd during breeding season and frequently spend the rest of the time alone in a bachelor herd." We also checked with Donald Beard, superintendent of Caprock Canyons State Park, where the state’s buffalo roam. (The Official Bison Herd of the State of Texas began with stock saved by ranchers Charles and Molly Goodnight in 1878 and was donated to the state in 1996.) By email, Beard told us, "Hugh is correct about the females’ status in the herd. North American bison are very much a matriarchal society. In fact, the males generally stay away from the main herd and will either be solo or in ‘bachelor’ groups until the breeding season. Once the rut begins, however, the large males return to the herd and fight each other for the right to breed. You will find males dominating the females during this time." Main herds, Beard said by phone, will consist mainly of cows, calves, yearlings and perhaps 2- or 3-year-olds, including males. In the mating season, starting around late June and extending 60 to 90 days, the big bulls return to a herd and break it up into harem groups, he said. At Yellowstone National Park, where 4,600 bison range, team leader Rick Wallen of the Bison Ecology and Management Program emailed us more detail: "The larger groups are mixed gender with adult females being the primary leaders of those groups. ... During the breeding season (July and August), some of the older bulls will join the cow/calf groups to contribute their genes to the next generation. I would argue that the older cows tend to lead those groups around the landscape and not the older males." Fitzsimons told us by phone that those descriptions match his experience, with males splitting off and roaming as "satellite bulls" most of each year. The cows keep the main herd disciplined, and when the bulls return, the females maintain some control: "They choose the bull when it comes to mating," he said. Bison find calmness, social stability and safety in herds, he said. "Not to anthropomorphize too much, but it really does make you think about the role of women." Footnote: Females also lead herds of cattle, elk and elephants. The National Wildlife Federation -- in a Feb. 16, 2011, blog post on social organization that asked, "Does a gorilla want a strong central government? Does a bear?" -- listed bison, ants, African lions and sperm whales as species with female leadership roles. "Females rule in the animal kingdom," the post concluded. Our ruling Fitzsimons, making a point about putting women in charge, said that female buffalo lead the herd. Bison are a matriarchal society, though female bison don’t lead the entire population. Adult males split off on their own until each mating season, when they come back to carve up the main herd for a couple months. We’ll rate Fitzsimons’ statement as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-04831	Says Paul Ryan's budget relies on the same $700 billion in savings from Medicare that Mitt Romney and other Republicans have been attacking Democrats about.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/15/stephanie-cutter/ryans-plan-includes-700-billion-medicare-cuts-says/	Mitt Romney’s pick of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate has rekindled a heated debate over Medicare. Ryan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare. Today, Medicare operates as a government-run health insurance plan for Americans over age 65. Ryan’s idea is to eventually move Medicare toward private insurance companies by giving people a set amount to buy their own health insurance plans. The new system would be for people who are under age 55 now, and it would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called "premium support.") Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan’s plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, with older voters the most wary of the plan. The Republican response to attacks on the Ryan plan has been to attack back, saying President Barack Obama has cut "$700 billion" out of Medicare. And the Democratic response to that: Well, Paul Ryan cuts that amount, too! For this check, we’re looking specifically at what Obama campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said on Face the Nation when debating Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom. "You know, I heard Mitt Romney deride the $700 billion cuts in Medicare that the president achieved through health care reform," Cutter said. "You know what those cuts are? It’s taking subsidies away from insurance companies, taking rebates away from prescription drug company. Is that what Mitt Romney wants to protect? And interestingly enough Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget." It’s a lot to digest if you’re not already a Medicare policy wonk, so let us sort it out for you. For now, we are going to put aside the question of whether it is accurate to call them "cuts" -- a claim we're checking in another item -- and focus on the question of whether Cutter is correct that Ryan relies on those same reductions in his budget. $700 billion in Medicare cuts? Because we’re wonks ourselves at PolitiFact, our ears pricked up at the claim in recent days that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare. Just a few weeks ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking? Well, there are cuts and then there are CUTS. Neither Obama nor his health care law literally "cut" a dollar from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to reduce the growth of Medicare costs. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Still, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. So it’s timing that’s making the "cuts" bigger, not changes to Medicare. Does the Ryan budget ‘protect those cuts’? Now onto our second question: Does Ryan’s budget keep the reductions in Medicare spending? The short answer is yes. Here’s what Ryan said in an interview with George Stephanopolous of ABC News in June, before his selection as Romney’s running mate: Stephanopoulos: "You know, several independent fact-checkers have taken a look at that claim, the $500 billion in Medicare cuts, and said that it's misleading. And in fact, by that accounting, your budget, your own budget, which Gov. Romney has endorsed, would also have $500 billion in Medicare cuts. Ryan: "Well, our budget keeps that money for Medicare to extend its solvency. What Obamacare does is it takes that money from Medicare to spend on Obamacare. ..." (Read the full exchange.) So Ryan has confirmed his budget includes the Medicare savings. The Romney campaign got questions on this point the day after Cutter’s remarks, and issued a statement saying that Romney intended to fully repeal the federal law, including the savings for Medicare. "Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama’s $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces," said Lanhee Chen, Romney’s policy director, in a statement reported by NBC News. "A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare, ensure that no changes are made to the program for those 55 or older, and implement the reforms that they have proposed to strengthen it for future generations." Cutter, though, was talking about the Ryan budget. We should point out that the Ryan budget is a congressional resolution that doesn’t have the force of law. And its plan for Medicare hasn’t been turned into legislation that could be analyzed in detail by the Congressional Budget Office. Still, Ryan himself said his plan did include the reductions in future spending that were part of the federal health care law. That’s because both sides agree on one point: Medicare spending is growing too rapidly, and it needs to reined in. Our ruling Cutter said that Romney attacked Obama for cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, but "Paul Ryan protected those cuts in his budget." Again, with this item we are not addressing whether they are cuts, but simply whether she is correctly characterizing Ryan's plan. Cutter is correct that the Ryan budget plan included cost savings that were part of the future health care law. Just recently, the Romney campaign backed away from that play, saying Romney’s plan would restore the spending that the health law is set to curtail, such as extra funding for private insurers under the Medicare Advantage plan. Still, Cutter was right about the Ryan plan. We rate her statement True.

pomt-10045	"Nancy Pelosi wants a Windfall Tax on Retirement Income."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/11/chain-email/Pelosi-windfall-profits-stocks-email/	Chain e-mails, generally characterized by exclamation points, typos and a strained relationship with the truth, were perhaps the most effective distribution method for falsehoods in the 2008 presidential campaign. They spread like viruses, infecting the ill-informed and anyone unfortunate enough to be in their address book. But they live on. This one targets Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat and speaker of the House of Representatives, accusing her of trying to take money from retirees and give it to illegal immigrants. A version of this e-mail popped up as early as October 2006, just before the Democrats won control of the House. "'Only the rich benefit from these record highs,'" it alleged Pelosi said about the stock market. "'There is no question these windfall profits and income created by the Bush administration need to be taxed at 100 percent rate and those dollars redistributed to the poor and working class.'" Pelosi never said anything of the kind. (If she had, it's reasonable to conclude it would have hampered her fundraising, which netted $151,000 from the securities and investment sector in the past two years.) A more recent version, forwarded numerous times to PolitiFact from readers imploring us to check it out, shares the same thrust, though it is in a class by itself when it comes to misplaced capital letters. "Nancy Pelosi wants a Windfall Tax on Retirement Income," it says. "Madam speaker [where's that shift key when you need it?] Nancy Pelosi wants to put a Windfall Tax on all stock market profits, including Retirement fund, 401K and Mutual Funds! Alas, it is true — all to help the 12 Million Illegal Immigrants and other unemployed Minorities!" "Send it on to your friends," the e-mail concludes. "I just did!! This lady is out of her mind." Pelosi's office is well-practiced at responding to inquiries about this hoax, and did so with a prepared letter from the speaker: "Internet and e-mail rumors indicating that I support a windfall profits tax on earnings from the stock market are completely and utterly fabricated," Pelosi's letter says. "In addition, my record on promoting retirement security and strengthening 401(k)'s and other savings incentives in the tax code contradict these rumors." The Democratic presidential candidates kicked around the idea of a windfall tax on oil companies, and Democrats support the idea of raising the capital gains tax rate somewhat. But there simply is not a shred of proof in the public record that Pelosi has ever advocated anything even remotely like the windfall tax described in these e-mails. In her letter she provided links to two other fact-checkers who have debunked these e-mails, Snopes.com and Truthorfiction.com. She might consider adding FactCheck.org — they took on this hoax on Jan. 14, 2009. And by all means, feel free to add us to the list. This chain e-mail, distinguished by its longevity and implausibility, is Pants on Fire wrong.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-02-11T14:12:50	2009-01-12	['Nancy_Pelosi']

pomt-11753	"GDP is booming. Let’s spread the prosperity to the middle class with big #TaxCuts. Our #TaxReform package doubles standard deduction, brings $$$ back home, and reduces rates for ALL taxpayers. We will #MAGA."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/dec/06/lou-barletta/pa-rep-lou-barletta-overstates-benefits-house-tax-/	After a failed attempt at health care reform, Republican leaders in Congress are working on reforming tax policy. The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Nov. 16. Rep. Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania’s 11th District tweeted a slew of claims about tax reform a few days before the Senate passed their own tax bill early Saturday morning. The following was tweeted on Nov. 29 from Barletta’s account: "GDP is booming. Let’s spread the prosperity to the middle class with big #TaxCuts. Our #TaxReform package doubles standard deduction, brings $$$ back home, and reduces rates for ALL taxpayers. We will #MAGA." Barletta, who voted in favor of the House bill, has a list of reasons the legislation could benefit taxpayers. However, we wanted to see if "ALL taxpayers" will have reduced tax rates. In support of the House bill First, we confirmed that Barletta was referring to the House version of the bill in his tweet. One of the major differences between the two bills is the number of income tax brackets and corresponding tax rates. The House bill changes the current number of seven tax brackets to four, which would be 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. On average, each income group will receive a tax cut David Jackson, a spokesman for Barletta, sent a report on the House bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee in Congress, as the source for Barletta’s tweet. "According to the Joint Committee, in 2019, Americans in every income category will see a tax cut," Jackson told PolitiFact Pennsylvania. The table in the report shows that, on average, each income group will have a reduced effective tax rate in 2019 compared to the current law. But that isn’t what Barletta tweeted. Barletta’s tweet made it seem as if every single taxpayer will see a rate reduction, which contradicts a report released by the Tax Policy Center. In 2018, if broken down into quintiles, a little more than 7 percent of individuals will be subjected to an increased tax rate. About 75 percent of individuals will receive a tax cut. "There are specific individuals in each income group that would actually pay higher taxes," Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact Pennsylvania. In 2018, the percentage of individuals with a tax increase in the lowest income distribution would be 1.7 percent, 6 percent in the second, 9.2 percent in the middle, 11.5 percent in the fourth and 12.9 percent in the top. The ‘chained Consumer Price Index’ and ‘bubble rate’ create some tax rate increases The House and Senate bill both propose using chained CPI to index standard deductions according to inflation. Standard deductions include $12,000 for single filers, $18,300 for households and $24,400 for joint filers in the House bill. Starting in 2018, the chained CPI would also move some individuals into higher tax brackets at a faster pace since bracket cutoffs would be moved in relation to a lower inflation measure. Gleckman said that process will contribute to average tax rates going up by 2027. This will likely increase the percentage of individuals with tax rate increases in 2027 to more than 25 percent compared to the 7 percent in 2018. "What will happen is middle-income people and lower-income people will end up paying slightly higher taxes than they do under current law," Gleckman said. At first, the bill will increase the effective tax rates of some individuals in the top 1 percent. The "bubble rate" put in the bill for individual income rates and brackets would make the top effective tax rates rise to 49.4 percent for some high-income taxpayers, and then fall by 2027. "Over time, the tax rates of the poor and middle class move higher than they were in 2017," Temple University economics professor Michael Leeds said, "while the taxes of the rich and ultra-rich stay below 2017 levels [in 2027]." Our Ruling Barletta tweeted that "ALL taxpayers" will have reduced tax rates. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, all income categories from less than $10,000 to $1,000,000 and over will receive a tax cut on average. But that doesn’t mean that every single taxpayer will pay less in taxes in 2019. About 7 percent of taxpayers will see their tax rates increase in 2018. Barletta’s spokesman clarified that the tweet was in reference to every income category in 2019 under the House bill. However, the wording in the tweet misrepresented the cuts and increases taxpayers will receive that year. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-01356	Says David Perdue built his business career outsourcing American jobs.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/21/michelle-nunn/outsourcing-doesnt-always-mean-moving-jobs/	The neck-and-neck battle for Georgia’s open U.S. Senate seat appears to have found its flash point: outsourcing. The race had already focused heavily on the careers of Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue, given both are political novices. But Nunn, the head of the nonprofit Points of Light Foundation, has increased the drumbeat against former Fortune 500 executive Perdue since a 2005 deposition surfaced with him saying he "spent most of my career" outsourcing. In the business world, the term refers generally to the process of contracting out jobs or work abroad that had been done, or could be done, in-house. For workers just easing out of the Great Recession, outsourcing represents a threat to job security and job growth. Democrats, aware of that perceived threat by voters, have worked since summer to paint Perdue’s business record as one that benefited him and not his employees. But the deposition has given Nunn new ammunition, prompting updated claims in ads and in the Oct. 7 debate at the Georgia National Fair. "He would be the only senator who, from his own words, has built a career from outsourcing American jobs," Nunn said. "That is not the experience we need in Washington." Given the reload, PolitiFact decided to see whether the deposition moves the needle on a previous Truth-O-Meter ruling that it was Half True that Perdue’s business record focused on shipping American jobs overseas. First up, a primer on the deposition. It was taken as part of a lawsuit following the bankruptcy of Pillowtex, a North Carolina firm that failed shortly after Perdue’s brief stint as its CEO. A claim during the GOP runoff election that Perdue was to blame for the firm’s collapse earned a Mostly False ruling this summer, largely given the company’s financial woes that predated his tenure. Perdue, however, did tell PolitiFact Georgia that before the extent of Pillowtex’s money troubles was revealed, his turnaround plan for the company was a mix of outsourcing and marketing. It called for lower-end products to be made in Asia, while brand-name items would be American-made. Perdue said the same thing in the deposition. But those statements, and the company’s business records, reveal outsourcing plans at Pillowtex were not an effort to eliminate American jobs, said Rob Bliss, a professor of finance at Wake Forest University. The plan – which was never implemented – was instead designed to save at least some domestic jobs in an industry that had largely moved overseas, Bliss said. "There is nothing to suggest he was narrowly moving jobs overseas just to increase profits or give himself a bonus," Bliss said. "Moving jobs overseas would have been an effort to make the company more competitive. It’s a perfectly legitimate thing to do." In Pillowtex’s case, there was only a failed plan to move jobs. PolitiFact Georgia did find evidence that American jobs were lost in other firms Perdue helped manage or lead. Sara Lee eliminated between 8,000 and 9,000 jobs worldwide – mostly in the United States and Europe – in a 1994 restructuring. At the time, Perdue was the senior vice president for the company’s operations in Asia. He confirms in the deposition that he successfully increased manufacturing and contracts in the region as part of that job. At the same time, the company was closing four plants in Georgia, eliminating at least 540 jobs. Nunn’s earlier claim using those facts was ruled True. The deposition also refers to Perdue’s time as a senior VP with the Haggar Clothing Co. between 1996 and 1998. Perdue does not mention details of his time there, though PolitiFact research showed 1,950 American jobs were lost at Haggar during that period. Business records show the firm also shed 65 foreign jobs in those two years, indicating an overall business decline in addition to any move to foreign production. "He was part of a bad scene in American industry," said Kerwin Swint, the chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. "But trying to say he doesn’t care about American workers, that’s a leap." Taken together, Perdue’s own words in the legal interrogation only reveal what was already known about his business career. He managed and led companies in industries where jobs were being lost to both cheaper foreign production – outsourcing – and also to technology and global business trends far outside his scope of control. Moreover, the deposition was taken two years before Perdue, as CEO of Dollar General, persuaded the discount chain to sell to a private equity firm. At the time, he had grown the chain from 5,900 to 8,500 stores, adding about 19,000 part-time and full-time jobs. "Politically, it’s a good strategy to focus on the outsourcing, but that doesn’t mean it’s accurate and fair," Swint said. "There is more to it." We agree. It is accurate to claim Perdue’s sworn statement is that he spent most of his business career outsourcing. But that doesn’t translate into callous indifference to American workers – or even a tenure that did nothing more than ship jobs abroad. We continue to rate the claim Half True.

pomt-10370	Says Obama opposes offshore drilling and a gas tax holiday.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/27/john-mccain/james-bond-inspired-ad-is-on-target-about-drilling/	A new Web video from Sen. John McCain's campaign invokes James Bond to portray Sen. Barack Obama as an opponent of McCain's energy initiatives. With music that sounds like the 007 theme, the ad opens with Obama in silhoutte and the words "Barack Obama Is Dr. No." The words change to "No To Drilling Offshore Oil" while Obama is heard saying, "Offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today." The screen says, "No To A Gas Tax Holiday" while Obama says, "I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month tax holiday is a bad idea." "No To Innovation. No To The Electric Car" appears on the screen while Obama says "In this campaign, John McCain is offering the same old gimmicks." "No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy" while Obama says "I start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal. I am not a nuclear energy proponent." The ad ends with the message: "Barack Obama Truly Is The Dr. No Of Energy Security." The ad is part of an effort by the McCain campaign to portray Obama as an obstructionist on energy policy. We were surprised to find the ad had a split personality. The drilling and gas tax claims were accurate, as we'll explain below. But we found McCain was Pants-on-Fire wrong with his claims about Obama's positions on innovation, the car and nuclear power. The drilling claim refers to Obama's response after McCain suggested on June 16, 2008, that states be given authority to decide whether to permit offshore drilling. Indeed, that day Obama's campaign said he was opposed, and on June 20 the candidate reiterated his opposition during a stop in Jacksonville, Fla. "I will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off Florida's coasts," Obama said in his prepared remarks for that appearance. He also said McCain was misleading voters by suggesting more drilling would lower gas prices, because it would take many years before a significant amount of oil was produced. The ad's claim about the gas tax holiday refers to Obama's response to another McCain proposal, to eliminate the federal tax on gasoline between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Obama has repeatedly said he opposes the idea because oil companies would not pass along the savings and, even if they did, it would provide relatively little help to consumers. (We checked Obama's claim that it would save a typical motorist about 30 cents a day and found it Mostly True. ) So on these points, McCain's right. Obama is opposed to changing the rules on offshore drilling and suspending the gas tax. McCain gets a True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-27T00:00:00	2008-06-25	['None']
pomt-13262	Sen. Johnny Isakson voted for a trade agreement, "with China costing Georgia 93,000 jobs."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2016/oct/15/jim-barksdale/barksdale-cherry-picks-numbers-attack-isakson-trad/	The latest polls indicate Democrat Jim Barksdale has an uphill battle against two-term incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson in Georgia. Barksdale, a multi-millionaire businessman, has pounced on an issue where he thinks Isakson is vulnerable -- trade agreements and their connection to lost jobs in the state. In his latest ad, he makes a statement about Isakson’s vote on Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China. In a recent campaign video, Barksdale said, "Johnny voted for PNTR with China costing Georgia 93,000 jobs." Isakson, who has been in Congress since 1999, faces Barksdale and Libertarian candidate Allen Buckley in the Nov. 8 general election. Did Isakson vote for legislation that cost the state jobs? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look into the statement. We reached out to the candidate’s camps for some background. Barksdale’s campaign spokesperson Gregory Minchak said the number comes from a 2014 Economic Policy Institute study that found millions of jobs were displaced after the agreement with China, including 93,700 in Georgia. For some perspective on the state’s relationship with China in recent years, Isakson’s spokesperson Marie Gordon pointed to a 2015 Georgia Department of Economic Development study that says the state’s exports to China totaled $2.6 billion, ranking 12th among Georgia’s top exporter nations. The state’s imports from China totaled $19.7 billion, making China 7th among Georgia’s top importer nations. It may be important to note Georgia has a Republican governor and legislature, and Gov. Nathan Deal has made multiple trips to the country as governor. Isakson’s campaign also referenced a Heritage Foundation study that says the U.S. economy added over 3 million net new jobs. Isakson’s record Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China have been in effect since 2000, when President Bill Clinton signed a bill normalizing relations into law. Trade conditions with China previously had to be renewed on an annual basis. Isakson was first elected as a representative to Congress in 1999. He voted for the bill to normalize trade with China in May 2000, and it was signed into law by Clinton in October 2000. Isakson is also in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement to reduce barriers to trade in Pacific Rim countries while curbing China’s influence in the area. The agreement still needs to be passed by Congress. Barksdale says later in the ad he will not vote for "bad" trade deals and is opposed to corporate tax breaks. Throughout the campaign, the investment manager has channeled the anti-establishment nature of Sen. Bernie Sanders more than that of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Isakson’s counterattack ads have called Barksdale a hypocrite, and said his fortune comes from companies that outsource jobs to China. Since then, the strongest effort to scale back trade with China came in 2005 (the year Isakson entered the Senate) when then-Rep. Sanders led an effort to repeal the bill due to jobs being lost overseas. The Math The 2014 study from the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute found "3.2 million jobs were lost or displaced" by trade with China between 2001 and 2013. Georgia lost 93,700 jobs, putting the state at number ten for jobs lost in the country. The report concludes, "Since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, the massive growth of trade between China and the United States has had a dramatic and negative effect on U.S." Experts say these are some of the most dismal jobs numbers cited in reference to trade with China. The U.S. International Trade Commission disputes the EPI’s methodology. Spokesperson Matthew McAlvanah said in an email, "up to half of all U.S. imports are intermediate goods that go into supporting U.S. production (and U.S. jobs). Many other imports are goods we do not produce at all in the United States, which have no impact on U.S. employment." In short, importing a good does not mean an American job is lost if the good cannot be grown or made in America. Some studies have found an increase in jobs since the bill’s passage. Most notably, the Heritage Foundation study citing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers refutes the idea that trade with China has led to job loss. It says, "from 1999 to 2011, the U.S. economy added over 3 million net new jobs." To figure out how these relations work, a 2011 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service sums the situation up well: "U.S. firms that use China as the final point of assembly for their products, or use Chinese-made inputs for production in the United States, are able to lower costs and become more globally competitive... On the other hand, many analysts argue that growing economic ties with China have exposed U.S. manufacturing firms to greater, and what is often perceived to be ‘unfair’ competition from low-cost Chinese firms. They argue that this has induced many U.S. production facilities to relocate to China, resulting in the loss of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs." Additionally, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has argued in favor of PNTR with China, saying it, "is vital to our national economic prosperity." Our ruling Barksdale said his opponent in Georgia’s U.S. Senate race voted for trade legislation "with China costing Georgia 93,000 jobs." Barksdale is correct that Isakson voted for the bill to normalize trade with China in 2000 and cites a 2014 number that said Georgia lost 93,700 jobs. One prominent study shows that. But other studies show the state actually gained jobs over the long run. Barksdale cherry picks his studies on this issue to make a point. We rate his claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e10d6d82-6c78-47e2-ad80-b53650258923	None	Jim Barksdale	None	None	None	2016-10-15T06:00:00	2016-09-29	['China', 'Georgia_(U.S._state)']
pomt-02522	The Keystone pipeline creates "35 permanent jobs" after construction, according to a government report.	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/10/van-jones/cnns-van-jones-says-keystone-pipeline-only-creates/	The debate over whether President Barack Obama should approve the Keystone XL pipeline often turns to jobs, but should it? Liberal CNN Crossfire host Van Jones says the pipeline is not the jobs creator supporters talk it up to be. "Every time we have a show, somebody says something ... about Keystone, and somehow Keystone is going to create all these jobs," Jones said in the Feb. 3 episode of Crossfire. "Then it turns out, look at the actual numbers. It turns out the actual numbers are 3,900 temporary jobs in the construction sector and 35 permanent jobs." Ralph Reed, a conservative activist who founded the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said Jones’ claim is unfair because a long-anticipated report by the U.S. State Department says the project will create 42,000 jobs. Reed went on to say the report cleared the main argument against the project, that it’s bad for the environment. We are fact-checking claims from each pundit about the project. Here, we’ll focus on Jones’ claim about the project creating "35 permanent jobs." The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would stretch 875 miles from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines and usher up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Because TransCanada’s project crosses international borders, the company had to file an application for a presidential permit. As part of the process, the president directs the Secretary of State to determine whether the project "serves the national interest." Secretary of State John Kerry has not yet issued a recommendation to Obama based on the study. Obama is under political pressure from all sides, with environmentalists and Democrats like Jones on one side who want him to shut it down and Republicans and some Democrats supportive of organized labor on the other who say it would strengthen the country’s energy independence and, yes, create jobs. When the State Department released its 11-volume report about the pipeline’s impact Jan. 31, 2014, the big headline in most news coverage centered on its finding that the pipeline project would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution. Some see that as giving Obama an opening for approval. With that backstory out of the way, let’s crack open the chapter on jobs. There’s plenty of debate over how many jobs the project would create during construction. The State Department report puts the total at 42,100 jobs, though the definition of a job in this sense is a position filled for one year. Much of the construction work would come in four- or or eight-month stretches. About 10,400 seasonal workers would be recruited for construction, the State Department said. When looked at as "an average annual job," it works out to about 3,900 jobs over one year of construction or 1,950 jobs each year for two years. The rest of the jobs would be the result of spillover spending (formally called indirect or induced economic activity) as Keystone workers buy equipment and materials to complete the project and spend their money on an array of services, including food, health care, and arts and entertainment. As you might expect, it’s much harder to measure the widespread effect on job creation. There’s no doubting that most of the economic activity comes during construction. Jones honed in on jobs after construction, which aren’t really a source of sharp debate. "There’s very few jobs operating pipelines," said Ian Goodman, president of the Goodman Group Ltd., an energy and economic consulting firm in Berkeley, Calif. "That’s one of the reasons why pipelines are attractive to the oil industry. They’re relatively inexpensive to build and operate." The report says the project would provide jobs for about 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors. The full-timers would be "required for annual operations, including routine inspections, maintenance and repair." Some would work in Canada. The U.S. employees would work at pump stations along the pipeline route as well as a Nebraska office. The project’s impact on housing, property taxes and service industries once in operation? Not much. Not much is known about the contractors’ workload except they would provide additional specialized support. Still, arguments about the relatively small number of permanent jobs from the pipeline often belie the nature of construction jobs, which are comprised of temporary projects by definition, said Matt Dempsey, a spokesman for a coalition of pro-Keystone groups known as Oil Sands Fact Check. "You build it, you move on," Dempsey said. Our ruling Jones said the Keystone pipeline will only result in 35 permanent jobs after construction. The numbers, as reported by the State Department, back him up, though that’s the nature of any big construction project, be it a highway or monument. Jones’ claim is True.

pomt-07462	"Hackers broke into Virginia's prescription-drug database (and) ... obtained more than 8.2 million patient records and a total of nearly 36 million prescriptions."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/18/rick-scott/rick-scott-cites-virginia-drug-database-failure-co/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott appeared before Congress on April 14, 2011, to testify about the state's problem fighting prescription drug abuse and the proliferation of so-called "pill mills." One way Florida is hoping to combat the over-prescribing of pain medications like oxycodone, Scott said, is by implementing a statewide drug database that will track prescriptions that pharmacists fill for patients. The hope is that law enforcement officials can spot doctors who are prescribing too many drugs, or patients who are hopping from doctor to doctor satisfy their fix. Scott initially opposed the database, saying he was concerned about the privacy rights of law-abiding patients -- and asked the Legislature to repeal a 2009 law that created the computer monitoring program. But his position put him at odds with leaders in the state Senate, whose support would have been required to nix the database. So the database is moving moving forward. In his testimony before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, Scott repeated concerns about the privacy issues in such a system. He then highlighted a story about Virginia's prescription drug database to help make his point. "As the database implementation moves forward, I must draw your attention to a serious risk that I believe databases like this pose to the privacy of individuals – most of whom are law-abiding individuals," Scott said, according to his prepared remarks. "As you know, in 2009 the Associated Press reported a massive privacy breach when hackers broke into Virginia’s prescription-drug database. They obtained more than 8.2 million patient records and a total of nearly 36 million prescriptions. "So, while the database in Florida is brought online, I continue working with my legislative partners to find solutions that protect patient privacy." We wanted to know if hackers did indeed break into Virginia's database, and if they obtained 8.2 million patient records. News of the break-in to the database first appeared on WikiLeaks, a website founded to publish classified, secret and otherwise private government information. On April 30, 2009, the WikiLeaks website reported that the Virginia Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) secure website was hijacked with a $10 million ransom demand. "In my possession, right now, are 8,257,378 patient records and a total of 35,548,087 prescriptions," the hacker wrote on the site. "For $10 million, I will gladly send along the password … If by the end of 7 days, you decide not to pony up, I'll go ahead and put this baby out on the market and accept the highest bid …" The FBI acknowledged in a May 5 Associated Press article that it was investigating a breach of the system, and in a subsequent article said that WikiLeaks reported that 8 million patient records and 35 million prescriptions were accessed. The WikiLeaks report contained the ransom note, but did not include the posting of any patient records, said Diane E. Powers, a spokeswoman with the Virginia Department of Health Professions. The following day, state officials confirmed that someone had hacked into the database. Virginia authorities said they would not pay the ransom. "They really think they'll get anything out of this?" said then-Gov. Timothy M. Kaine. "Not a chance." The ransom deadline came and went without noticeable incident, according to media accounts. And most importantly for our check, state officials said it was unclear whether the hackers were able to view patient records, as they had claimed. Powers told PolitiFact Florida that the investigation remains open. No one has been caught in connection with the virtual break-in. The Virginia Department of Health Professions did send a notification letter to all persons whose prescription records in the database contained a nine-digit number that could have been a Social Security number. None of the database information was lost, Powers said, and the PMP continues to operate. So a hacker did break into the database and posted a ransom note claiming to have obtained the records Scott referenced. But it's not clear whether the hacker really obtained access to the records. We rate Scott's claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-04-18T09:57:00	2011-04-14	['None']
pomt-14932	"I never said that" Marco Rubio was Mark Zuckerberg’s personal senator.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-didnt-realize-his-own-website-called-/	During the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colo., Donald Trump faced off with CNBC co-moderator Becky Quick over something Trump had supposedly said about one of Trump’s presidential rivals, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Here’s the exchange: Quick: "You have talked a little bit about Marco Rubio. I think you called him (Facebook founder) Mark Zuckerberg’s personal senator, because he was in favor of the H-1B visa." Trump: "I never said that. I never said that." Quick: "So this is an erroneous article the whole way around? … My apologies, I'm sorry." Trump: "Somebody's really doing some bad fact-checking." As it turns out, Quick was, uh, too quick to apologize. We looked at the immigration-policy page of Trump’s campaign website and found the following: "Here are some additional specific policy proposals for long-term reform: "Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program's lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities." And here’s a screenshot we took during the debate: Quick circled back later in the debate, noting that she got her information from Trump’s website. Trump did not offer a rebuttal. We did not receive an immediate response from the Trump camp. Our ruling In the debate, Trump said he "never said that" Marco Rubio was Mark Zuckerberg’s personal senator.

pomt-06705	Takes credit for "substantially reducing the size of the state workforce."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/sep/03/george-allen/allen-says-he-substantially-cut-state-government-w/	Republican George Allen is promising he’ll help stop the growth of the federal government if he’s elected to the U.S. Senate next year. He says he’ll bring to Washington the same kind of "sweeping reform" he brought to Virginia as governor from 1994 to 1998. His campaign website says that when Allen was governor, "He challenged critics and sentiment that suggested it couldn’t be done, reining in government spending and substantially reducing the size of the state workforce." In this fact check, we’ll look at Allen’s claim that he substantially cut the number of state employees. In the near future, we’ll examine the other assertion in his statement: That Allen "reined in" state spending. Allen, while campaigning for governor, often said Virginia’s bureaucracy was bloated and vowed to make deep job cuts. In his inaugural address, Allen proclaimed: "The will of the people has been frustrated by an unholy alliance of manipulative well-heeled interests, entrenched bureaucrats, and political opportunists. It is time for this to end." So did Allen reduce the employment rolls? Bill Riggs, spokesman for Allen’s senate campaign, pointed us to a Dec. 31, 1997, report from the state Department of Personnel & Training. It shows the number of full-time equivalent employees in the state’s executive branch -- under control of the governor -- was about 111,540 in December 1993, just before Allen took office. The number dropped to 101,450 in Allen’s last full month in December 1997. That’s a a decrease of 10,090 employees, or roughly 9 percent of the state workforce. Figures from the Virginia Department of Human Resource Management confirm the 9 percent drop in the state’s executive branch. When including employees in the legislative, judicial branches and at independent agencies -- such as the Virginia Lottery -- DHRM’s figures show the number of state employees went from about 115,750 in December 1993 to 110,250 in December 1997. That’s a drop of 5,500, or about 5 percent. But there is debate over whether the reduction of employees really streamlined government, because while Virginia was shedding workers under Allen, it was also increasing its use of private contractors. The centerpiece of Allen’s effort was a voluntary buyout for state workers created under the 1995 Workforce Transition Act. About 5,500 bureaucrats took advantage of the buyout, causing "the largest such exodus ever in Virginia," according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch article in 1997. The greatest impact was in the Virginia Department of Transportation. About 1,300 employees decided to take the buyout, roughly 10 percent of that agency’s workforce. The state budget had funds to pay 11,570 VDOT workers when Allen took office. The final budget Allen proposed, for the 1998-2000 biennium, paid for 10,262 employees. But just because people left their state job with a buyout didn’t mean they stopped working for Virginia. Some of them, as documented in news reports from the time, went to work for private firms that contracted with VDOT. Allen’s supporters and detractors traded barbs over the level of savings from the buyout program. Allen, in 1997, estimated the buyout saved $134 million a year. But critics said his figure ignored the costs of paying millions of dollars in overtime, contracting out work and hiring replacements. The Democratic-controlled House Appropriations Committee estimated that the savings might only amount to $13 million to $17 million in fiscal 1998. Allen’s defenders argued privatizing state functions streamlined government and was cost efficient. But a November 1998 report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that in least in one case, contracting out jobs cost more money. Outsourcing bridge inspections over the three previous fiscal years cost the state $4.7 million more than if it VDOT had used in-house staff, according to the report. A JLARC report showed that contracting increased during the Allen years, in part, due to the drop in staffing from the buyout. The number of VDOT projects that consultants worked on doubled from about 350 in fiscal year 1994 to 700 in fiscal year 1998. The value of outstanding VDOT consulting contracts also increased, going from about $300 million on January 1, 1994 to nearly $700 million on Janurary 1, 1998. In addition to the buyout, Allen also used a hiring freeze and attrition to lower the state workforce. Jobs related to health and public safety were exempt from the freeze. Gov. James Gilmore, a Republican who succeeded Allen, eased the hiring freeze shortly after taking office by allowing cabinet secretaries to set their agency employment levels, according to a July, 1998 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. That was a change from Allen’s practice of having staffing largely controlled by the Department of Planning and Budget, according to the article. In subsequent years, the number of state employees was on the rise, increasing to about 115,500 by June 30, 2000. To sum up: Allen says he substantially reduced the size of the state workforce. The number of state employees did indeed drop during his administration. In the executive branch, which represents the bulk of state workers, the number declined by 10,000, or 9 percent. It is important to note that as the number of state employees fell under Allen, Virginia’s reliance on private contractors rose. We can’t say how many of the departed bureaucrats went back to work for the state government -- albeit indirectly -- as private consultants. Those records don’t exist. So we struggle to call Allen’s reduction substantial. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2011-09-03T06:00:00	2011-08-22	['None']
pomt-13661	After initially agreeing with Republicans on an amount for Zika funding, "Democrats derailed it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/04/paul-ryan/ryan-blames-dems-zika-stalemate-omits-key-detail/	The latest poster child for gridlock in Washington is congress’ inability to pass a Zika funding bill. Florida has home-grown cases and has started aerial spraying. Meanwhile, a $1.1 billion aid package sits on ice. House Speaker Paul Ryan put the blame squarely on the shoulders of Democrats. In an USA Today op-ed, Ryan said his side compromised plenty to move the bill forward. The Senate passed a bill that called for $1.1 billion, all in "new" money, that is, not pulled from existing funds. The House wanted much less. When the two sides got together to resolve the differences, the House came up to the $1.1 billion mark and paid for it with a mix of new and existing money. "Unfortunately, when this plan went to the Senate for a vote, Democrats derailed it," Ryan wrote. "This was despite months of calling for action, and even voting in favor of that exact funding level just weeks prior. They blocked our plan not once, but twice — a blatant ploy in an election year. Because of their actions, this funding is in limbo." Ryan has the sequence of events right, but he leaves out one part. When House and Senate negotiators got together in their conference committee, Republicans added a clause to block any money going to an affiliate of Planned Parenthood in Puerto Rico. On the Senate floor in June, Florida Democrat Bill Nelson argued that this would limit access "to birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus and prevent terrible birth defects." He said the House measure was not "a serious solution." Without Democratic support, the bill never made it to a straight up or down vote. We previously fact-checked Nelson’s claim that the Planned Parenthood ban would limit access to care. Here’s a map of the clinics that would get money under the bill. While this shows a few areas without a clinic, it turns out the Planned Parenthood affiliate doesn’t fill any of those gaps. A public health researcher told us that Planned Parenthood reaches younger and poorer women, but on balance, we rated Nelson’s claim Half True. There would be some reduction in access, but not based on where women live. In theory, they could find care elsewhere in their community. So where does that leave us with Ryan’s claim? He is correct that Senate Democrats agreed to a $1.1 billion plan. But the bill they approved did not have the Planned Parenthood funding ban. To that extent, the bill they rejected was a different bill. Those differences were anti-abortion measures inserted by House Republicans. There were other changes, but the Planned Parenthood element was the one mentioned most often. Our ruling Ryan said Democrats blocked the Zika funding bill after agreeing on the dollar amount. That part is accurate, but the main reason Democrats gave for their action was the Republican addition of language that barred a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico from receiving government funds. Democrats could have chosen to accept that provision and passed the bill. On the other hand, Republicans could have chosen not to add it during the conference committee. It took two to tango. Accordingly, we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a3846eb7-58d6-406b-8b3e-648407f92f9e	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-08-04T17:59:02	2016-08-03	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-13962	"Nine million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine because of the work of the Clinton Foundation and my husband."	true	/global-news/statements/2016/jun/15/hillary-clinton/clinton-clinton-foundation-helped-9-million-lower-/	The Clinton Foundation might be committed to doing good around the world, but Hillary Clinton’s critics see it as a ripe target to bring down the presumptive Democratic nominee. Republican Donald Trump recently charged that some countries who gave money to the foundation received favorable treatment in return. For anyone who hasn’t heard about the Clinton Foundation, it’s the signature project to reduce poverty and improve global health created by former President Bill Clinton. It is part matchmaker, helping wealthy donors connect with doers, and part active participant, directly running programs, especially in health care. In an interview with Hillary Clinton, CNN’s Anderson Cooper quoted Trump and asked if her husband would break all ties with the foundation, should she become president. Clinton said she would cross that bridge "if we come to it," and proceeded to give a full-throated defense of the foundation. "I'm proud of the work that it has done," Clinton said in the June 8, 2016, interview. "Nine million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine because of the work of the Clinton Foundation and my husband. We have women across the country, from Latin America and Africa -- across the world, I mean -- getting good jobs, and being able to support themselves for the first time." We’ll focus on the first part of that statement and explore if the Clinton Foundation actually had a hand in making HIV/AIDS drugs more affordable for 9 million people? The foundation’s work on HIV/AIDS treatment dates back to 2002 with the creation of the Clinton Health Access Initiative. That was a time when some countries were paying $1,000 or more to treat each AIDS patient. The basic goal was to bring in bulk-buying to lower costs. The program consolidated both the supply of raw materials to make the drugs and the bidding to supply the finished product. The result was lower production costs and lower drug prices. Today, the initiative tracks the going price for a menu of treatments and posts them to help health departments around the world as they negotiate with drug companies. In 2014, the World Health Organization reported that by the end of 2013, more than 11.7 million people were on antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries. While the kinds of drugs have changed, the WHO said "in the past decade the price of individual antiretroviral formulations has decreased considerably." The treatments used in the early days have fallen from a median cost of about $600 in 2003 to about $100 a decade later. A more advanced drug combination introduced in 2005 saw a similar decline. Importantly, the WHO listed the Clinton Health Access Initiative as one of a handful of organizations collaborating on ensuring a steady supply of drugs. The partners in that effort include the biggest players, including several United Nations agencies, PEPFAR (the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and UNITAID, a project created by Brazil, Chile, France, Norway and the United Kingdom. UNAIDS announced at the end of May that the number of people under treatment is now closer to 17 million. Technically, the Clinton Health Access Initiative has been a separate nonprofit since 2010, but it is still integrated within the Clinton Foundation and the foundation press office still offers comments on its behalf. Clinton Health Access Initiative spokeswoman Maura Daley told us that Clinton used an old figure for the people being served by the initiative. "The total number of patients benefitting is 11.8 million," she told us. Not everyone getting treatment is counted as benefiting from the initiative’s efforts. Beyond working to reduce drug costs, it also coordinates with nongovernmental organizations inside countries to distribute the drugs once they arrive. Clearly, the Clinton Health Access Initiative did not accomplish all of this on its own, but Clinton didn’t say that. Two experts in HIV/AIDS treatment, Jennifer Kates at the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Ellen ‘t Hoen call the initiative an important player. ‘t Hoen was the first executive director of the Medicines Patent Pool, a group that streamlines the production of generic antiretroviral drugs. "Without the work of the MPP it would have been much harder for organizations like CHAI to access generic antiretrovirals," she said. The initiative has been faulted for failing to fully report donations from foreign governments and has filed amended returns for 2012 and 2013. Our ruling Clinton said 9 million people have lower-cost HIV/AIDS medicine thanks to the efforts of the Clinton Foundation and her husband. Bill Clinton started the foundation and its first big project was the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The program focused on using market mechanisms to reduce treatment costs. Costs have fallen dramatically and the initiative remains a key global player in maintaining a steady supply of affordable drugs. If anything, Clinton understated the number of people who have benefited from the program. We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/037cffe5-607a-4a13-9fe8-a78567e75857	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-06-15T10:00:00	2016-06-08	['Clinton_Foundation', 'HIV/AIDS']
pomt-00301	Says Beto O’Rourke described police as "modern-day Jim Crow."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/sep/25/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-simplifies-saying-beto-orourke-called-pol/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the Republican seeking a second term against Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, portrayed O'Rourke as wildly out of step with Texas in part, Cruz said, by standing against police officers who protect communities with their lives. Cruz offered as backup in the pair's Sept. 21, 2018, debate at Southern Methodist University a flawed charge that O’Rourke, who represents El Paso in the House, voted against body armor for sheriffs. That's False, we’ve ruled, in that there was no such vote. Cruz also said O'Rourke had said he’d be open to abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We've found that claim Mostly True though O’Rourke also has said he wouldn’t eliminate the agency without another department absorbing its duties. Cruz said next: "And just this week, Congressman O’Rourke described law enforcement, described police officers, as modern-day Jim Crow." Cruz called that descriptive--which refers to the post-Reconstruction practice of denying black Americans equal rights on all fronts--offensive. "That is not Texas," Cruz said. O’Rourke replied in the debate: "What Sen. Cruz said is simply untrue. I did not call police officers modern-day Jim Crow." So, did he? By email, Catherine Frazier of Cruz’s campaign told us Cruz was referring to O’Rourke’s reply to a question during a Sept. 19, 2018, event at Prairie View A&M University as recapped by the conservative Daily Caller. Frazier also noted a press release critical of O’Rourke’s characterization issued by the Texas Municipal Police Association. Facebook Live video To see all that O'Rourke said, we turned to the O’Rourke campaign’s Facebook Live video of the Prairie View event. About 58 minutes in, O’Rourke was asked a question we had trouble making out about how he’d address the needs of former slaves. In reply, O’Rourke referred to the discovery this year of dozens of unmarked graves in Texas’s Fort Bend County indicating, he said, that well after the Civil War, law officers would arrest African American residents for idling and petty crimes to fill out work crews for contractors, a notorious convict-leasing system, according to a Houston Chronicle news story. O’Rourke said such individuals were "people who became convicts solely by dint of the color of their skin," he said, under a system that was "radically unjust." O’Rourke went on: "That injustice, to many more people here that I know firsthand, continues to persist today. That system of suspending somebody, solely based on the color of their skin; searching that person solely based on the color of their skin; stopping that person solely based on the color of their skin; shooting that person solely based on the color of their skin; throwing the book at that person and letting them rot behind bars solely based on the color of their skin, is why some have called this, I think it is an apt description, the new Jim Crow." He said next: "We have written people off and written people out of the economic life of this country, their ability to participate in the future of the United States of America. We have literally drawn people out of their state House, their congressional, their state Senate districts solely based on the color of their skin." Some outside perspective: A 2010 book, "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness," includes a chapter in which author Michelle Alexander, of late an oped columnist for the New York Times, says the imprisonment of 1 million black American men can greatly be attributed to how police and the criminal justice system handle the pursuit, detention and prosecution of black men, many times for drug crimes oft ignored when committed by white people. It adds up to discrimination that’s perfectly legal, Alexander writes, because it’s based on a person’s criminal record. "In the system of mass incarceration," Alexander writes, "a wide variety of laws, institutions, and practices--ranging from racial profiling to biased sentencing policies, political disenfranchisement, and legalized employment discrimination--trap African Americans in a virtual (and literal) cage." O'Rourke camp disputes Cruz's claim Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign answered our inquiry with an email disputing Cruz’s conclusion that O’Rourke called law enforcement or police officers the new Jim Crow. Evans stressed that O’Rourke was speaking, as he said, to the "system." Evans wrote: "As Beto has done at many forums in the past, he outlined how institutionalized inequity -- in education, in economics, in health care, in the justice system, in housing, in transportation -- has been referred to as the New Jim Crow." Evans also pointed us to an August 2018 O’Rourke commentary published in the Chronicle. In it, O’Rourke describes his tour of the Harris County Jail, which he calls "part of the world’s largest prison population. One that is disproportionately comprised of people of color, though we know that people of all races use illegal drugs at roughly the same rate. Many have called this the New Jim Crow, and for good reason." In the commentary, O’Rourke goes on to talk about the share of black children with a parent in the U.S. criminal justice system and he says that such results begin with a "school-to-prison pipeline" starting as early as kindergarten, where a black child is far more likely than a white child to be suspended or expelled, he says. Evans further emailed us web links to fact-checks by NBC and the Associated Press of Cruz’s debate statement, each one stating the senator oversimplified what O’Rourke had said at the university. Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke described police as "modern-day Jim Crow." This claim has an element of truth in that O’Rourke’s embrace of the "new Jim Crow" description followed his excoriation of police stops, searches and shootings he attributed to the color of a person’s skin. But O’Rourke also said such actions rank among ways the country systematically discriminates against black residents--extending, he said, to sentencing, economic opportuniy and to how lawmakers carve districts.

pomt-12588	"75 percent of the town boards in Wisconsin have no women on them at all."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/07/erin-forrest/mostly-men-only-three-quarters-town-boards-wiscons/	How underrepresented are women in elected offices in Wisconsin? "Horrifyingly underrepresented," says Erin Forrest, executive director of Emerge Wisconsin, which helps Democratic women run for office. Forrest responded to the question on the April 2, 2017 edition of "Capital City Sunday," a public affairs program on Madison’s WKOW-TV. Then she made several statistical claims, including one with a huge figure: "Seventy-five percent of the town boards in Wisconsin," Forrest claimed, "have no women on them at all." Nearly one in every three Wisconsin residents live in what are largely rural towns. Are the town boards really so dominated by men? Candidates and the group The program began with an interview of state Sen. Leah Vukmir, a suburban Milwaukee Republican who is considering a run against first-term U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Madison Democrat, in 2018. Even with the election more than a year and a half away, Baldwin was hit a couple of weeks earlier with a Super PAC attack claiming she "supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops." Our rating was Mostly False, given that the measure would have been largely symbolic. To balance Vukmir’s appearance on the show, Forrest was interviewed. Emerge Wisconsin, which offers a six-month training program for Democratic women who want to run for office, reported that after the election of Donald Trump, it had its largest group of applicants. Now to Forrest’s claim. The numbers In Wisconsin, a town is the form of local government in areas that are not within the boundaries of cities or villages. About 30 percent of Wisconsin residents live in towns, according to the Wisconsin Towns Association. One of the state’s 1,255 towns, according to the Wisconsin Blue Book, is also a county -- Menominee. It has seven town board members (four women and three men), who also serve as county supervisors, while most town boards have only three members, each of whom are elected to two-year terms. To back her claim, Forrest referred us to a report released in April 2016 on women elected to judicial, executive and legislative offices in Wisconsin at the state and local government levels (including school districts). Current as of 2015, it is the latest edition of a report that is produced every five years by the Wisconsin Women’s Council, a state body whose members are appointed by the governor and legislative leaders. The data was collected by the Research Center for Women and Girls at Alverno College in Milwaukee. The report highlighted two findings in comparing 2015 to the first report, done in 2005: 23 percent of elected officials were women, up from 20 percent 3,100 women held elected office, up from 2,800 As for town boards, the report found, 75 percent of them had no women -- the same as in 2005. Town boards are the least likely among Wisconsin local governing bodies to have gender diversity, the study found. Women account for only 9 percent of town supervisors (the same as in 2010, but up from 7 percent in 2005). Women were most represented on tribal councils, holding 42 percent of the seats, the same as 2005, and on the state Supreme Court, holding five of the seven seats. Other perspectives Mike Koles, executive director of the Wisconsin Towns Association, said women are far more represented among town clerks and treasurers, the vast majority of which are elected positions. We looked for any other reports on elected women in Wisconsin, checking with the Wisconsin Towns Association, the Local Government Institute of Wisconsin, the University of Wisconsin Extension, Wisconsin Women in Government and the Wisconsin Federation of Republican Women, but didn’t find any that were aware of any other data on Wisconsin’s town boards. They don’t bear on this fact check, but we did find other studies that looked more generally at women elected officials in Wisconsin. State Legislature: 31 of the 132 members of the Wisconsin Legislature are women -- with that 23.5 percent slightly below the national rate of 24.8 percent, according to a February 2017 report by the non-profit National Conference of State Legislatures. County to federal: Wisconsin ranked 17th on a measure of representativeness that looked at race and gender among elected officials from the county to federal levels, according to a 2014 national report. It was commissioned by the Women Donors Network, which describes itself as a progressive group of women philanthropists. White women were 42 percent of Wisconsin’s population and comprised 22 percent of elected officials. For women of color, the percentages were 9 percent and 3 percent. Why they don’t run: Women expressed less confidence than men about their ability to run for and hold public office, according to a UW Extension survey of 600 county board supervisors and people identified as potential candidates for local office in 38 Wisconsin counties. The surveys were done in summer 2015 and the results were published in February 2016. Two of the findings: 71 percent of men compared to 60 percent of women said they were well-qualified to run; nearly 19 percent of women said "making decisions in public" acted as a barrier to running, while less than 5 percent of men felt that way. Our rating Forrest said: "75 percent of the town boards in Wisconsin have no women on them at all." She accurately quotes the most recent Alverno College study, in 2015, of elected women officials in Wisconsin. We rate the statement True.

pomt-14487	"You are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic, even if you have the same credentials."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-base-comparison-mortgage-rejection/	A reader recently asked us to fact-check something Hillary Clinton said about mortgage discrimination during a MSNBC-Telemundo town hall in Las Vegas on Feb. 18, 2016. The reader noted that, in addition to reaching a nationally televised audience, Clinton’s comment had been "going viral among real estate agents and lenders" after a YouTube commentator posted a video about it titled, "Hillary Lies about Mortgage Lending !!" The video has attracted more than 22,000 views. At the town hall, Clinton was responding to an audience member who asked how she planned to help Hispanics who want to buy or keep their house, particularly in Nevada, a state hit hard by the Great Recession. Among Clinton’s suggestions was to "provide more help so that more homeowners, Hispanic homeowners, African-American homeowners, those who want to have access to better credit, and better support. You know, credit has tightened up in ways that are just not fair. You are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic, even if you have the same credentials and you're presenting it to the people who are looking at it." Clinton was essentially saying that mortgage lenders were engaging in significant racial and ethnic discrimination that can’t be explained by other factors, such as income or credit history. That’s a serious allegation, so we decided to take a closer look. After checking with the Clinton campaign, we learned that she misspoke at the Las Vegas event. As evidence, they pointed to several other speeches in which Clinton had used a more accurate version of the statistic. For instance, after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 20, she said, "We see African-American families denied mortgages at nearly three times the rate of white families." She made similar comments at a Democratic dinner in Minnesota on Feb. 12 and interview with the BET network on Feb. 17. So where did these numbers come from? Studies released by the real estate website Zillow in February 2015 and November 2015. The Zillow study The study looked at federal data on mortgages. The 2013 data showed a denial rate for conventional loans of 10.4 percent for whites, 21.9 percent for Hispanics and 27.6 percent for African-Americans. The 2014 data showed somewhat lower denial rates across the board — 9.4 percent for whites, 18.8 percent for Hispanics, and 23.5 percent for African-Americans. These numbers pose a few problems with Clinton’s statement. For starters, these are denial rates, not acceptance rates, which was the metric Clinton used in her town hall comment. The acceptance rates for 2013 work out to 89.6 percent for whites, 78.1 percent for Hispanics and 72.4 percent for African-Americans, and using those numbers -- or the ones for 2014 -- her ratios don’t work. If you do use rejection rates, it was 2.7 times higher for African-Americans in 2013 and 2.1 times higher for Hispanics -- reasonably close to what Clinton said, though not a perfect fit. A bigger problem for Clinton, however, is that she said "even if you have the same credentials," even though this study did not equalize for income, credit history or other factors before calculating those percentages. Indeed, Zillow made a point of noting in the study of 2013 data that while the "playing field remains strikingly unequal" in mortgage loans by race and ethnicity, differences in loan denial rates stem at least in part from income and geographical disparities between the three groups. "The disparity in loan approvals is likely tied to a number of factors, including income," Zillow said. Specifically, wrote Zillow Chief Economist Stan Humphries, "black and Hispanic applicants for conventional home loans make roughly $20,000 less per year than white applicants, resulting in much higher denial rates. Similarly, black and Hispanic communities are clustered in areas that saw huge run-ups in home values prior to the recession, and even larger drops during the crash." Experts we contacted agreed with Zillow that differences by race and ethnicity can, and do, play a role in mortgage denials. Still, they said the scope of the racial and ethnic gap is hard to nail down, and is probably a lot lower than Clinton suggests. Andrew Hanson, a Marquette University economist, cautioned that income and credit scores are just two of the factors that could be contributing to the racial gap. Other, harder-to-quantify factors such as wealth and market experience can magnify existing biases as well. Hanson said he has conducted a smaller-scale study in which participants contact loan originators with basic inquiries. He then analyzed the loan originators’ offerings to measure any differences by race. The result? The size of the discrimination effect was about 2 percent. Hanson said there’s another caveat when gauging racial and ethnic discrimination: Much loan underwriting today is done electronically. "The deny-or-accept decision isn’t left up to a person these days," he said. "Information is basically given to a computer and the computer decides if the loan should be made. That is not to say that humans do not make decisions along the way, but a human rarely has the final say on loan approval/denial." Our ruling Clinton said, "You are three times more likely to be able to get a mortgage if you're a white applicant than if you're black or Hispanic, even if you have the same credentials." The Clinton campaign admits she misspoke. While there is evidence of disparities in mortgage acceptance rates by race, Clinton flubbed a talking point she has used correctly on other occasions. Experts say the gaps are not as drastic as Clinton says once you equalize for other key factors, such as income and credit history. We rate her statement False.

pomt-09662	"I have never voted for a tax increase."	false	/florida/statements/2009/nov/25/marco-rubio/battle-out-conservative-charlie-crist-marco-rubio-/	Marco Rubio is all of the sudden a darling of the American conservative movement in his U.S. Senate primary run against Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. Consider his bona fides: Rubio opposes publicly run health care and is against abortion. He has been highly critical of the president's $787 billion stimulus plan. He is open to expanding oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. He has been endorsed by Mike Huckabee and coverboy for the right-leaning National Review . To top it off, there's this: "I have never voted for a tax increase," Rubio says on his campaign Web site . "While I generally support tax cuts, I believe meaningful tax reform that simplifies our tax code, makes it easier to understand and is more fair to the taxpayer should be our ultimate goal." In almost nine years in the Florida House, the last two as speaker, Rubio was an outspoken critic of tax hikes. Rubio twice opposed a tax increase on cigarettes only to have the $1-per-pack hike signed into law by Crist after Rubio left office. And Rubio, along with Crist, led an effort in 2007 to lower property taxes. Rubio went as far as to propose eliminating property taxes on primary homes altogether, replacing them with a state sales tax increase. That measure ultimately failed, but the idea still won him style points. Grover Norquist, a national conservative figure and president of the anti-tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform, called Rubio the most pro-taxpayer legislative leader in the country. "Runaway property taxes threaten the standard of living of millions of homeowners and renters and the bottom lines of businesses big and small," Rubio said during the property tax debate of 2007. The rhetoric clearly is anti-tax. But does the voting record -- he said "never" -- always match? Rubio's tax record PolitiFact scoured Rubio's nine-year voting history as a member of the Florida House. We also looked through votes Rubio cast in his two years as a member of the West Miami City Commission. As a city commissioner, Rubio voted twice to raise property taxes. And in the Florida House, while he pushed to cut property taxes collected by local governments, he also repeatedly voted to force school districts statewide to collect more property taxes, his record shows. Here's how: As part of the state budget each year, lawmakers set an amount the state's 67 school districts are required to contribute to education funding. The amount is set as a dollar figure. The state Department of Education then takes that dollar figure and turns it into a corresponding property tax rate for each school district. The process is called the "required local effort." From 2000 to 2008 -- the years Rubio was in office -- the required local effort from Florida's school districts rose about 102 percent, from $4.08 billion to $8.25 billion. Rubio voted for the budget, and the schools tax, each year. Some of that increase was created by new construction, but at least $2.5 billion came in additional property tax payments made by Floridians. Two important caveats: • In 2008, the Rubio-led House originally passed a budget that did not raise the schools tax -- the increase came later during budget negotiations between the House and Senate. Rubio praised that year's final budget as being balanced "without raising taxes." • And in eight of Rubio's nine years, the corresponding tax rate went down. But because of increasing property values, the actual dollar amount -- the figure the Legislature sets -- grew. The best example of this comes in 2007. As Rubio, Crist and the Legislature were pushing to reform the state's property tax system, they also were passing a budget that increased school property tax collections about $340 million, excluding increases for new construction. In an interview with PolitiFact this week, Rubio offered two rebuttals: First, that he was only one member of the Legislature. And second, that he wasn't prepared to vote against the entire state budget only to make a point about the schools tax. Earlier this year, Rubio offered another explanation of his schools tax vote, saying that it wasn't a tax increase because the tax rate didn't go up. "Anybody who voted against those budgets, would have voted against massive tax cuts," Rubio said. "Somebody could have made that claim. That a 'no' vote on the budget was a vote against tax cuts." But in 2007, Rubio was given a proposal that would have allowed him to support the budget and prevent a school property tax increase. After Crist vetoed about $459.2 million from the 2007-2008 budget, then-House Democratic leader Dan Gelber wrote Rubio asking the Legislature to use that money to reduce the school property tax increase. Rubio balked, saying it would require a change to state spending practices. "I share your distaste for the property tax," Rubio wrote in a formal response. "In fact, I wish it would go away totally, at least on homesteaded properties. But as you know public education funding in Florida is a partnership between the state and local school boards. The property tax is the only method of generating revenue we have given school districts." Though he voted for the increases, Rubio did attempt to replace the required local effort with an increased sales tax in 2007 as speaker. The plan went nowhere in the Legislature, and a constitutional amendment for the tax swap plan was thrown off the ballot the following year by a Florida circuit court judge. State legislators aren't forced to hold public hearings and publicly acknowledge a tax increase like local governments. Some tax bills refer to the tax only as "School-state" or "School-state law." Other tax bills don't break the state tax out at all. It's a system, says state Rep. Adam Fetterman, D-Port St. Lucie, that helps perpetuate a belief that Tallahassee lawmakers aren't raising taxes, when they actually are. Fetterman authored a bill this year requiring tax collectors to tell residents if state legislators were raising school property taxes. The bill was never heard. "We had some folks in Tallahassee beating their chest, and nearly breaking their arms, shouting about the largest tax cut in Florida history," Fetterman said. "Then they turned around and forced local governments, specifically school boards, to increase taxes. I am tired and fed up -– as are most of my constituents -– of the saying of one thing and the doing of another thing in Tallahassee." Old city votes Rubio also voted in 1998 and 1999 for increases in property tax collections as a member of the West Miami City Commission, West Miami records show. PolitiFact tracked down the final budget resolutions for both years. Without getting too technical, they say the city of West Miami, without raising tax rates, was increasing property taxes -- 1.402 percent in 1998 and 5.545 percent in 1999. The roll call has then-Commissioner Rubio as voting "Y" both years. It's worth noting that Rubio later argued as a member of the Legislature that local governments were raising taxes while being able to claim they were keeping the tax rate the same. Rubio said this week it's a sign of a flawed system. Something he attempted to correct. "The essence of our campaign is that property taxes are an inherently unfair way to generate revenue," Rubio said. "There were very likely years that people were taxed more even though they were earning less." Back to Rubio's original statement. Though he claims to have never voted for a tax increase, we found that he has several times. First, as a commissioner in West Miami when he approved an increase in property tax collections, then as a state legislator when he voted year after year for budgets that forced school districts statewide to collect more property taxes. School districts were simply the middleman, in charge of collecting the money, but they did it at the behest of legislators. Maybe the votes could be considered appropriate. Or reasoned. Or even necessary. But they were votes to raise taxes -- and he did say "never." We rate his claim False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2009-11-25T17:54:47	2009-11-25	['None']

pomt-12554	The Keystone XL pipeline "doesn’t even have any oil for America."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2017/apr/16/kirsten-gillibrand/will-oil-keystone-xl-pipeline-stay-us/	President Trump’s approval of the Keystone XL pipeline brought protests from opponents who say it will not benefit the U.S. Every day the equivalent of 830,000 barrels of oil will flow through 1,200 miles of pipeline from Canada to Nebraska. "I’ve opposed the Keystone strategy for a long time because it is an export strategy," Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, told the Press-Republican newspaper in Plattsburgh. "It doesn’t even have any oil for America to make our gas prices cheaper." "It’s literally oil from Canada taken through America, so we take all the risks of any kind of spill or any kind of problem, and then it exports it to Mexico and then straight to China or other places," she said. PolitiFact rated a similar claim from then-President Obama Mostly False in 2014. We checked with a few experts to see if anything has changed. Is Gillibrand right? Will the crude oil that flows through the pipeline immediately leave the U.S.? What gets exported The Keystone XL pipeline will transport crude oil from Alberta, Canada to Nebraska. The oil will then flow through another pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries, where it will be refined into petroleum products like gasoline. Gulf Coast refineries export about two-thirds of their products, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration report in January. The rest is sold in the U.S. That is a marked shift since 2012, when refineries exported about 38 percent of their products. The Gulf Coast exports of crude oil -- oil that has not been refined into everything from butane to gasoline -- spiked during the same time period. Companies exported about 280,000 barrels of crude oil every day last year, compared to 4,000 in 2012. What gets imported The Gulf Coast imported more than 3.3 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2016. Most of that oil came from Latin America and the Middle East. Only 9 percent of the crude oil imported to the Gulf Coast came from Canada. The Keystone XL pipeline was designed to transport oil to the Gulf Coast because refineries in the region are already equipped to process heavier crude oils, like those found in Canada’s Alberta province. The same kind of crude oil comes to the region from Latin America. If the pipeline transfers as much crude oil to the Gulf Coast as the federal government expects, total imports would increase by about 25 percent. The State Department view The U.S. State Department did not respond to most of Gillibrand’s claim but did comment on how the pipeline could affect gas prices. "As the final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement makes clear, gas prices throughout the United States are primarily driven by global market factors," a spokesperson said. "The amount of Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) crude that makes its way to the Gulf region does not change this dynamic. Any impact on prices for refined petroleum products resulting from the approval and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline would be minimal." What experts say Gillibrand suggests the crude oil imported through the pipeline would be immediately exported to other countries once it reaches the Gulf Coast. Experts say that is not the case. "I don't believe that she is correct," said Mark Bateau, Director of the Energy Institute at the University of Michigan. "In general, refineries designed to handle heavier crudes are the ones most likely to utilize this oil, in some cases instead of heavy crudes imported from places like Venezuela." "I would say it doesn’t accurately describe the likely outcome," said Stanley Reynolds, an environmental economics expert from the University at Arizona. "It’s true that the oil would come from Canada and then mainly go to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining." TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, confirmed in an email that the pipeline was designed to reach refineries in the Gulf Coast region. Experts also say it’s unlikely that none of the refined products will be sold in the U.S. once the pipeline is built. "That refined oil product, gasoline or whatever, could be just as easily consumed in the United States as somewhere else," said Barry Rabe, an expert on environmental policy from the University at Michigan. "There’s nothing on the oil coming through a pipeline from Canada that requires all of that to be sold somewhere else." Our ruling Gillibrand said the Keystone XL pipeline "doesn’t even have any oil for America." Experts say the oil will not be exported straight to other countries, as Gillibrand said. It is true that exports of petroleum products from Gulf Coast refineries have increased considerably in recent years. That’s part of why PolitiFact rated a similar statement by Obama Mostly False in 2014. While the trend adds a grain of truth to her claim, it does not mean all of the oil that will come from the Keystone XL pipeline will be immediately exported. We rate Gillibrand’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-01255	Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/11/facebook-posts/congress-has-11-approval-ratings-96-incumbent-re-e/	It would be an understatement to say that voters in the recently completed midterm elections didn’t exactly feel warm and fuzzy about incumbents on the ballot this year -- even about the ones they voted for. According to the 2014 exit poll of voters, 59 percent of those who voted said they weren’t happy with Republican leadership in Congress, even as they were handing control of the Senate to the GOP. A meme making its way around social media, sent to PolitiFact by a reader, captured the frustration many Americans felt. The meme said, "11% approval ratings. 96.4% re-elected" -- in other words, Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected in 2014. The text was superimposed over a photograph of the House chamber in the Capitol. We wondered whether that was true, so we took a look. Does Congress have 11 percent approval ratings? While the meme features a picture of the House chamber, the most common polling question refers to Congress generally, rather than the House specifically, so we looked at Congress’ approval ratings overall. We found congressional approval scores from October 2014 from five different pollsters on the poll-archive website PollingReport.com: • Fox News: "Do you approve or disapprove of the job Congress is doing?" 13 percent said "approve." • CBS News: "Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?" 14 percent said "approve." • CNN/ORC: "Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?" 13 percent said "approve." • ABC News/Washington Post: "Do you approve or disapprove of the way the U.S. Congress is doing its job?" 20 percent said "approve." • NBC News/Wall Street Journal: "In general, do you approve or disapprove of the job that Congress is doing?" 12 percent said "approve." That averages out to 14 percent -- slightly higher than 11 percent, but in the same, miserable ballpark. Were 96.4 percent of congressional incumbents re-elected? To be consistent with the polling, which covers Congress broadly, we’ll lump together the incumbent winning percentages in both the House and Senate. There are a few contests still to be decided, but there are enough settled that we can make a pretty close count. In the House, we counted 390 incumbents who ran on Election Day. Of those, four haven’t had their races called as of Nov. 10, so we’ll set them aside. Of the remaining 386 incumbents, 373 won, for a winning percentage of 96.6 percent. If you add in three incumbents who ran but lost in primaries, the incumbent winning percentage drops to 95.9 percent. Meanwhile, in the Senate, 23 out of 26 incumbents won, with one more (Alaska’s Mark Begich, a Democrat) trailing in a race that has not yet been called, and another (Louisiana’s Mary Landrieu, also a Democrat) heading into a runoff. If you don’t include Begich and Landrieu, the combined House-Senate incumbent winning percentage is 95.4 percent. If you do include them, it falls slightly to 95 percent. All of these percentages are exceedingly close to the meme’s stated 96.4 percent, and they’re a moving target due to late-called races. So we won’t quibble. Our ruling The meme said that Congress has 11 percent approval ratings, yet 96.4 percent of incumbent lawmakers were re-elected. We found small differences in the actual percentages -- Congress had roughly a 14 percent approval rate, and the incumbent re-election rate may be as low as 95 percent -- but the point of the meme is solid. Voters hold Congress in low regard, yet they re-elect almost everyone. So we rate the claim True.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-11-11T16:56:06	2014-11-10	['United_States_Congress']

pomt-13955	"According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia law."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/16/donald-trump/trump-mostly-correct-about-sharia-law-support-afgh/	Donald Trump reinvigorated calls for a ban on Muslims entering the United States following the mass shooting of an Orlando nightclub by a U.S. citizen who pledged allegiance to ISIS during the fatal attack. Among his reasons, many Muslims support Sharia law —a set of religious principles that critics say include harsh punishments and can be used as a rationale for violence. Trump singled out Afghanistan to make his point in a speech June 13, 2016, in New Hampshire. "According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia law," Trump said. Is that number correct? What is Sharia law First, what is Sharia law? The Council on Foreign Relations offers a useful primer. Meaning "path" in Arabic, Sharia is largely derived from the Quran and is intended to guide various aspects of Muslim life. Sharia law has been incorporated in different ways, ranging from secular governments to fully Islamic governments. Many Republican presidential candidates have criticized Sharia law for its unequal treatment of women and after the Orlando attacks its views on homosexuality. They have also criticized the inclusion of Hudud punishments (ranging from stoning to execution) that are required for certain crimes such as adultery or theft. Scholars say that these punishments are not necessarily used in practice and that different countries interpret and apply Sharia law differently. Like other religions, personal interpretations are subject to change over time, said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Nai’im, a professor of law at Emory University. "Sharia is understood to be the religious obligations of Muslims, but it is a normative system in which Muslims have profound differences and always have," An-Nai’m said. Pew’s research Trump’s figure does come from a Pew Research study published in April 2013, titled "The World’s Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society." One clarification right of the bat — the Pew study found that 99 percent of Muslims in Afghanistan supported Sharia law as the "law of the land." Trump said people in Afghanistan. However, Pew also estimated in a 2012 study that Muslims made up 99 percent of the Afghanistan population, so that distinction does not invalidate Trump’s claim. Furthermore, Pew reported that their 2013 sample was representative of 94 percent of the Afghani adult population. A Pew spokeswoman said that Trump’s claim is "largely accurate." The "largely" qualification came because their study did not include the word "oppressive" like Trump did. Caveats Trump’s statistic is relatively solid, but the survey does shed some additional light on what the 99 percent figure means, and does not mean. The survey notes that, while overwhelming numbers of Afghani Muslims favored making Sharia law official, respondents were not unanimous on certain beliefs contained within Sharia law. Percentages are of Afghani Muslims. Violence 81 percent favored corporal punishment for crimes like theft; 79 percent favored a death penalty for leaving Islam; 58 percent think suicide bombing is rarely or never justified in the defense of Islam. Women’s rights 30 percent believe men and women should have equal inheritance rights; 37 percent believe it is "often justified" to kill a woman for dishonoring her family. Views on religious plurality 96 percent believe converting others to Islam is a religious duty. So people’s interpretation of Sharia law is not universal. Nor is it universal whom Sharia law should apply to. Nearly 40 percent of respondents, for instance, said that Sharia law should only apply to other Muslims, not non-Muslim citizens. Moving away from Afghanistan, it is also important to note that other Middle East countries yield different figures. Only 12 percent of Muslims in Turkey favor making Sharia law the "law of the land," for example, and only 66 percent of Muslims in Iraq think converting others to Islam is a religious duty. The Pew study Trump cites is also not the only study on the matter. A November 2015 study found that the majority of people in 10 countries with large Muslim populations viewed ISIS negatively (except Pakistan). The study did not include Afghanistan. Our ruling Arguing in favor of his proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, Trump said that a Pew Research Study had found "99 percent of the people in Afghanistan" support Sharia law. Pew said Trump’s contention was "largely accurate," noting that the phrase "oppressive" was Trump’s own. We did not take a stance on his use of the adjective. There is some nuance in the Afghanistan results, however, as Muslims surveyed have different perspectives on various aspects of Sharia law and how it ought to be implemented. And nearly 40 percent of respondents in Afghanistan said that Sharia law should only apply to other Muslims, not non-Muslim citizens.

And Democrat Bob Hackworth uses it to deliver punches to County Commissioner Susan Latvala, whom he is looking to unseat Nov. 2. His message: He knows how to better manage the county, and for proof, voters should look to how the county has fared under Latvala’s tenure. "I’m also struck by the irony that as we talk about jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, that the downsizing of Pinellas County government resulted in about 1,200 people being laid off in a 12 percent unemployment market," Hackworth told a crowd at a Dunedin candidate forum Sept. 14, 2010. "And so I think we have to be a little sensitive and we also have to be fiscally responsible and acknowledge that as you downsize and cut the cost of government there is a cost that you as the taxpayers bear to deal with that high unemployment number. … I can tell you that every one of them was hired from the time that Ms. Latvala went into office in 2000." Every single one? And 1,200 layoffs? We decided to see if voters should rely on Hackworth’s math. Hackworth said afterward he was referring to job losses in the years since the economy slid, starting in 2007. Since 2007, 465 county employees were laid off, according to records provided by county agencies. That count excludes people who received layoff notices but decided to retire instead, or people who wound up with a new county job as departures shook out. If you look at the number of people who actually received a layoff notice, the count is 799, still short of Hackworth’s 1,200. The next question was whether all the people who were laid off were hired under Latvala’s tenure. Her first meeting as a commissioner was Nov. 21, 2000. Using that timeline, only 341 people hired after that date were later subject to layoff. "It’s parsing," Hackworth responded, saying many more positions were cut. Here we’re checking two related statements from Hackworth: "The downsizing of Pinellas County government resulted in about 1,200 people being laid off in a 12 percent unemployment market. … I can tell you that every one of them was hired from the time that Ms. Latvala went into office in 2000." On that broader point, he’s right. The county government has eliminated 1,612 positions since 2007. But not all of those jobs involved layoffs, because some were vacant, and some involved retirements that were not filled, for example. But Hackworth said "layoffs,’’ and specifically of people hired during Latvala’s tenure, which numbered only 341. So we rate his claims False.

pomt-05949	Gov. McDonnell's proposed budget "is cutting" public education.	false	/virginia/statements/2012/jan/26/donald-mceachin/mceachin-says-gov-mcdonnells-budget-cuts-public-ed/	New dollars are scarce at the state capitol and politicians are positioning for a fight this winter over the amount of money that will be sent to public schools. Democrats are complaining that Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, stiffed education in a two-year state spending plan he submitted to the General Assembly last month. "Overall in this, his first budget, the governor is cutting pre-K and K-through-12 education by hundreds of millions of dollars," Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico, said Jan. 11 in the Democratic response to McDonnell’s State of the Commonwealth address. Is the governor really calling on lawmakers to reduce public school funding in the biennial budget that starts July 1? (We’ll explore McEachin’s claim that pre-kindergarten programs are also being cut at a later date). Let’s start with some basic math. McDonnell has asked the General Assembly to spend $13.1 billion on public education during the two-year budget cycle that begins July 1. The current biennial budget, which ends June 30, allots $12.6 billion to schools. So that leaves about a $500 million increase. McDonnell’s office says the exact increase is $497.2 million. How did McEachin conclude the governor is "cutting" public education? Our calls to him were referred to the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus. We spoke to two officials: Steve Pazmino, the executive director, and Katie Mulhall, the press secretary. They told us the bottom-line state budget numbers are misleading. What throws everything off, they said, is McDonnell’s proposal to inject a record $2.2 billion into the ailing state pension during the coming two-year budget cycle. Of that money, $600 million would go state workers’ retirement plan and Virginia government would pay for that. The remaining $1.6 billion would go to teacher pensions with localities kicking in $1 billion and the state paying $600 million. The state’s share would be a $342 million increase over what it is contributing to teacher pensions during the current two-year budget cycle. It would account for the lion’s share of McDonnell’s $497 million boost to the state’s biennial public education budget. So most of the new money the governor is seeking, as Pazmino and Mulhall point out, would be invested in pensions, not classrooms. Even so, there would remain $155 million in new state education money not earmarked for pensions. The bottom-line state allocation to schools, even if we don’t count the increased contribution to teacher pensions, would still go up under McDonnell’s plan. But these calculations, the Democratic officials told us, form the periphery of McEachin’s contention that the governor’s budget would cut school spending. Let’s go to the core. Funding public schools is a collaborative effort, with roughly 50 percent of the money coming from localities, 40 percent from the state, and 10 percent from the federal government. Pazmino told us McEachin based his statement on his belief that cash-strapped localities would be forced to slash their spending on classroom instruction to pay their $1 billion bill for teacher pensions over the next two budget years. Localities are paying a collective $472 million for teacher pensions during the current budget biennium, according to the Virginia Retirement System. "School boards all across the state are screaming and they’re not saying, ‘We’re getting more money,’" Pazmino said. "They’re all saying that this thing equals cuts." Pazmino sent us about a dozen news articles quoting local school officials across the state saying the pension contributions will create shortfalls in their budgets. The predictions came from educators in Virginia Beach, Lynchburg, Charlottesville, Waynesboro, Roanoke, Staunton and Suffolk. They said the slight increase in state funds their school systems might receive under McDonnell’s proposal would be dwarfed by increased pension payments. Several officials raised the possibility of teacher layoffs or tax increases to balance their budgets. Officials at the the Virginia Association of School Superintendents say they recently surveyed 85 of Virginia’s 132 local school divisions and found "more than 90 percent of them" were anticipating "significant shortfalls based on the governor’s budget." Locally, Hanover County public schools estimate McDonnell’s budget would increase its pension contribution by $5.8 million while adding only $1.6 million is state aid. Chesterfield County schools would see a $3.1 million rise in state aid while paying $16.7 million more for teacher pensions. Richmond schools estimate paying $8.2 million more in pension contributions next year and the loss of $985,300 in state aid. Henrico County, an anomaly in this debate, would pay $13.4 million more for pensions next year, but receive $14.1 million more in state aid. Our ruling: McEachin, speaking on behalf of Democrats in the General Assembly, accused the governor of "cutting" education funding in his proposed two-year state budget. The math doesn’t work for the Democrats here, as the net increase in state funding to public schools would be $497 million under McDonnell’s plan. McEachin and other Democrats point out that most of the money would go to teacher pensions, not classroom instruction. But even if you subtract the pension payments, McDonnell’s budget would increase state spending on public education by $155 million. That gain, Democrats speaking for McEachin argue, would be more than wiped out by new demands the governor’s budget would impose on local school districts. McDonnell’s plan would require city and county school systems to spend about $530 million more on teacher pensions during the next two years then they did in the past biennium. To comply, McEachin says localities would be forced to cut their education budgets. McEachin is mistaken. Teacher pensions are already part of local school budgets. Increased retirement payments would not cause the bottom lines of local education budgets to fall. To the contrary, each locality would have to decide how to pay for a rising expense. Democrats, speaking for McEachin, say the only realistic option for cities and counties would be to cut other education programs and many may go in that direction. But there are options: some municipalities could decide to raise taxes; others might opt to increase their school budgets by reducing spending for non-education services. No doubt, McDonnell’s budget would force most localities to adjust priorities. But it does not cut the overall state appropriation to public education nor the revenues localities use to pay their share for schools. We rate McEachin’s statement False.

"I'm very proud that while I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years," Cicilline said during his Oct. 16 debate against Republican Brendan Doherty, the former superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police. Cicilline talked about the crime statistics at least three times during the WPRI - Providence Journal faceoff. At the time PolitiFact Rhode Island first looked at the issue -- in 2010 when Cicilline first ran for Congress -- data were only available through 2009. We rated his statement as True because it was factually correct. Since then, PolitiFact national and its affiliates have begun looking at such statements with a focus on whether the implied cause and effect is fair and accurate. With that perspective, we decided to reexamine Cicilline’s claim and to include the statistics for 2010, Cicilline's last year as mayor. To recap, in 2010 we looked at data collected by the Providence Police Department on various crimes going back to 1960 and focused on the sum of all reports of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft, which the police call the "crime index." For 2009, the last year available at the time, there were 9,252 such crimes reported in Providence, according to police. That was the lowest number since 1965, 44 years earlier. Last week, we asked the Police Department for more recent figures. Meanwhile, we got Providence data from the FBI website. So we'll use that for now. There's one big caveat to this. The FBI and the city classify crimes a bit differently. As a result, in recent years Providence has invariably reported more crime incidents than the FBI lists on its website, even though Providence is the source of both numbers. In other words, the FBI numbers make Providence look better than the city's own numbers do. However, the trends are similar. The FBI numbers say the Providence crime index in 2009 was 9,173, or 79 fewer than the city reported. Going forward to 2010, the FBI says the number rose to 9,472, an increase of 299 incidents or 3.3 percent. However, Cicilline talked about "crime rate," which is the number of reported crimes for the population. Because Providence's population went up in 2010, the crime rate in 2010 was 53.2 incidents per 1,000 people, which is lower than the year before and the lowest of any year during the Cicilline administration. (We've put the FBI statistics on a spreadsheet that can be downloaded from www.scribd.com/politifactri.) When we received Providence police's updated data, we found that the statistics for the Cicilline administration had shifted, which can happen from year to year because categories can shift, such as when an assault becomes a murder. (In two of the years, the shifts were dramatic. The new numbers were 7.7 percent lower for 2005 and 4.2 percent lower for 2007. We asked for an explanation for the discrepancies, but haven’t received a response from the department.) But even with those numbers, the trend remains the same, with the crime index reaching a nadir in 2009 and the number of crimes rising a bit in 2010. Looking at the broader picture, Cicilline's comments at the Oct. 16 debate suggest that he and his administration were responsible for the decline, and it was clear from when we first did the story that officials think initiatives such as community policing played a role. However, the drop in overall Providence crime came at a time that crime was dropping nationally for a variety of reasons, including the aging of the population. Thus, the evidence is muddled. One thing that argues in Cicilline's favor is the fact that the decline in the Providence crime rate was steeper than the national decline during the early years of his administration. However, that decline seemed to have leveled off during his final three years in office. Our Ruling David Cicilline said that, "While I was mayor of the city of Providence we had the lowest crime rate in 30 years." That's actually an understatement. The 2009 rate was the lowest in Providence in four decades. The rate went down just a bit more in 2010 because a population increase in Providence washed out an increase in the actual number of reported crimes. The downward trend in Providence coincides with a national decline in the rate of serious crimes, but the decline in the early years of his administration was steeper than the national average. Cicilline and the Providence Police Department may have played a significant role in bringing the numbers down as well, but the scope of that effect is impossible to quantify with any certainty. Nonetheless, the evidence is strong enough for the judges to rate Cicilline's statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-03071	"Many state and federal agencies have such ‘navigators’ involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example -- even buying health insurance."	true	/florida/statements/2013/sep/30/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-florida-already-has-similar-navig/	Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., has a message for Republican Gov. Rick Scott who doesn’t want Obamacare "navigators" spreading the word about the health care law: Relax. We’ve had similar folks helping Floridians navigate health care programs for many years. Scott has sought to ban Obamacare navigators from county health departments and has faced some blowback: Broward and Pinellas counties have refused to comply and Miami-Dade may follow their lead. Nelson portrayed Scott as a hypocrite because he said there are already similar navigators who help Floridians with questions about health insurance. "State officials have so far failed to mention that these ‘consumer helpers’ have been serving the people of Florida in various ways for years -- and, yes, even with the current governor's full backing," Nelson wrote in a Tampa Bay Times op-ed Sept. 19. "In fact, many state and federal agencies have such ‘navigators’ involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example -- even buying health insurance. That’s right: even when buying health insurance created by the state. From Medicaid to Medicare, from veterans' organizations to the state's own KidCare insurance program, navigators are available to make sure Floridians get assistance." Are there already similar navigators who help the public access health insurance and other services? We went in search of the examples cited by Nelson. Obamacare navigators First, some background on Obamacare navigators. The Affordable Care Act awarded $8 million in federal grants to eight Florida entities to hire navigators, including the University of South Florida-based program Florida Covering Kids & Families and Pinellas County. Florida state leaders declined to set up their own marketplace or work with the federal government to run it together, leaving the job to the federal government. Navigators must go through at least 20 hours of training and be fingerprinted before they can become certified. Their job is to offer impartial information about health plans and the availability of tax credits and subsidies to offset the cost of a plan. They are not allowed to direct consumers to specific plans or receive payments from insurers, businesses or consumers. Navigators will begin enrolling people within days as the insurance marketplaces known as exchanges launch Oct. 1. Medicare/Medicaid counselors In our search for something similar to Obamacare navigators, we started with Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors, and Medicaid, which serves the poor. "The navigator program is similar to Medicare counselors, which have existed for years and never faced this kind of bullying from Florida," said U.S. Health and Human Services Department spokesman Fabien Levy. States receive federal grants to hire people that help Medicare beneficiaries enroll for coverage, and this year Florida received about $3 million. The Florida version of the program is called SHINE (Serving Health Insurance Needs of Elders) and is overseen by the Florida Department of Elder Affairs, which contracts with local Area Agency on Aging groups. Florida has 463 SHINE volunteers. SHINE volunteers aren’t involved in Obamacare and aren’t called navigators, said Ashley Marshall, spokeswoman for the state Department of Elder Affairs. But they fulfill a similar role in that they help guide Floridians who need insurance. SHINE volunteers assist seniors primarily with questions about Medicare, and sometimes Medicaid if a client qualifies for both. Outreach efforts include a helpline and spreading the word at community events. "What we provide is free unbiased information," said Charles Franckle, SHINE coordinator for Pinellas County. "When people are approaching Medicare they might contact us to ask us should they sign up for Part A and B and how do they do it." SHINE volunteers don’t endorse a particular plan. But they can answer questions about the differences between the various Medicare options by teaching the callers how to use the Medicare.gov website or doing it for them and sending them the results. Paid employees provide Medicaid counseling through the state Agency for Health Care Administration or contracted vendors. The counselors assist recipients via phone, in writing or in person and conduct community outreach and education. Florida KidCare insurance Florida’s KidCare health insurance program for poor children includes outreach to help families sign up for care. An outreach calendar for September showed various community events statewide where families could learn more about KidCare, such as at Pasco County’s Kids Health and Safety Day. In fact, KidCare even uses the term "navigators." A Nelson spokesman pointed to a 2012 sample contract that stated the Florida Healthy Kids Corp. was seeking grant proposals from "eligible organizations to become Regional Navigators and assist eligible families in applying for or retaining Florida KidCare." Three entities signed that contract: Health Council of Southeast Florida, Broward County Health Department and United Way of Marion County, according to the Florida Healthy Kids Corp. Legislative appropriations earmarked for Florida KidCare outreach were eliminated in July 2003, said Christie Goss, spokeswoman for Florida Healthy Kids Corp., a KidCare partner. But community groups statewide continue to promote KidCare and help the public enroll. Florida Healthy Kids provides some grants for KidCare promotion -- about $900,000 since 2011-12. The University of South Florida’s Covering Kids and Families, which received an Obamacare navigator grant, has been doing outreach for enrollment for KidCare and Medicaid since 1999 with state, federal and foundation grants. "We work with schools, churches, hospitals, businesses, etc.," said program director Jodi Ray. "We conduct our outreach and education activities wherever we have the best chance to reach people who need this information. We also have a military outreach project that specifically focuses on making sure that both active duty and veteran families get the information they need about getting their kids covered. The enrollment assistance is an important component of the outreach efforts." The particular requirements and training for Obamacare navigators and those who assist Floridians with KidCare or Medicaid can vary. However, "it’s very similar in that we are helping people apply for health coverage," Ray said. "We are not collecting medical health information -- we are simply helping them understand how to navigate the process without getting overwhelmed or confused and be able to answer questions so they can make decisions they need to make." Veterans The Florida Department of Veterans Affairs provides benefits counseling related to state and federal veterans’ programs. The department has paid claims examiners who work out of VA medical centers, clinics and nursing homes and provide benefits counseling to help connect Floridians to benefits such as disability payments and pensions. The counselors don’t enroll veterans in health care but do point them in the right direction. Scott’s response We sent Nelson’s claim and a summary of our findings of positions similar to Obamacare navigators to Scott’s office and received a short reply: "How many of those ‘navigators’ use the federal data hub?" said spokeswoman Melissa Sellers in an email. But spokespersons for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told us that navigators can’t access the "hub", which provides a way to transmit data between state and federal systems to verify consumer application information. "Navigators won’t be tied into the federal data hub. They will enroll people through the online interface that all consumers have access to at healthcare.gov," said Brian Cook, a CMS spokesman. We heard other comments from state agency spokespersons about differences in the training or requirements for Obamacare navigators compared to other types of benefits counselors. But Nelson didn’t make a claim about background checks or other requirements. Our ruling Seeking to assuage concerns about Obamacare navigators, Nelson said, "Many state and federal agencies have such ‘navigators’ involved in helping folks maneuver through the often complex processes associated with filing benefits claims, for example - even buying health insurance." Let’s review our findings: SHINE volunteers help seniors with questions about Medicare. State Medicaid counselors assist the poor who use that health insurance program. KidCare navigators provide information about that state health insurance program for poor children. The state veterans’ affairs provides benefits counseling. There are differences in terms of some of the requirements and training to become an Obamacare navigator versus those who provide assistance for some of these other programs. However Nelson didn’t say they are identical: He said that we already have such ‘navigators’ to help Floridians access services. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04410	Says Obama broke his promise to offer a comprehensive immigration bill in his first year.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/16/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-failed-offer-immigration-bill-he/	In the second presidential debate, Mitt Romney focused on the commitments that President Obama failed to deliver on. In that list, he included immigration reform. Romney reminded the audience of what Obama had promised. "He said in his first year he'd put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges," Romney said. "Didn't even file it."" This is one of the promises we’ve tracked in the Obamameter, and Romney is correct. During the 2008 campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. "I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days," Obama said. "But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible." In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated "that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting." But the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill. Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework "to fix our broken immigration system." That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the president called a "a very important step." Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. "In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we’ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken," said Obama. Obama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills. Our ruling Romney said that Obama promised to introduce a comprehensive immigration bill but never did. Obama did make the promise in 2008 and while he talked about moving forward, he did not. We rate the statement True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-16T22:44:14	2012-10-16	['None']
pomt-00182	Says Dean Heller "broke that promise" to protect expanded Medicaid.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/19/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/did-nevadas-dean-heller-break-his-promise-protect-/	Democrats have been dogging Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller ever since he sided with his party on a couple of key health care votes last year. The latest attack comes from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in an ad airing statewide in heavy rotation. In it, young Army veteran Kyle Rhodes tells his story. "I served in Iraq, but when I got home, I couldn’t afford health insurance," Rhodes says. "I finally got it when they expanded Medicaid. That helped a lot of us. "I believed Dean Heller when he promised to protect our health care, but Dean Heller broke that promise." Rhodes ends with these uncompromising words: "Dean Heller, you voted against us. Now it’s our turn to vote against you." Medicaid expansion covered nearly 9,000 veterans in Nevada in 2015, so the story Rhodes tells is not unique to him. Heller’s moves during the Senate’s push to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2017 play a prominent role in the Nevada Senate race. The charge that he broke a promise shows up repeatedly in Democratic ads. In this fact-check, we look at what Heller said and did between June and September of 2017. The pivotal news conference By June 22, 2017, the House had passed the American Health Care Act and the Senate had a draft of its replacement for Obamacare, the Better Care Reconciliation Act. The next day, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Heller held a joint news conference to protest the Senate bill. Heller said the Affordable Care Act had many problems, but "this bill is simply not the answer." "I’m announcing today that in this form, I will not support it," Heller said, waving a copy of the 167-page draft. "Our first vote on this piece of legislation may be as early as Tuesday. We'll have a procedural motion, that we don't need to get into, but it's called getting on a bill so that we can have a final vote sometime on Friday. I'm just telling you this, if this is the bill, if this is the language on that procedural motion on Tuesday, I won't be voting for it." Tuck that away: Heller said he wouldn’t even vote on the procedural motion for the bill "as written." Which brings us to the biggest problem in that version of the bill for both Heller and Sandoval –– Medicaid. Heller vowed to protect expanded Medicaid. Here’s what he said: "If you want my support on legislation on health care that fixes the state of Nevada, that supports these people that are on expanded Medicaid, you’ve got to make sure that the Republican governors that have expanded this Medicaid sign off on it. The question is, what are the changes in here and what are the assurances that they will have insurance in the future. And I’m telling you right now, it doesn’t do that. It doesn’t protect Nevadans on Medicaid and the most vulnerable Nevadans." The threat to Medicaid expansion Under the Affordable Care Act, states got the option to extend Medicaid to any adult earning up to 138 percent of federal poverty. Nevada was one of 16 states with Republican governors that took Washington’s offer. The terms were better than for traditional Medicaid. Instead of Washington covering a little more than half of the cost (the average in 2012 was 57 percent), Washington promised to cover 90 percent of the tab for Medicaid expansion recipients over the long haul. The Senate plan changed that. It phased out the enhanced federal matching funds for the Medicaid expansion group and set a limit on federal funding through a per capita cap or, optionally, through a block grant for some enrollees. For Nevada, those changes meant an estimated loss of $4.2 billion over 10 years. Pressure on a key vote The procedural vote that Heller expected quickly didn’t come for a month. In between, lawmakers tweaked the bill, but never fundamentally changed the funding rules for expanded Medicaid. Sandoval became a barometer of how well the Senate bill treated Medicaid. He never liked what he saw. Throughout the process, Sandoval remained opposed, saying he had "great concern" for what the legislation –– in all of its versions –– would do. After that news conference with Sandoval, Heller was in the crosshairs of everyone who wanted to get a bill through the Senate. Heller found himself on the receiving end of attack ads from a Trump-aligned super PAC America First Policies. Heller was invited to the White House where he was seated next to President Donald Trump. Trump pointed to Heller and said "This is the one we were worried about. You weren’t there (on the bill.) But you’re going to be." Trump turned to the rest of the room and added, "Look, he wants to remain a senator, doesn’t he?" On July 25, Heller voted with 49 other Republicans to move the bill forward in the Senate. It was the procedural vote he had said he wouldn’t approve. Heller spokeswoman Megan Taylor said by that time, the measure had changed and he saw that vote as the best way to improve the bill. "After it was clear that the bill was being modified and there would be an open debate and votes on amendments to the Senate’s bill, Sen. Heller voted to debate health care because he thought that ideas to improve our failing health care system should be discussed," Taylor said. But in terms of a threat to expanded Medicaid, the bill Heller green-lighted was largely the same as the version he rejected a month earlier. A mixed voting record The welter of Senate votes that followed make the head spin, and through it all, Heller managed to be on both sides of the Medicaid issue. He voted against a Democratic move that would have protected benefits to anyone currently eligible for Medicaid. He voted for a motion that effectively killed the main Republican bill and its whittling away of expanded Medicaid. Heller offered a non-binding amendment that urged Senate members in a hoped-for conference committee to protect Medicaid expansion. The amendment also called for repeal of the Affordable Care Act and lost by a wide margin. He voted against the full repeal of Obamacare, which would have washed away everything, including expanded Medicaid. Few people followed the twists and turns more than Timothy Jost, professor emeritus at Washington and Lee University School of Law. Jost told us Heller’s record was decidedly mixed. "He voted with the Republicans a number of times to proceed and on motions that kept the bill alive," Jost said. "But he did vote against two bills that would have killed Medicaid expansion." Jost said he sees evidence for both sides of the argument on where Heller stood. In the end, the Senate plan crumbled. In a dramatic 1 a.m. vote, every Democrat and three Republican senators, including most notably John McCain, voted against it and the bill died. That version was stripped down and said nothing about Medicaid. Heller joined most Republicans and voted for it. The final effort In September, Heller joined a last-ditch push to pass a new health care law. He co-sponsored the Graham-Cassidy bill. That would have replaced expanded Medicaid with block grants to the states. It shifted traditional Medicaid funding from an open-ended commitment to a capped amount. Nevada would have the flexibility to use its block-grant money however it saw best to help subsidize health insurance premiums, create high-risk pools for those with pre-existing conditions or take other steps as necessary to make health insurance affordable and available. The impact on the people benefiting from Medicaid expansion was unclear, but the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that overall, Nevada would lose about 8 percent or $870 million by 2026. Sandoval joined nine other governors to oppose Graham-Cassidy. The plan never came up for a vote. Our ruling The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Heller broke his promise to protect expanded Medicaid. Heller said he would vote no on a procedural vote, and said any bill must pass muster with Republican governors in states with expanded Medicaid. His follow-up votes were mixed. Heller voted yes on the procedural vote. While the bill differed from the original draft, it had no significant differences on Medicaid expansion. Immediately after that, Heller both voted no on a move that explicitly protected expanded Medicaid and voted no on two bills that would have killed expanded Medicaid. Heller co-sponsored the Graham-Cassidy bill, which did not specifically curtail Medicaid expansion but reduced funds going to Nevada and created uncertainty about the program’s future. He had said he would not support health care changes that did not win Gov. Sandoval’s support, but Sandoval opposed Graham-Cassidy. His record can make the case either way.

pomt-13442	On whether Barack Obama was born in the United States.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/16/donald-trump/full-flop-donald-trump-abandons-barack-obama-birth/	Donald Trump, who led a years-long movement to prove President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and thus ineligible to be president, abandoned that position in a speech in Washington Sept. 16, 2016. "Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy," Trump said. "I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean. President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again." At PolitiFact, our Flip-O-Meter judges whether someone has been consistent on an issue. The rating is not making a value judgment. Indeed, voters often like politicians who are flexible and have the ability to compromise or adapt their positions to the wishes of constituents. Still, accusations of shifting positions are so common in politics that it is valuable to have us provide an analysis of a shift and rate the amount of change. Trump previously took credit for Obama releasing his long-form birth certificate and pledged to donate $5 million to charity if Obama released his passport records. "A book publisher came out three days ago and said that in his written synopsis of his book, he said he was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia. His mother never spent a day in the hospital," Trump said in 2012. "His grandmother in Kenya said, 'Oh no, he was born in Kenya and I was there and I witnessed the birth.' Now, she's on tape and I think that tape's going to be produced fairly soon ...The grandmother in Kenya is on record saying he was born in Kenya," Trump said, incorrectly, in 2011. Trump made an identical false claim in a 2011 Today show interview: "His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth, okay?" In 2015, he dodged a question of where Obama was born in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. When Cooper asked directly if Trump believed Obama was born in the United States, Trump responded, "I don't know." "I really don't know. I mean, I don't know why he wouldn't release his records. But you know, honestly, I don't want to get in it," Trump said. "I don’t talk about that anymore," Trump told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews in December 2015. He said "he didn’t want to answer the question." As recently as Sept. 15, 2016, Trump would not acknowledge Obama’s birthplace, declining to address the matter when asked by the Washington Post, according to the Associated Press. "I’ll answer that question at the right time," Trump said. "I just don’t want to answer it yet." He talked more about it on Sept. 16, 2016, switching his long-held position.

pomt-04020	In 2009, the FBI "referred more than 71,000" cases of people failing background checks when trying to buy a gun to another federal agency, "but U.S. attorneys ultimately prosecuted only 77 of them."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/03/mayors-against-illegal-guns/us-files-criminal-charges-fraction-gun-denial-case/	Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which has intensified its efforts since mass shootings spiked in 2012, claims the U.S. rarely prosecutes felons and others who can't legally own a gun but are caught trying to buy one. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is among the founding members of the group, which aired a TV ad in Milwaukee and other cities in January 2013 as part of its campaign to spur action by President Barack Obama and Congress. The group supports measures such as requiring every gun buyer to pass a criminal background check. Regarding the prosecutions, Mayors Against Illegal Guns stated on its DemandaPlan.org website: "It is a federal crime for felons and other prohibited gun purchasers to attempt to buy a gun. The (U.S.) Department of Justice, however, has not been prosecuting people who fail background checks at licensed gun dealers, leaving them free to buy from unlicensed sellers who don’t conduct checks – including largely anonymous Internet sales." The statement continued with a reference to one Department of Justice agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF), claiming: "In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation referred more than 71,000 such cases to ATF, but U.S. attorneys ultimately prosecuted only 77 of them." Let’s look into the disparity. Gun background checks When asked for backup, Erika Soto Lamb, spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, cited a 2011 report that was funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and produced by the Regional Justice Information Service in St. Louis, Mo. The quasi-government agency’s report explains criminal background checks and gives statistics about attempted gun purchases in 2009 that were denied as a result of background check provisions in the federal Brady Act. The Brady Act was adopted in 1993, 12 years after President Ronald Reagan; his press secretary, James Brady; and two law enforcement officers were shot and wounded in John Hinckley Jr.’s assassination attempt on Reagan. The law requires a criminal history background check be done by the FBI or a state agency on persons who attempt to purchase a firearm from a licensed dealer. If the potential buyer fails the check, the gun sale is denied and the case is referred to the ATF. Prosecutions In 2009, the FBI conducted more than 6 million background checks and denied 71,010 of them (1.1 percent). The most common reasons were the applicant had a felony conviction or indictment, had a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction or was under a domestic violence restraining order. So, Mayors Against Illegal Guns is correct on the first number it cited. But that doesn’t means a crime occurred in all 71,000 cases. Jennifer Karberg of the St. Louis research organization that did the report told us that if a person trying to buy a gun indicates on the application form that, for example, he is a felon, the application will simply be denied. On the other hand, if a felon lied on the form about his conviction, that’s a crime that could be prosecuted, she said. Moreover, after further review, about one-fourth of the applications that are denied by the FBI are reversed after a determination that no denial should have been done, Karberg said. So those cases also don’t involve a crime. Of the more than 71,000 cases that were referred to ATF, the agency sent only 4,700 cases to its offices around the country for further investigation, according to the report by the St. Louis research organization. The rest of the denials did not meet guidelines for further investigation, or they were overturned after being reviewed. Of the 4,700 cases that went on to ATF field offices, the vast majority were not referred to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges, the report says. The most common reasons were "no prosecutive merit," federal or state guidelines weren’t met, or the applicant should not have been denied in the first place. Ultimately, the field offices asked U.S. attorney’s offices (there are two in Wisconsin) to file a total of 140 criminal charges. From there, only 77 charges were filed. The most common charges were submitting false information on the gun purchase application or being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. Karberg told us the 77 charges likely involved fewer than 77 individual cases, given that multiple charges could be filed in some cases. The author of the report, Ronald Frandsen, indicated to The Washington Post Fact Checker that the low rate of prosecution is the result of the priority given to such cases. And the Fact Checker said there is a troubling lack of detailed data that might clarify why few cases were referred for prosecution. Mayors Against Illegal Guns argues that more cases could be prosecuted. The group cited a 2004 Department of Justice review of enforcement of the Brady Act. The report found that ATF was referring "standard denial" cases to its field offices that "were not likely to be prosecuted." But it also said that historically, federal prosecutors "have been unsuccessful in achieving convictions in many of these cases and consequently have been unwilling to expend their limited resources on prosecuting" them. The report went on to explain why prosecutors may not want to file charges in certain cases: A person prohibited from buying a gun may have committed a felony that was not violent or was committed many years ago; a prohibited person might be trying to buy a hunting rifle; and it’s difficult to prove that the prohibited person was aware of the prohibition and intentionally lied on his application. So, there are indications that federal law enforcement authorities could file more criminal charges in cases in which a gun purchase application is denied. But it’s also clear that large numbers of the denials don’t involve any crime at all and some cases are not provable. Our rating Mayors Against Illegal Guns said that in 2009, the FBI "referred more than 71,000" cases of people failing background checks when trying to buy a gun to another federal agency, "but U.S. attorneys ultimately prosecuted only 77 of them." The two numbers are essentially correct, but the statement takes things out of context in that, in a significant number of cases, no crime was committed and other cases are not provable.

pomt-05219	On opposing any and all efforts to increase taxes.	full flop	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/08/nathan-deal/deals-support-t-splost-veers-tax-pledge/	A political litmus test is causing trouble for some of Georgia’s most powerful elected officials. Gov. Nathan Deal and other top Republicans have faced criticism for endorsing a proposed 1 percent sales tax to fund 157 transportation projects across the Atlanta region. The overall price tag is in the billions. A voter referendum on the tax will be held July 31. Blasphemy, the critics say. You promised not to support any tax increases, they’ve complained to Republican lawmakers who have spoken in favor of the referendum. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the lawmakers have indeed reversed course -- particularly since some facing the criticism signed a specific pledge to oppose any tax increases. The lawmakers and their spokesmen said no. PolitiFact Georgia began a search for clarity. The Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform has become a major player in Republican Party politics with its Taxpayer Protection Pledge. More than half the members of the U.S. House of Representatives have signed the pledge. Nearly half the U.S. Senate has signed it. Nearly all the signers are Republicans. Both U.S. senators from Georgia (Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson) have signed the pledge, along with GOP House members Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey, Tom Graves, Jack Kingston, Tom Price, Austin Scott and Lynn Westmoreland. More than 50 members of the Georgia Legislature have signed the pledge. So, too, has Deal, who signed it May 10, 2010, during his campaign for governor. A couple of Democrats in the Georgia House of Representatives are listed on the pledge list. ATR believes any new legislation or changes to an existing tax structure that results in a new tax increase on individuals is a violation of the pledge by lawmakers who have signed it. Some Democrats blamed ATR President Grover Norquist for last year’s failure by Congress to agree on a long-term debt deal. In recent weeks, some GOP lawmakers have done the unthinkable -- taken on Norquist in the media. They have complained the pledge doesn’t offer enough flexibility to handle the federal government’s financial challenges. But those are federal issues. Here, we are concerned with a local penny sales tax increase that would raise a lot of money for transportation projects. The proposed Georgia sales tax would raise about $7 billion over the next 10 years, planners have said. We asked Norquist whether Georgia lawmakers who’ve spoken in favor of the referendum have violated the pledge they’ve signed. "It does violate the pledge," he said. "It’s a rather significant tax increase." The language in the pledge is different for federal and state officials. The federal pledge asks signers to oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal tax rate on individuals and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions or tax credits "unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing taxes." The state pledge is less detailed, simply stating that the signer "will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." Although some federal lawmakers from Georgia such as Chambliss and Westmoreland have spoken in favor of the referendum, PolitiFact Georgia decided to focus more on state leaders since the sales tax does not fit the description of what constitutes a violation of the federal no-tax pledge. The 1 percent sales tax, also known as T-SPLOST, has the support of some commuters eager for any improvements to shorten travel time. Some proponents also argue the projects will help the region’s economy by hiring people to work on the proposed jobs. Some opponents argue that the project list will not do enough to improve commuting in metro Atlanta. Some say it will not get enough motorists out of their cars and into mass transit. Others are skeptical that the plan will be carried out as stated by regional leaders. Deal’s name was atop a flier for a May 23 fundraiser in support of T-SPLOST held at the home of former Cousins Properties CEO Tom Bell in Buckhead. The governor said it is important to attract companies to the state. Deal has spoken in support of the referendum to several large audiences in recent months, such as at the Atlanta Press Club, at an event in Savannah and to the Greater North Fulton Chamber of Commerce. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said it’s unfair to say the governor has flip-flopped on his commitment not to support a tax increase. Robinson said the referendum was approved before Deal took office. "This is not a violation of the pledge. [Nathan Deal] has cut taxes. This passed before he was governor. He is advocating for Georgians to approve it, not imposing it on them," Robinson said via email. Robinson added: "Governor Deal didn’t father this baby." Robinson said the T-SPLOST is in line with conservative principles such as consumption-based taxes. He also said the proposed penny tax is "the best program" to help reduce the region’s gridlock problems. "The fact is Grover Norquist doesn’t have to commute in Atlanta," Robinson said. Norquist said if state leaders feel compelled to spend more on transportation, they should spend less in other areas. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle isn’t on the list of people who’ve signed the pledge, but he’s taken heat for his support of the referendum. Cagle spokesman Ben Fry made an argument similar to Robinson’s that a referendum is different than state lawmakers imposing new taxes. "In the end, Casey Cagle has as much say as any Georgia voter," Fry said. Some state lawmakers who signed the pledge and made statements that suggest they support the referendum didn’t respond when we called. Others, such as Amos Amerson, leaving the House of Representatives after 12 years, said he decided the pledge isn’t always practical and asked in a 2002 letter to be removed from the list when he heard talk about raising the cigarette tax to help fund skyrocketing state health care costs. Amerson said he never received an answer to his request. As for his support of T-SPLOST, Amerson said: "Georgia has to do something for road improvements. We just do not have the money." There’s a good debate to be had about the issue of transportation spending. The problem for lawmakers who signed the pledge is it specifically states "that I will oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." The T-SPLOST is an increase in the sales tax. There are no cuts to make it revenue-neutral. Deal gets a Full Flop.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2012-06-08T06:00:00	2010-05-10	['None']

pomt-05631	Says former U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter refused to host town hall meetings during her time in Congress.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/mar/23/new-hampshire-republican-party/nh-republicans-say-shea-porter-ducked-town-hall-me/	Town hall-style meetings have a deep history in New Hampshire politics. But some state analysts fear the tradition of skipping these meetings is growing among lawmakers. In a statement released earlier this month, the N.H. Republican Party took aim at congressional candidate and former Democratic U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, criticizing her record of hosting Town Hall sessions during her time in office. Shea-Porter, who served in Congress from 2007-2010, is challenging Republican incumbent Rep. Frank Guinta for his First District seat in this fall’s elections. "Carol Shea-Porter is still ignoring the problems of the economy and is instead focused on partisan games," Tory Mazzola, executive director of the state Republican Party, wrote March 8 in an email. "(Her) record of helping people get back to work is as bleak as her record of refusing to host town halls when she was in Congress." We’ll leave it to voters to decide about the former congresswoman’s jobs record, but as for her history with town hall meetings, that sounds like a job for PolitiFact. Shea-Porter, like some of her former congressional colleagues, has been taking heat for years over town hall meetings. The former House member held 14 meetings over her first term in office, nine the first year and five the second, according to a campaign spokeswoman. But, after her re-election in 2008, heated discussion of federal healthcare reform prompted a series of protests and shouting matches at meetings across the country, and Shea-Porter initially scheduled only telephone town hall sessions instead of regular meetings. This drew criticism from several state newspapers. "We know how a town meeting is supposed to work, and it certainly isn't by telephone. It is neighbors meeting face-to-face to discuss the issues," the Portsmouth Herald wrote Aug. 16 in an editorial titled "Delegations should meet with voters." The Union Leader, the state’s largest newspaper, followed up two days later, criticizing Shea-Porter and fellow U.S. Rep. Paul Hodes, D-N.H. for skipping the meetings. "Hodes and Shea-Porter need to put down the phone and the other contrived and restricted public access points they have ginned up and instead place themselves in front of the public," the paper wrote in a similar editorial. "Really. It's not difficult." Within two weeks, Shea-Porter heeded the calls, scheduling a pair of public meetings over one day at the end of the summer recess to discuss healthcare reform. "This is exactly what we wanted to hear," Shea-Porter told the Portsmouth Herald after the session, which was interrupted by shouts and boos. "The questions were tough, but we were pleased people showed up." Five months later, she returned to the state during the next congressional recess, hosting three town hall sessions in two days over a January weekend in 2010. And, she returned to the state two months after that to speak on the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010. During that time, she had eight public meetings in 10 days, touting the the federal health care law. Those sessions, which drew hefty protest and complaints, according to media reports, brought her town hall number up to 13 meetings between August 2009 and April 2010. Here's how that compares with other members of the N.H. delegation: Guinta, who defeated Shea-Porter in the November 2010 election, has held 19 town halls since he took office last year, according to spokesman J. Mark Powell. But, both U.S. Rep. Charlie Bass, and Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, held 10 such sessions last year - one in each county, spokesmen of the lawmakers said. While U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has served since 2008, her office failed to offer specific numbers on the senator's public meetings with constituents. Despite the public meetings, Shea-Porter took some criticism for her meeting schedule. In June 2010, the New York Times included her in a story about Democrats who did not hold town halls to avoid criticism. "In New Hampshire, where open political meetings are deeply ingrained in the state’s traditions, Representative Carol Shea-Porter’s campaign Web site had this message for visitors: ‘No upcoming events scheduled. Please visit us again soon!’," reporter Jeff Zeleny wrote in the June 6, 2010 article titled "Democrats Skip Town Halls to Avoid Voter Outrage.’ Still other publications noted Shea-Porter’s efforts to meet voters. In August 2010, Drew Cline, opinions editor of the Union Leader tweeted a correction to an Aug. 10 editorial that had suggested she held no such meetings. And, before that, in March 2010, the national political website RealClearPolitics.com credited Shea-Porter as one of the members of Congress to continue to hold meetings amid the strong criticism. "But others appear to have signed on to the plan for aggressive outreach. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D-NH), for instance, has four town hall meetings planned specifically about health care," reporter Mike Memoli wrote in a March 26, 2010 post. Our ruling: The Republican party says Shea Porter had a "record of refusing to host town halls when she was in Congress." There was a point a few years ago when Shea-Porter did not hold town hall meetings. She drew criticism from New Hampshire news outlets after she scheduled no in-person meetings between April 2008 and August 2009, while the federal health care debate reached a fever pitch. But, once she resumed the public forums, she stayed in plain sight. In the eight months between August 2009 and April 2010, she hosted 13 meetings, more than some members of the current congressional delegation, and, after she voted in favor of the controversial Affordable Care Act, she went before her constituents, holding eight meetings in less than two weeks.

pomt-08524	"Alex Sink funneled three quarters of a million dollars in no-bid contracts to Bank of America."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/05/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-alex-sink-funneled-770k-her-former/	Rick Scott, who masterfully ran an insider vs. outsider campaign to defeat Bill McCollum in Florida's Republican primary for governor, is trying to use a similar tactic against his Democratic opponent, Alex Sink. Scott is highlighting Sink's record as a member of the Florida Cabinet in a new ad called "No bid," alleging that Sink steered government contracts -- and the money that goes with it -- to her former employer Bank of America. Watch the ad here. "Newspapers discovered Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink funneled three quarters of a million dollars in no-bid contracts to Bank of America," the narrator says. "That's the same Bank of America once run by, you guessed it, Alex Sink." The ad goes on to say that Sink never disclosed her conflict of interest and "never even asked for other bids." We wanted to put the no-bid Bank of America contract claim to the rigors of the Truth-O-Meter. The single source in the ad is a St. Petersburg Times article published Aug. 2, 2009. The article, written by Sydney P. Freedberg and Adam C. Smith, deals with Sink's decision to create a blind trust to manage her personal investments. A blind trust is pretty much what it sounds like: Sink's investments are managed by third-party trustees, and Sink does not know when she buys or sells stocks. She created the blind trust in December 2006 to guard against speculation that her stock portfolio would affect her decisions as state chief financial officer. Those very allegations dogged her predecessor, Tom Gallagher, who while in office traded stock in companies that had contracts with the state or were regulated by his office. The Times article pointed out some flaws in Sink's decision, namely that the trust isn't truly blind because Sink knew what investments initially made up the blind trust. She also isn't required to list the specific investments that make up her blind trust as part of her annual financial disclosure form. What does any of that have to do with funneling money to Bank of America, as Scott's ad alleges? Sink said that what went into her blind trust is substantially what she reported on a financial disclosure statement in 2006. Among other holdings, it listed two accounts that contained $4.9 million in assets, including stock in Bank of America and Raymond James. Sink spent 26 years in banking, retiring in 2000 as head of Bank of America's Florida operations. That year, she made $3.4 million from the bank in salary, pension, deferred compensation and stock grants. In their article, Freedberg and Smith pointed out that Sink could still own Bank of America stock. And in late 2008, Freedberg and Smith said, she "voted with the governor and other Cabinet members to allow negotiated, or no-bid, bond deals for a financial underwriting team that includes her former employer, Bank of America. One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit." If a state official casts a vote that would result in private gain, Florida law requires the official to disclose the conflict within 15 days. The law also prohibits a public official from having a financial relationship with any business entity that would create a continuing conflict or impede his or her duties. Sink didn't declare a conflict in this case. Sink says she didn't know what interests she had, so she had no conflict to declare. That's the background for the story, which is the foundation for the ad. We can best analyze Scott's claim by taking apart and expanding on the two sentences in the Freedberg and Smith story. First up: "Sink voted with the governor and other Cabinet members to allow negotiated, or no-bid, bond deals for a financial underwriting team that includes her former employer, Bank of America." Credit crisis creates bond changes At the height of the credit crisis in the fall of 2008, the state -- like everyone -- was having trouble borrowing money or selling bonds to borrow money to fund capital projects. Of particular concern was the extreme volatility of the municipal bond market. Florida Division of Bond Finance Director Ben Watkins said the municipal bond market had slowed to 15 to 20 percent of its normal weekly flow, and interest rates varied daily by as much as 10-20 basis points. One possible solution, Watkins said, was to add another way for the state to issue some bonds. The state sells bonds through something called a competitive bond sale. In a competitive process, any broker dealer or dealer bank could bid on the bonds at a designated date and time. The bonds are then awarded to whoever offers the lowest interest rate. But the rigidity of the competitive process -- the date and time -- combined with a disinterest in the market, could put Florida at an adverse fiscal position, Watkins said. An alternative is something called a negotiated sale process. In a negotiated sale, an underwriter is chosen by the state to purchase the bonds. The underwriter than re-sells the bonds to individual investors. Because the timing can be carefully planned, partners in a negotiated bond sale aren't at the mercy of the whims of investors or the news of the day. Conversely, in better times, partners could get locked into a higher interest rate than they otherwise could have seen on the open market. To start the process, Watkins issued a request for proposals to find bond underwriters on Oct. 20, 2008. The state received 39 responses by the deadline of Nov. 3. A few weeks later, at a Nov. 20, 2008, meeting of the Cabinet, Watkins asked Cabinet members to approve a consortium of underwriters, and the negotiated sale process. "If the market conditions continue to improve, stabilize, we may not ever need to use the negotiated method of sale in order to borrow money," Watkins said in a response to a question from Gov. Charlie Crist. "So it really is a Plan B. It's contingency planning. We didn't know six weeks ago how long these problems would persist, and so it was prudent for us to plan an alternative, a Plan B, if you will, to be able to strategically access credit or sell bonds if in fact we couldn't do it in the normal way." During a susequent discussion, Attorney General Bill McCollum asked that the state add a two-year sunset on the approval of the negotiated sale process with the consortium of underwriters. He moved the approval of the sale process for a two-year period. Sink seconded the motion. It was approved unanimously. Who made the consortium? A group of five large firms, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan, three mid-size firms, three small firms and an Internet based firm. Now, we can tackle Scott's specific claim, which comes from the second sentence in the Freedberg/Smith story: "One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit." Exploring the Bank of America related deal Less than three weeks after approving a new way of selling bonds, on Dec. 9, 2008, the governor and Cabinet were asked to issue up to $300 million in lottery revenue bonds to help implement classroom size reductions mandated by the class size amendment to the Florida Constitution. Watkins proposed either a negotiated or competitive sale, depending on market conditions, and asked the Cabinet and governor to approve a resolution authorizing either process. Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Bronson moved approval of the resolution, which was seconded by McColllum. It passed 4-0. Fast forward to spring 2009. The Division of Bond Finance decided to use the negotiated process, not the competitive process, to sell the bonds. They negotiated the bond sale with the consortium and chose Merrill Lynch as senior manager. A total of 12 underwriters participated in the bond sale, and were paid a commission based on their sales. Merrill Lynch sold more than half of the bonds and received $739,773 in fees. Bank of America sold 2 percent of the bonds and received $30,548 in fees. That's a total of $770,321, and the basis for the claim in the Scott ad. How? Because Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch. On Sept. 15, 2008, Bank of America announced an agreement to acquire Merrill Lynch. The merger was approved by stockholders Dec. 5, 2008, though it was not completed until January 2009. In their Nov. 3, 2008, responses to the RFP, both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch noted the pending merger. "On September 15, 2008, the Corporation announced that it has agreed to acquire Merrill Lynch," Bank of America wrote in its response. Merrill Lynch's description of the pending transaction was almost identical. Our ruling As you might have noticed by now, at word 1,438 of this fact check, Scott's claim is way more complex than it sounds in his 30-second spot, "No bid." We're checking his claim that "Alex Sink funneled three quarters of a million dollars in no-bid contracts to Bank of America," the bank she used to work for. Let's take this one step at a time. Alex Sink funneled ... This is a misleading verb choice. First, she was one of four statewide elected officials to agree to change the process for selling state bonds that ultimately resulted in paying $770,321 in commission fees to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. Second, she had no idea when she approved the new bond sale process -- called a negotiated sale -- that Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive $770,321. That came months later as part of the negotiations between the bond underwriters and the Division of Bond Finance. Three quarters of a million dollars ... The money in question is just about right. The total commission paid to Bank of America and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit was $770,321. In no-bid contracts ... This specific claim has generated some controversy. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org, for instance, said that the contract at issue was not a no-bid contract. We disagree. Here are the facts. The state held an RFP for companies to be bond underwriters in general, not to specifically bid on bond sales. Thirty-nine companies responded, and ultimately 12 were chosen. There was no competitive bidding for the $300 million lottery revenue bond issue. The state negotiated a deal among those 12 companies. That's a no-bid contract to us, because the setup specifically prevents open competition that could produce lower interest rates. The state said it needed to pursue negotiated deals because of the volatility of the credit market, and maybe that's true. But the question here is whether there were bids for this specific bond issue. There were not. To Bank of America ... The fees actually were paid to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America acquired. But what's critical to note, again, is that while Bank of America interests represented two of the 12 members of the state bond underwriting team, Sink had no idea when she approved the slate of underwriters what specific role each bank would play in any specific bond sale. And even when she approved the $300 million lottery bond issue, it wasn't yet clear whether the sale of those bonds would be by a competitive or negotiated process. The resolution she and three others approved included either option. We should note that the ad claims that "your tax dollars" paid for the Bank of America commissions. That's not true. The bond issue was using lottery revenues, not general tax revenues. That means you buying lottery tickets paid for the bond sale and the bank commissions. The basis of the claim in the Scott ad is a paragraph in a St. Petersburg Times story about Sink, saying she "voted with the governor and other Cabinet members to allow negotiated, or no-bid, bond deals for a financial underwriting team that includes her former employer, Bank of America. One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit." That statement is accurate, as it properly notes that the negotiated bond sale process resulted in $770,000 in fees for Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, without trying to tie the money directly to Sink. Scott isn't nearly as careful in his TV ad. Particularly, his use of the word "funneled" overshadows some of the facts Scott gets right in his claim. Sink didn't funnel $770,000 to Bank of America. First, she was one of four votes on the Cabinet to approve the particular type of bond issue in question -- along with Republicans Charlie Bronson and Bill McCollum and then-Republican Charlie Crist. Second, she had no way of knowing how much commission Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive for the bond sale when she approved the deal. Those details came months later during negotiations between state bond administrators and the banks. We rate Scott's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

For years, accused Catholic priests were routinely transferred from one parish or school to another, and many of them continued molesting children. Certainly, transfers were actually ordered by the archdiocese, not by lawyers such as Flynn who were retained by the archdiocese. But was Flynn, whose campaign has been dogged by questions about the priest scandal, involved in those transfers? Flynn represented the archdiocese from 1989 to 2004 and was heavily involved in priest abuse cases. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The history Earlier on the day of the debate, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigative columnist Daniel Bice posted a column about Flynn’s work. The article detailed cases indicating Flynn, to some extent, was part of the transfers: Informed of Adamsky transfer: In an August 1992 letter, the vicar for clergy in the archdiocese contacted Flynn about the transfer of Father Raymond Adamsky in response to allegations of abuse. A bishop "suggested that I send a copy of the new assignment for Fr. Ray Adamsky for your records," the letter said. "We hope this will be satisfactory to all involved. Thanks for meeting with us. It was good to have an update on everyone." Adamsky was transferred 11 times during his work for the church. Flynn’s campaign told Bice the meeting was not about Adamsky's transfer, but about legal claims regarding Adamsky and others. In any case, Flynn was at least aware of the transfer. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. Lawyers involved: Adamsky had his ministry restricted by a bishop in 1991, but was allowed to continue to serve as priest at the church and have access to its school. Church officials removed Adamsky from the parish in 1992 after two more children complained to their principal about the priest's "rough physical contact" with the pair. The archdiocese's website says: "Negotiations between lawyers took place about what kind of assignment would be agreeable, and it was determined that chaplain work at a retirement home would be possible." So, Flynn was not named, but he was a key attorney for the archdiocese at the time. Another meeting: In a case involving a different priest, Father Mike Krejci, Flynn is listed in court records as being in a November 1994 meeting with Krejci, the archbishop and other archdiocese officials. Krejci had just been accused in a letter from another priest of sexually abusing a child. Flynn’s campaign told Bice the records do not indicate that the meeting involving Flynn had to do with a reassignment of Krejci. The decision regarding the priest's future was made at a meeting the next day, without Flynn in attendance, the campaign contended. So, here, too, Flynn is centrally involved in a priest case and attended a meeting about one of the accused priests the day before the priest’s transfer. Response from Flynn For this fact check, Flynn campaign manager Bryan Kennedy told us that despite the documents cited in Bice’s column, there are no letters from Flynn "directing the archbishop to transfer priests nor are there directives or memos that Matt signed off on that would show his approval or collaboration in making decisions about transfers." Fair enough. But it’s also clear Flynn was heavily involved in cases where accused priests were transferred. Our rating Flynn says he was "not part of transferring" any priests accused of sexual abuse. There is no evidence to show that Flynn advised the archdiocese to transfer priests accused of molesting children to different parishes. But Flynn was a top attorney for the archdiocese during a period of years when a number of such transfers were done, and he had at least some involvement with cases in which accused priests were transferred.

pomt-00712	Delta has had the most animal deaths among U.S. carriers in the past five years	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/29/bloomberg-bloombergcom/pet-death-claim-leaves-out-important-details/	A new tracking device available to pets being transported in the cargo hold was supposed to calm passengers about flying with Fido on Delta Air Lines. But coverage of gadget to monitor temperature and crate positioning also included some data that may have had the opposite effect. "Delta has had the most animal deaths among U.S. carriers in the past five years, with 51, though it has had only 6 since 2013," according to a Bloomberg.com news report on March 31, 2015. Reaction on social media was less measured, at one point calling the Atlanta-based airline "responsible" for the most pet deaths on U.S. carriers. So PolitiFact Georgia decided to look at the statistics to see how Delta measures up when it comes to ferrying our furry friends. The U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to file "animal incident" reports regarding injuries or deaths to animals being flown in the cargo hold. The data is compiled into monthly reports that also include information such as arrival times and lost baggage. (As an aside, while the government requires reports on pet deaths, there is no similar requirement for any people who may perish during flights). PolitiFact Georgia reviewed annual tallies of the animal incidents for the past five years and found Bloomberg was correct on the numbers: Carrier 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 5-yr Total Alaska 4 4 1 8 3 20 American 6 5 6 1 3 21 American Eagle 1 0 0 0 0 1 Continental 6 3 0 0 0 9 Delta 16 19 10 2 4 51 Hawaiian 2 2 1 1 2 8 United 4 2 12 9 5 32 Total 39 35 30 21 17 142 But there is more to the data than just numbers. First, it’s important to recognize that some airlines accept pets only if they are small enough to fit in the cabin. Southwest Airlines, for instance, wouldn’t be on the list of cargo hold deaths because its policy does not allow for that kind of transport. And mergers in the industry will skew the numbers, too. Continental did not see zero animal deaths since 2011, for instance. It is just now part of United. It is also worth noting that when Delta saw the number of pet deaths increase in 2011, it carried far more pets than other airlines in part because of its broad route network. That year, the number of pets that were injured or died on Delta was less than 0.2 percent of those it carried, the airline said. Looking at it that way, it’s highly misleading to compare Delta with airlines such as Hawaiian. The smaller airline flies about a tenth of the miles that Delta does, yet in recent years has seen nearly as many animal deaths. Still, Delta was concerned about its increase and expanded its restrictions on certain pets. In particular, it stopped accepting snub-nosed pets such as bulldogs or Pekinese as checked items, since the animals have more difficulty breathing. As Bloomberg notes, the changes have helped dramatically reduce the number of animals that ran into trouble, with deaths down nearly 79 percent from 2011. Those numbers have fallen even as the sheer volume of animals it transports remains high. Delta flies tens of thousands of pets every year, out of the half a million that federal data show are in plane cargo holds. About a thousand Delta flights take off out of Atlanta every day alone. "We can’t say that every flight had pets on it. We can say that even one death is unacceptable," said Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant. "Every pet is important to us. We wouldn’t accept the animal if we didn’t feel confident about their safety." Incident reports back up Delta’s confidence. The majority of injuries and deaths are not from crew mishandling of the animals or in-flight problems. Rather, reports show the animals panicked in the kennels and attempted to chew or scratch their way out. Some animals died in their attempts. The American Veterinary Medicine Association recommends that pet owners acclimate their dogs and cats to crates well before flights, to help minimize that level of stress on the animals. The organization does not recommend tranquilizers, since that can depress breathing and increase stress. Likewise, it agrees with airlines on restrictions on some short-snout dog breeds, given they are already susceptible to breathing problems, said Dr. Kendall Houlihan, the assistant director of the AVMA’s animal welfare division. The limitations can vary for every pet, considering underlying health conditions, age and other factors, she said. "The most important thing is for owners to speak to veterinarian as early as possible before the trip," Houlihan said. "Part of that discussion needs to be whether air travel is appropriate." Many pet owners have already decided that air travel is right for their dogs and cats, and nearly a half million fly every year without incident. Bloomberg news said that Delta has had the most animal deaths of U.S. carriers in the last decade. The numbers back up that claim, but they miss many of the reasons why. As one of the nation’s largest carriers, Delta cannot be accurately compared to significantly smaller airlines who may have higher pet deaths per miles flown, a statistic unavailable from airlines or government data. Without that missing context, the claim is just about numbers. And the numbers are accurate but misleading. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-07646	"For the first time in more than a decade, imports accounted for less than half of (the oil) we consumed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/15/barack-obama/president-obama-says-first-time-more-decade-oil-im/	As gas prices once again climb, President Obama took some time during a press conference on March 11, 2011, to defend his energy policy. Despite a temporary ban on new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico following the massive Deepwater Horizon spill last summer, Obama said, "we’re producing more oil, and we’re importing less." "For the first time in more than a decade," Obama said, "imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed." In a separate item, we took a look at Obama's claim about the production side of the equation, specifically that, "Last year, American oil production reached its highest level since 2003." In this item, we'll focus on imports, and whether, as Obama said, that for the first time in over a decade, "imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed." We turned first to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics. There are two main ways to measure this statistic, and we'll begin with the way that supports Obama's comment. The EIA uses a "net imports" figure to measure U.S. dependence on foreign oil. This figure compares the amount of oil produced in the U.S. with the amount of oil consumed in the U.S. Using that measure, the U.S. produced an amount equal to 50.7 percent of what it consumed. Using the same measure, imports fell to 49.3 percent of what the U.S. consumed in 2010 (as a yearly average); down from 51.5 percent in 2009. The net import percentage hasn't been that low since 1997, when it was 49.3 percent. It peaked in 2005 at 60.3 percent and has steadily decreased every year since. So by that measure, Obama's figures are correct. But the fact is that the U.S. doesn't use all of the oil it produces. Some of it is exported. Ultimately, the oil goes where suppliers can make the most profit on it, EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan said. Looking strictly at the petroleum consumed by the U.S. last year, 61.2 percent of it was imported, according to EIA data. That percentage has been declining for years, but it is nonetheless much higher than the "less than half" figure cited by Obama. Incidentally, many may find the sources of imported oil surprising. Slightly over half comes from the Western Hemisphere. The largest share of imports came from Canada (23 percent); followed by Venezuela (11 percent), Saudi Arabia, (10 percent), Mexico (9 percent) and Nigeria (8.3 percent). In 2009, 17 percent of the U.S.'s oil imports came from the Persian Gulf. But again, Obama's statistic depends on the way you calculate it. By a mainstream measure of "dependence on foreign oil," the U.S. produced domestically a quantity of petroleum that was slightly more than half the amount it consumed. But strictly speaking, imports made up 61 percent of the oil actually consumed in the U.S. last year. And so we rate Obama's statement Half True.

pomt-14028	In California, "the windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/31/donald-trump/trump-exaggerates-wind-turbine-eagle-deaths/	Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, says he favors energy from all sources to power America. Wind is on his list, but in remarks in Bismarck, N.D., Trump emphasized that wind turbines are not without their drawbacks. "There are places for wind but if you go to various places in California, wind is killing all of the eagles," Trump said. "You know if you shoot an eagle, if you kill an eagle, they want to put you in jail for five years. And yet the windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles. … They’re killing them by the hundreds." Setting aside Trump’s exaggeration about killing all of the eagles, we wondered, are wind turbines in California killing "hundreds and hundreds," as he said? The truth is, we lack complete data, but Shawn Smallwood, California’s leading ornithologist for the study of raptors and wind turbines, told us Trump is exaggerating. Smallwood says about 100 eagles die each year due to impacts with the spinning blades on windmills. "Mr. Trump could not have arrived at his number (hundreds and hundreds) from any reliable source, unless he is referring to all eagles killed by industrial-scale wind turbines since they were installed in the early 1980s," Smallwood said. "Cumulatively over time, there have been hundreds of eagles killed, probably about 2,000." We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not hear back. Smallwood has worked intensively on one of the country’s first wind farms at Altamont Pass in Northern California. At one time, nearly 7,000 windmills churned out power there. But a combination of lawsuits and public pressure has cut that number by more than half. "My best estimate for golden eagle fatalities in the Altamont Pass was 60 per year until the last couple of years when the old turbines started getting replaced by larger turbines that are being more carefully sited to reduce eagle fatalities," Smallwood said. Today, Smallwood said the number of eagle fatalities is much lower. Altamont Pass lies in Alameda County. Government figures show 14 golden eagles killed there in 2013. And that was two years before one of the leading operators in the wind farm announced it was shutting down over 800 turbines. By the way, bald eagle deaths appear to be rare. Also, as a species, there is less concern because their population, about 70,000, is growing, while the population of golden eagles, about 20,000, is at best holding steady and could be declining. To be sure, Smallwood said much information is missing statewide. Several facilities fail to provide regular monitoring reports, or at least, they fail to make them public. Audubon California agrees with Smallwood’s estimate. Spokesman Garrison Frost told us "this is about as accurate as you’re going to get." A spokesman for the American Bird Conservancy told us that they believe the number remains high. "It is unknown how many golden eagles are being killed each year in California, but based on what we know from Altamont, it is likely that over 100 are dying each year at wind farms," said Steve Holmer. "Many of these birds could be saved with proper siting and mitigation measures." Our ruling Trump said that in California, windmills are killing hundreds and hundreds of eagles. The best estimate is that about 100 golden eagles die each year from collisions with wind turbine blades. The data are not perfect, but the people most concerned about the welfare of the eagles do not go along with Trump’s figure. While the data are sketchy, the information at hand tells us that windmills were more deadly in the past, but today, fewer turbines, new designs and better siting have reduced fatalities. Trump is correct that California wind farms are a threat to eagles but not on the magnitude he suggested. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-13031	Hillary Clinton in 2005 co-sponsored legislation that would jail flag burners.	true	/georgia/statements/2016/dec/02/blog-posting/clinton-did-co-sponsor-legislation-decade-ago-jail/	One thing has become apparent in the world of President-elect Donald Trump -- no incendiary tweet goes to waste. Just this week, Trump lobbed an early-morning zinger across the globe, opining on Twitter: "Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!" The chattering class lit up the morning talk shows. Even some key Republicans said Trump had gone too far. Experts pointed out that flag burning, no matter how distasteful, is protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled it is free speech and a legal form of protest. Some media outlets complained that Trump was being treated unfairly in the firestorm of criticism that followed. After all, they stated, Democrat Hillary Clinton had also once proposed jail time for flag burners. "For Clinton supporters, I’m sorry to say you don’t have the high ground again; then-Sen. Clinton co-sponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005, which carried a 12-month jail sentence to anyone who desecrates the American flag to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace," Matt Vespa wrote on the conservative online site Townhall.com. PolitiFact decided to look into that bit of political history. As it turns out, Clinton did back flag-burning legislation more than a decade ago. The site Congress.Gov states the Flag Protection Act of 2005 was introduced in the U.S. Senate in October 2005 as Senate Bill 1911. The site summarizes the bill this way: "Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; (2) intentionally threatening or intimidating any person, or group of persons, by burning a U.S. flag; or (3) stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag belonging to the United States, or belonging to another person on U.S. lands, and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag." The bill sets a fine of up to $100,000 and jail time of up to a year for burning a U.S. flag and higher penalties for stealing or damaging one on federal property. Then-U.S. Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah, a Republican, sponsored the bill. Clinton is listed as one of four co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it died. Political scientists point out that Republicans and Democrats have used the flag-burning issue to their benefit. The courts have ruled, but it still plays well in the court of public opinion where voters reside. "Both parties have used the flag issue, mostly as political posturing, because everyone knows it is ‘settled law’ and the prospects for change are extremely remote," said political scientist Kerwin Swint of Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta. "It's usually a Republican issue for the GOP base, but in this instance, Hillary Clinton, and other Democratic legislators, got into the act." In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court first established flag burning as a protected First Amendment right in Texas v. Johnson. Back in 1984, Gregory Lee Johnson burned a flag at the Republican National Convention in Dallas in a protest against presidential candidate Ronald Reagan. Johnson was arrested and charged with breaking a state law. The Supreme Court voted 5-4 in favor of Johnson and against the state of Texas. Johnson’s actions, the majority argued, were symbolic speech, political in nature, and could be expressed even if it upset those who disagreed with him. "The decisions remain controversial to the present day, and Congress in 2006 attempted to pass a joint resolution to propose an amendment to the Constitution to prohibit flag desecration, which failed by just one vote in the Senate," states the blog Constitution Daily. Our ruling The online site Townhall.com said Hillary Clinton co-sponsored legislation in 2005 that would jail flag burners. Clinton did indeed co-sponsor a bill that would have done just that. Republicans have backed similar legislation in the past, even though the courts have ruled flag burning is legally protected. We rate the Townhall.com statement True.

pomt-15119	"Any Republican that has led for two months and led every state has won the GOP nomination."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/10/matthew-dowd/dowd-historic-polling-pattern-points-trump/	One big question in the 2016 race for the White House is when -- or if -- Donald Trump’s campaign will run out of gas. Trump’s poll numbers continue to climb even as he stumbles on questions about policy, recants his past liberal leanings, and makes comments that draw the ire of women and Hispanics. Given the conventional wisdom that Trump has so far defied some law of political gravity, eyebrows went up when ABC News analyst and GOP political consultant Matthew Dowd declared that Trump has the earmarks of a winner. "I think Donald Trump, as of today, is the Republican nominee for president," Dowd said on ABC’s This Week on Sept. 6, 2015. "He leads nationally in every single poll for more than two months. He leads every single state, including favorite-son states like Florida, where he leads Jeb Bush. Jeb Bush is third. And any Republican that has led for two months and led every state has won the GOP nomination." We wanted to check Dowd’s history. Is it accurate that the Republican who has topped the polls nationally and in states that conduct polls this early goes on to win the nomination? Dowd told us that the numbers back him up, although he didn’t share any hard data. He said he was thinking of every race since Ronald Reagan ran in 1980. It’s relatively simple to find national polls going back to the summer of 1979. Finding state polls is dicier. Limited Iowa and New Hampshire polls exist, and even those don’t provide the two consecutive months in every election that Dowd said he had in mind. Dowd told us his list of states included ones such as South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. Early polling in those states is even spottier, especially during the older elections. But for the polls we could find, we found there were three years when the pattern Dowd identified roughly held up. Our sources include the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, Polling Report, Selzer and Company (the Iowa Poll firm), the Granite State Poll, the Odum Institute, 538.com, and political scientist Martin Cohen at James Madison University. To keep in step with where we are in the present election, we looked at polls in the spring and summer in years when no incumbent Republican was running. Source: Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, Polling Report, Odum Institute, et al. Three candidates in three elections, Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and George W. Bush, won the pre-September polling trifecta and went on to win the nomination. For the record, Trump has led the polls in Iowa, New Hampshire and nationally for the past two months. Plus, he’s in the lead in South Carolina, Florida and other states. These days, there’s more polling. But as you go back in time, you find gaps in the month-to-month record for all states. That lack of monthly state data weakens the support for Dowd’s statement somewhat, but the general point holds up in the early primary states and nationally. A bevy of caveats The political scientists we reached don’t put much stock in the predictive power of Dowd’s observation. Martin Cohen co-authored The Party Decides, an assessment of the modern nomination process. Cohen, and others, see early polls as mainly driven by name recognition, a factor that plays itself out as time goes by. Cohen said the pattern Dowd spotted reflects forces that might be less obvious than polls. Cohen told us that endorsements by party leaders is much more telling. "Most times the poll leader is the endorsement leader," Cohen said. "In the few cases where the poll leader is not the endorsement leader, the poll leader fails. This occurred most notably in 2008 with Giuliani leading and 2012 when a number of candidates equaled or overtook Romney in the polls but didn't come close to his endorsement totals. I think 2016 will turn out this way with Trump losing to someone who has more elite support." Political scientist Marc Meredith at the University of Pennsylvania discounts the significance of the polling pattern on statistical grounds. The claim’s power rests on only three elections out of six. "We just have a very little sample to draw upon, and no sample to draw on in this circumstance when we consider the fact that Trump never won a single election," Meredith said. "So drawing on the experiences of Reagan, Dole, and George W. Bush may not be that useful." Pollster and political scientist Andrew Smith at the University of New Hampshire Survey Center noted that while Trump might have the lead, his numbers are relatively modest. "I'd be very cautious about claiming that Trump has any sort of ‘lead’ anywhere," Smith said. "I'm not aware that he has even broken the 40 percent mark." Lastly, Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake University, said the number of Republican candidates in this cycle makes it harder to draw lessons from the past. "The larger the field -- if the increased number includes realistic candidacies and not just actual or potential flashes in the pan -- the more difficult it is to predict a likely outcome," Goldford said. Our ruling Dowd said that any Republican who has led in the polls for two months running at both the state and national levels had gone on to win the nomination. Dowd did not provide the polling data he used, and the historical record is thin across all the states he had in mind. Going back to the 1980 election, there does not seem to be two consecutive months of polling in the spring and summer even in the states with the most polls, Iowa and New Hampshire. But the record does show the sort of early polling dominance leading to nomination success that Dowd described. Our principle is that it’s up to the speaker to prove his claim. There’s some substance to the statement, but not enough to fully back it up. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-15196	Between 2008 and 2014, "criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/17/tom-tancredo/tancredo-muffs-illegal-immigrant-murder-stats/	As several of Donald Trump’s Republican opponents have pointed out, his fiery statements on any given subject strike a chord among a set of voters who feel the political system has failed them. Tom Tancredo, a former GOP politician turned pundit, credits Trump for "forcing all 17 Republican candidates to talk about the social costs of illegal immigration." In an Aug. 8, 2015, article for the conservative website Breitbart, Tancredo said the "mainstream media – including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal — are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime." Tancredo provided these bullet points: "Between 2008 and 2014, 40 percent of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34 percent and Arizona 17.8 percent." "During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6 percent of the total population in those states." Tancredo said his source was a presentation from a conservative think tank, the Center for Security Policy. Several readers asked us to look into Tancredo’s core statement that between 2008 and 2014, "criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York." There are serious glitches in his claim. He botches the takeaway of the presentation, which has plenty of issues on its own. A botched summary We tried a variety of ways to reach Tancredo and did not hear back. In his column, he embedded a video of the presentation by the Center for Security Policy and invited readers to watch the whole thing. We did. The first thing that jumped out was Tancredo mangled the dates. He said "criminal aliens" accounted for 38 percent of murder convictions in five states between 2008 and 2014. In fact, the presentation offered numbers for 2005 to 2008. That's not the only issue. The presentation’s author, James Simpson, told us he had emailed Breitbart about Tancredo’s use of his presentation. "(Tancredo) quoted the whole thing incorrectly," Simpson told PunditFact. Our research found that even if Tancredo had quoted the presentation as it was given, there would still be plenty of concern about its accuracy. State data not prevalent Simpson’s report includes findings from two separate sources: an article that describes 2008-14 data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, and his digest of a 2011 Government Accountability Office report, which uses 2005-08 numbers. We got into the weeds of each source, and the fact is neither provides an accurate look at the percentage of murders committed by criminal aliens in those five states. The real figure may be impossible to know; Texas appears to be the only one of the five states that actually keeps track of convictions of criminal aliens. The "criminal aliens" label applies to noncitizens who have either legal or illegal immigration status. (It is incorrect to consider all of them as illegal immigrants.) With various estimates floating around in Tancredo’s article, it’s useful to start with the solid numbers out of Texas. The Texas Department of Public Safety continuously updates its tally of criminal aliens booked into local jails, tracking the charges filed and whether the person was convicted. The agency’s latest report covers June 1, 2011, to July 31, 2015. In that time, 344 noncitizens were convicted of homicide. In about the same period, Texas had 4,571 murders. (There’s a difference between calendar and fiscal years, but as of this writing, the differences balance out.) So based on counts of actual cases, criminal aliens account for 7.5 percent of all homicides in Texas. That figure is striking because it is one-fifth as large as the number Simpson gave in his presentation. Simpson said, "Illegal aliens have committed 35 percent of all murders in Texas since 2008." Simpson told us he had not seen the official Texas report. He had relied solely on an article for PJ Media. In our view, official hard data beats something in an article. Murky federal data The numbers from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a widely respected source, are also imprecise — which is obvious from all of the report’s cautionary notes. In 2011, the GAO aimed to learn the cost of keeping criminal aliens behind bars. The government analysts wrote that due to the large number of arrest files, they randomly selected 1,000 criminal aliens in five states — Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas — and took a close look at their arrest records. The researchers detailed a host of caveats: At the state level, it’s possible that some people are counted twice if, for example, they are first kept at a county jail and are then transferred to a state prison. And the margin of error for the overall tally of homicides, as well as other crimes, was +/- 20 percent. The GAO was clear about the lack of precision in its results. A close look shows why anyone should use them with great caution. Because this was a study of costs, the only state prisoners examined fell under a federal reimbursement program called the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Working with broad estimates, the GAO gave the percentage of convicted murders in each state’s population under that program. We used those percentages to come up with the number of criminal alien murderers in each state (see our chart). Without wading too deep into the weeds, we found that our analysis of the publicly available data wasn’t matching up with Simpson’s. Simpson’s total of murders is about 7,085, and our estimate was much lower at 5,300-5,400. Further, in Florida, he reported three times as many killers as our estimate, and his percentage of all homicides due to criminal immigrants in Texas was about double the official number (albeit for a different time period). We should note that Simpson’s numbers are the basis for Tancredo’s claim that criminal aliens accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York. When we asked Simpson about his figures, he said after several months of writing to the GAO, he got the actual raw numbers. But Simpson’s figures must be based on some statistical assumptions, not raw data, because his total is larger than the number of individual cases examined by the GAO. And Simpson told us "the whole thing is difficult to understand frankly, and they couldn’t explain it very well over the phone either. I may have to go back to them for clarification." Also, Simpson compared the number of immigrants convicted of murder to the total number of murders. Tancredo said the percentages referred to all murder convictions. Since many murders go unsolved, that statement is clearly incorrect. This error underscores another way that Tancredo misquoted Simpson's work. We do have the number of people arrested for homicide in Texas 2011-2014 (a shorter period than the one for the number of criminal aliens convicted of homicide). Convicted aliens represent 12 percent of all homicide arrests, but it's important to note that due to the mismatched time periods, that figure is too high. The bottom line is this: Even the man who generated the numbers, which Tancredo then misquoted, expresses uncertainty about their precision. Our ruling Tancredo said that between 2008 and 2014, over one-third of the murder convictions in Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas were committed by illegal immigrants. The man who presented the data Tancredo cites said Tancredo "quoted the whole thing incorrectly." Tancredo used the wrong time period. He thought the baseline number was homicide convictions when it was actually all homicides. Most important of all, he took the presentation he relied on at face value and ignored the hard numbers available from the Texas Department of Public Safety. And while Tancredo might not have known it, the researcher whose work he used himself has questions about the underlying data he used. We have hard data from Texas that refutes the big and estimated numbers Tancredo used. Undocumented immigrants do commit murder, but perhaps only one-fifth as often as Tancredo said. We rate the claim False. Update: We added the Texas homicide arrest data after we first published.

pomt-10181	"Grateful insurance company executives and their lobbyists" from Bermuda gave McCain $50,000.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/24/barack-obama/mccain-did-get-money-from-bermuda-connected-source/	An attack ad from Barack Obama looks at a trip John McCain made to Bermuda last year. "Bermuda. It’s more than just a vacation destination for John McCain," the ad says over jaunty, Caribbean-style steel drum music. "McCain went to Bermuda, and while he was there pledged to protect tax breaks for American corporations that hide their profits offshore. And grateful insurance company executives and their lobbyists who benefit from the tax scheme gave McCain $50,000." We looked in detail at McCain's visit in this statement . Here we'll look at the campaign contributions angle. Bermuda, a British territory with significant autonomy, is home to many international companies seeking to avoid taxes. In 2006, there were 14,267 international companies registered in Bermuda, many of them American owned, according to the U.S. State Department. A 2004 GAO report also listed Bermuda as a tax haven. To come up with its $50,000 number, the Obama campaign compiled a list of 30 people and one political action committee connected to insurance and reinsurance companies based in Bermuda. We obtained a copy of the list from the campaign and cross-checked with Federal Election Commission records and found it to be accurate. It seems likely that the Obama campaign's numbers undercounted contributions from lobbyists connected to Bermuda-based insurance companies. We were able to independently document another $8,150 in contributions to McCain. And finally, among the Bermuda-connected contributors, we found four donors also gave a combined total of $8,200 to Obama. The timeline seems to be that McCain visited Bermuda in August 2007, a fundraiser for him was held in October (which he did not attend) and contributions were reported to the Federal Election Commission in November 2007 and afterward. The ad stops short of saying there was a quid pro quo at work, though we get the feeling the Obama campaign wouldn't mind if you assumed there was. A story in the Royal Gazette's sister newspaper Mid Ocean News noted that McCain's 2007 comments were at odds with comments he made in 2002 deploring companies moving overseas. McCain said then, "More and more U.S. companies are using this highly profitable accounting scheme that allows a company to move its legal residence to offshore tax havens such as Bermuda, where there is no corporate income tax, and shield its profits from taxes. I applaud efforts to discourage this practice." The McCain campaign responded to the Obama ad by pointing out that the Obama campaign rents office space from Accenture, which is based in Bermuda. The Chicago Sun-Times reported in 2007 that the Obama campaign was leasing the 11th floor of an office tower for its headquarters from Accenture. The company is based in Bermuda. The ad states that McCain got $50,000 from people connected to Bermuda-based companies, and we find this accurately portrays the contributions received. We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-06777	The "mega-rich" pay about 15 percent in taxes, while the middle class "fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/18/warren-buffett/warren-buffett-says-super-rich-pay-lower-taxes-oth/	It's not often you see someone stand up and say, "Tax me more!" Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, "Stop Coddling the Super-Rich." Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income. "While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks," he writes. As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent. "If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot," Buffett wrote. "To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot." Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that "the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot." Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us. Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions: • the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent; • the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent; • the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent; • the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent; • the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent; • the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent. Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on. Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap. Head hurt yet? Ours, too. Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends. Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as "carried interest" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers. Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that "the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes," while middle class taxpayers "fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot." He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent. On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back. One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries. So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True.	None	Warren Buffett	None	None	None	2011-08-18T12:01:21	2011-08-14	['None']

pomt-08369	"The Taliban has been there for years and years, I mean, hundreds of thousands of years."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/oct/25/kendrick-meek/meek-claims-taliban-have-been-afghanistan-hundreds/	In Florida's U.S. Senate race, a trio of politicians have traded barbs about each other's records and argued about Social Security, immigration and the economy. The issue of the war in Afghanistan has not been as prominent a campaign topic in this feisty race between Republican and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio, independent Gov. Charlie Crist and Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek. But in a nationally televised CNN debate at the University of South Florida in Tampa on Oct. 24, 2010, the candidates discussed the war in Afghanistan. CNN's Candy Crowley asked Meek, according to the transcript: "The basic question is, if the government of Afghanistan comes to some conclusion of this war in a deal with the Taliban, is that acceptable to you given the price in both blood and treasure that the U.S. has put in there?" Meek's response: "Unaccepting. Not accepting to -- acceptable to me. I think Pakistan should be also in this discussion when it comes down to monitoring the situation on the ground. The international community must be at the table because there's a lot of foreign affairs dollars that are going into Afghanistan. "I think the purse strings are going to dictate the deal. I think it's very, very important to understand that the Taliban has been there for years and years, I mean, hundreds of thousands of years. And I don't think that any -- you know, sitting down at a peace table is going to come about. "We cannot allow the very dangerous individuals that have brought about the true 9/11 to have a place of safety in Afghanistan on the Pakistan side. But I think diplomatic -- diplomacy is important and also predator drones." At another point during the debate, Meek said: "I'm the only candidate that's really talking about military families in this campaign. Folks want to talk about war; they want to talk about Afghanistan; they want to talk about Iraq. I'm the only person that's been there. I'm the only person that understands what these families are going through, who have committed their loved ones to war for the last 10 years, many of them the ages of these young people here in this audience." Meek's campaign spokesman Adam Sharon said Meek was referring to himself as the only Florida U.S. Senate candidate who has been to Afghanistan and Iraq. For this Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to check Meek's statement that the Taliban has been in Afghanistan for "hundreds of thousands of years." It's obvious that "hundreds of thousands of years" would take us back to well before the pyramids were built, so common sense tells us right away that Meek misspoke. But we were still curious about how long the Taliban had been around. We sent Meek's claim to two foreign policy experts: Michael Semple, a fellow at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard Kennedy School, and David Markey, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. We also spoke to Megan Mattson, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State. All three experts pointed us to the 1990s for the birth of the political force we know as the Taliban. Mattson said the Taliban rose to power in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s after the withdrawal of the Soviet Union forces. (The Soviets had invaded Afghanistan in late 1979 and withdrew 10 years later.) She referred us to background notes about Afghanistan on the state department's website which states: "The Taliban had risen to power in the mid-1990s in reaction to the anarchy and warlordism that arose after the withdrawal of Soviet forces. Many Taliban had been educated in madrassas in Pakistan and were largely from rural southern Pashtun backgrounds. In 1994, the Taliban developed enough strength to capture the city of Kandahar from a local warlord and proceeded to expand its control throughout Afghanistan, occupying Kabul in September 1996. By the end of 1998, the Taliban occupied about 90% of the country, limiting the opposition largely to a small mostly Tajik corner in the northeast and the Panjshir valley. .... From the mid-1990s the Taliban provided sanctuary to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi national who had fought with the mujahideen resistance against the Soviets, and provided a base for his and other terrorist organizations." Here is what Markey wrote to us in an e-mail: " 'Taliban' as a political movement is only decades old, was born out of the Afghan civil war in the 1990s and the breakdown in order that led a group of religious students ('talibs') to take up arms against rapacious, brutal warlords. Their success was assisted -- increasingly over time -- by radical groups and others, including Pakistani intelligence, until they eventually succeeded in taking over most of the country. I should note that 'Taliban,' as representatives of extremist Islam, could only be as old as Islam itself, which is hundreds, not thousands of years. The Pashtuns (ethnic group), from whom the Taliban are primarily drawn, have -- as far as I know -- lived in this region for thousands of years. But all Pashtuns are NOT Taliban, and this is clearly not what the Senate candidate said." Semple agreed in his e-mail: "The Taliban Movement (Tehreek Taliban) was founded in 1994. Any claim that as a movement they have been there longer is simply wrong." We asked Meek's spokesman for comment on the statement. Sharon said simply, "He misspoke." Meek clearly made a mid-debate stumble. He could have just stopped after saying that "the Taliban has been there for years and years" rather than adding "I mean, hundreds of thousands of years." But he made the comment on national TV, portrayed himself as the only one of the three who had been to Afghanistan (he notes his repeated trips to combat zones on his website) and claimed to be the only one talking about military families. So we felt his claim was fair game for a fact check. Meek's campaign does get credit for quickly acknowledging the error, but we rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12963	[Chicago is the] only city in the United States, you get a B average in high school, community college is free.	half-true	/illinois/statements/2016/dec/28/rahm-emanuel/fact-check-emanuels-claim-about-college-only-somew/	Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was live on more than 40 radio stations across Chicago with broadcast journalist Bill Kurtis last month talking about housing, crime and the presidential election. The discussion also turned toward education. "We (Chicago) are the only city where if you get a B average in high school, community college is free," Emanuel said. "I didn’t know that," Kurtis responded. Emanuel reiterated his claim, further explaining that Chicago was the only city in the United States to offer this incentive. Emanuel went on to say that if you keep the B average in community college, it was possible to get 30 percent to 40 percent off tuition for your remaining two years. Too good to be true? We decided to check it out. When we reached out to the Mayor’s Office for further comment, we were directed to a press release from May 2016. The release announced the Star Scholarship program, an initiative created by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chancellor Cheryl Hyman of the City Colleges of Chicago in 2014. The Star Scholarship Program Does the Star Scholarship program guarantee high school seniors with a B-average free community college? To an extent, but there are a few more qualifications. In order to qualify for the Star Scholarship program, a high school senior needs to have a GPA of 3.0 or higher, which is equivalent to a B. However, a high school senior also needs to be "completion ready," meaning students need to receive 17 or higher in math and English on the ACT. These qualifications go slightly beyond those outlined by Emanuel. And what about students who wish to continue on after their two years in community college? Will they get a 30 to 40 percent discount off their tuition? Maybe. It depends on which university or college the student applies to, and some institutions may also require "additional academic merits." As of the May press release, 15 four-year universities and colleges have become partners of the Star Scholarship program, with packages ranging from $2,500 to $50,000 per year. However, it is difficult to determine whether the 30 to 40 percent off figure quoted by Emanuel would be accurate in each student’s case. But is Chicago the only city to offer this? Another part of Emanuel’s claim was that Chicago was the "only city" in the United States to have a program like the Star Scholarship. However, a quick Google search revealed that this was not the case - Tennessee, Oregon, Minnesota, and Kentucky all have similar programs in place, which means students in cities in those states have access to such an incentive. When we emailed the Mayor’s Office enquiring about these other programs, we received a reply saying that Chicago was "the first city to leverage free community college for high school students." But when we looked at the programs’ establishments chronologically, Chicago does not appear to have been the first. Tennessee beat Chicago to the punch. In February 2014, Tennessee governor Bill Haslam announced the Tennessee Promise program during his State of the State address. The Tennessee Promise requires students to maintain at least a 2.0 GPA after being accepted into the program, and has some additional stipulations as well (such as community service). Emanuel did not announce Chicago’s Star Scholarship program until October 2014. Additionally, according to an article from the Chicago Tribune, Emanuel himself said "the city took a page from Tennessee's plan in developing the Star Scholarship." Our ruling Mayor Emanuel said, Chicago is the "only city in the United States, you get a B average in high school, community college is free." Chicago’s Star Scholarship program does allow students with a B average or higher to attend community college in the city for free. However, there are a few other requirements as well. In addition, contrary to what Mayor Emanuel stated, Chicago is not the only city to offer such a program. Other states, including Tennessee, Oregon, and Minnesota, and the cities within them, offer similar programs to high school students. While it is true a B average means you can go to community college for free in Chicago with some added requirements, Emanuel exaggerated his claim that Chicago is the only city in the nation to offer such an incentive. Therefore, we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-02199	"More than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months. This is more than the combined total of the nine years before."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/24/chain-email/chain-email-says-more-1000-american-soldiers-have-/	A reader recently sent us an email that had a meandering -- but strongly critical -- message of opposition to President Barack Obama. The email -- which can be read in its entirety here -- urges veterans and their families to vote in the 2014 midterm elections in order to send Obama a message. Here are excerpts: "The President, the Commander in Chief, has made the Rules of Engagement (ROE) so difficult that our troops are often killed before they can even get permission to fight," the email says. "Nothing has been done to stop our troops from being murdered by the Afghanis they are training, either. ... "Interestingly enough, when (George W. Bush) was president, you heard about the military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan almost daily. With Obama in the White House, the mainstream media has been strangely quiet. "More than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months. This is more than the combined total of the nine years before. Thirty have died in August. During the last month, over 50 additional NATO and US servicemen have been murdered, inside jobs by those who are hired to be a force for good in Afghanistan. "The commander in chief is AWOL. Not a peep, although he ordered the White House flag flown at half-staff for the Sikhs that were killed. There is a deep disgust, a fury, growing in the ranks of the military against the indifferent incompetence of this president." We will be checking a few claims from this email, but in this report, we’ll look at the claim that "more than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months. This is more than the combined total of the nine years before." To analyze this claim, we turned to iCasualties.org, which we have used before to calculate battlefield deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq. First, we looked at deaths over the most recent 27 months -- February 2012 to April 2014. Over that period, the total number of deaths for U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan was 427. The total for the nine years prior to that was 1,825. This makes the email clearly wrong. The 427 deaths is less than half the 1,000 claimed in the email. And the amount over the prior nine years was more than four times that number -- the opposite of what the email claimed. However, we think we know where the math came from. If the email was written in mid 2012, it would have been largely correct. Between June 2010 and August 2012, there were 1,020 American military fatalities. And in the nine years before that, there were 1,088. That’s close enough to be a reasonable estimate. (Further evidence in favor of this theory about when the email was written: In August 2012, there were 39 U.S. troops killed, not far from the email’s claim.) So at one time, the email was pretty close to accurate about the death statistics for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. However, its use of outdated numbers is problematic, since the email explicitly aims to persuade voters to send Obama a message in 2014. If you only rely on the information in the email, one would assume that U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan are spiraling out of control. In reality, the opposite is happening. After peaking in 2010 with 499 U.S. military deaths, the number has fallen to 418 in 2011, 310 in 2012, 127 in 2013 and 16 so far in 2014, which, if the current trend holds, would mean a falling number of deaths for the fourth consecutive year. In fact, in March 2014, there were zero deaths. So far in April 2014, there have been two. This is not surprising -- this is a war that Obama has pledged to wind down. (He hasn’t been entirely successful at achieving that yet; we have rated his promise to that effect In the Works.) Our ruling The chain email says that "more than 1,000 American soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan in the last 27 months. This is more than the combined total of the nine years before." This may have been accurate in mid 2012, but the statistics are now so out of date that the trend has actually reversed itself. U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan have been declining for the past four years. This matters because it contradicts the email’s dominant message -- that surging deaths in Afghanistan are a reason to vote against Obama’s Democratic allies in the 2014 midterm election.

pomt-05031	Sherrod Brown’s approval rating "has plummeted to 38 percent among Ohio voters" in a poll by a Democratic pollster.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/13/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-campaign-says-sherrod-browns-approval-/	Sen. Sherrod Brown has a challenge on his hands this November. How serious depends upon how one reads the polls and regards the money being spent against him by third-party groups. Brown is an incumbent Democrat. His Republican challenger, Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, says things are definitely looking bad for Brown and cites a survey from a Democratic pollster as proof. Mandel, in a fund-raising pitch sent by email on July 9, used the number 38 to make his case. The number represents "the number of years Sherrod Brown has been a career politician," Mandel said. But "38 is also Sherrod Brown’s approval rating in a recent poll conducted by a Democratic polling firm. "Yes, you read that correctly," Mandel continued. "His approval rating has plummeted to 38 percent among Ohio voters, and down to 33 percent among Independent voters!" That decline caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. Has Brown’s standing among voters dropped precipitously? Mandel’s campaign communications director, Travis Considine, pointed us to the poll his boss had mentioned. Published on June 27, the poll was conducted by Public Policy Polling, a Raleigh, N.C., firm that represents Democratic candidates but that also conducts polling for general consumption. We turned to that poll, and to other surveys from PPP, as it is known. A news release accompanying the latest PPP poll actually had a headline quite different from Mandel’s point. The headline said, "Sen. Brown holds steady, Kasich already in trouble." The first paragraph in the news release announcing the results said, "Despite steady increases in name recognition for Republican challenger Josh Mandel, incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown continues to hold onto a modest lead in his first re-election bid." In this automated telephone poll, conducted June 21 to June 24, Brown led Mandel by 7 percentage points. This meant that Brown’s lead had dropped by only 1 point in a month despite ads from the Mandel campaign and groups that support him. Furthermore, PPP reported, "Independents support Brown over Mandel 43-34. There’s more, most of it supporting Brown. "Sherrod Brown continues to lead the contest by a healthy margin," the PPP release concluded. Wait a minute. Didn’t Mandel’s fund-raising email suggest otherwise? Read the language closely. Mandel did not pick a number reflecting how voters would have decided if the vote had been in late June. Those are the so-called horse race numbers we mentioned above that are important for getting a sense of where the race stands at any given time. But in the PPP poll, 15 percent of Ohio voters were still undecided.This is why other poll questions mattered. For instance, what do voters think of the job Brown is doing in the Senate? Those job-approval ratings can be important because they suggest potential weakness or strength as the campaign season continues. Mandel’s would not be the first campaign to look for an opponent’s weakness, spotlight it and then try to close the sale by offering voters an alternative. Thus, the PPP poll question Mandel cited: "Do you approve or disapprove of Senator Sherrod Brown’s job performance?" The answer, from a sample of 673 Ohioans who voted in at least one of the last three general elections (2006, 2008 and 2010): 38 percent approve. 42 percent disapprove. 18 percent are not sure. Given the poll’s 3.8 percentage-point margin of error, that difference between approval and disapproval is small -- perhaps inconsequential. But Mandel focused on other points, too. He looked at changes in Brown’s approval ratings since January. To better understand, we ran out the numbers from a series of PPP polls. Consider: Brown had a 42 percent job approval rating in a PPP poll conducted Jan. 28 and 29. His disapproval rating was 34. By early May, his approval had dropped by 2 points, still inside the margin of error, while his disapproval rating rose by a mere single digit. No noteworthy changes, in other words. Then came the latest PPP poll. It coincided with an advertising push by Mandel as well as that of outside business and conservative groups that have spent more than $10 million in hopes of ousting Brown. The latest PPP poll put Brown’s approval rating at 38 percent. His disapproval had grown to 42 percent, Put those together -- the 4-point drop in approval and the 8-point rise in disapproval since January -- and it means that Brown’s approval ratings "have suffered a net loss of 12 points," Considine told us. Is it fair to put those numbers together to get to a 12-point loss? PPP director Tom Jensen told us yes. "That’s how we would usually do it," he said. It’s important to note that this is only one poll. We looked at the trend for Brown’s job approval this year in polls by Quinnipiac University, and unlike PPP, Quinnipiac showed a barely perceptible change of a single digit in each direction. But Mandel was specific. He clearly referred to "a recent poll conducted by a Democratic polling firm." So there was a drop. And it’s fair to consider it a 12-point drop on net, says the pollster. That brings us to a final point of consideration: Has Brown’s approval rating "plummeted," as Mandel said? "I wouldn’t describe it as a plummet," Jensen said. "Both Brown’s and Mandel’s numbers have gotten worse" as the two go after one another. Karlyn Bowman, an impartial polling expert at the Washington think tank American Enterprise Institute, suggested the use of "plummet" is best left to wordsmiths. "If I was looking at these numbers for Obama, I wouldn’t use the word ‘plummet,’ but it certainly is a significant change," Bowman said. Our Webster’s dictionary describes "plummet" as a sharp and abrupt drop. Most of the changes in Brown’s approval ratings occurred over little more than a month. Polls are best read over the course of time, but Brown’s drop in this one is relatively quick. So Mandel’s statement is accurate. But it bears noting that while he correctly cited data that showed Brown’s approval rating had declined, the poll wasn’t full of good news for Mandel, either. PPP found that only 24 percent of Ohio voters held a favorable opinion of Mandel. That’s still better than the 14 percent he got in January. Most voters then didn’t have an opinion of him. Conversely, 39 percent of Ohio voters held an unfavorable view of Mandel in late June -- 14 points worse than in January, PPP data show. So both these candidates might have a problem. And Mandel’s numbers left out the question that may matter most: For whom would you vote? He was selective in his data, ignoring the top line of the PPP finding that said Brown "holds steady" in his lead. The latest Quinnipiac poll gave Brown a whopping 16-point lead in the horse race. In this context, you’d expect a politician to choose his best data, however selective. Mandel’s statement omits additional information that provides clarity. But the numbers he chose were accurate, despite the rhetoric. That’s why we rate Mandel’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-04833	"(Brendan) Doherty wants to raise the eligibility age for Social Security benefits for anyone born after 1960, with no regard for the challenges it would cause for people working in physically demanding occupations."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/15/david-cicilline/says-brendan-doherty-wants-raise-social-security-e/	First-term Democratic Congressman David Cicilline has been circulating a campaign flier attacking Republican Brendan Doherty over the issue of Social Security reform. The two-column flier draws a contrast between the candidates over one of the most pressing issues facing Washington: how to keep the Social Security trust fund from running dry in the next 20 years. In one column, there is this statement: "David will continue to fight against any efforts to privatize Social Security or reduce benefits." The opposing column states: "Doherty wants to raise the eligibility age for Social Security benefits for anyone born after 1960, with no regard for the challenges it would cause for people working in physically demanding occupations." Doherty, the former head of the Rhode Island State Police, has said that raising the retirement age of Americans born around 1960 is worth considering. It’s the second part of that sentence that caught PolitiFact’s attention: "with no regard for the challenges it would cause for people working in physically demanding occupations." Had Doherty said that? The flier states as its source an appearance Doherty made on "Newsmakers" on Channel 12 (WPRI) -- though it cites the broadcast date inaccurately. (It says "3/10/2010." The show actually aired March 11, 2012.) Raising the eligibility age of Social Security recipients -- it’s now 67 for those born in 1960 or later -- has been talked about since at least 2010 when a bipartisan budget commission appointed by President Obama considered it. Mr. Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to propose ways to balance the federal budget by 2015. It became known as the Simpson-Bowles commission after its two co-chairmen: former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson, of Wyoming, and Democrat Erskine Bowles, former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton. As part of its suggestion to raise the eligibility age, the Simpson-Bowles report specifically calls for a hardship exemption for people who work physically demanding jobs, such as fishermen or construction workers. Their strenuous professions would probably force them to retire by 62, the report says, and they would need retirement income when they do. During the "Newsmakers" interview, Doherty is asked a general question about what kinds of changes might people expect in Social Security coverage 10 years from now. Doherty uses the opportunity to first reiterate that he would protect the benefits of seniors and those about to enter the system but "down the road we need to look at Social Security .... I believe there are some good talking points in Simpson-Bowles." Doherty is never asked any specific questions about how he feels about hardship exemptions nor does he bring up the issue, a point Ted Nesi, one of the show’s co-hosts, made last week in a blog post. When we asked Cicilline’s campaign for any other evidence of Doherty’s position, campaign manager Eric Hyers said Doherty’s lack of specific mention of the hardship exemptions shows he doesn’t support them and has "no regard for the challenges" of those who work in physically demanding jobs. The flier "is 100 percent accurate," Hyers contends. "He has talked many, many times about raising the age of Social Security," said Hyers. "Never once has he talked about these exemptions. ... If this was a serious concern of his it would have come up." Besides, Hyers said, the flier doesn’t actually say Doherty "opposes an exemption. It only says he has not made a point to speak about it." (In fact, the flier says Doherty wants to raise the eligibility raise "with no regard" for physically challenging jobs.) We asked the Doherty camp whether their candidate had ever in the past specifically mentioned whether he supported the hardship exemption. Just one reference would undeniably show that the Cicilline campaign was wrong. Doherty campaign manager Robert Coupe said he didn’t think so because Doherty always talks about Social Security "in terms of the Simpson-Bowles proposal and this [the hardship exemptions] is part of it. "Just because you don’t specifically say something doesn’t mean you can say they have no regard for it. That’s like asking us to disprove a negative." Our ruling A David Cicilline campaign flier says Brendan Doherty wants to raise the eligibility age for Social Security benefits for anyone born after 1960 "with no regard for the challenges it would cause for people working in physically demanding occupations." But the Cicilline campaign provided no evidence that Doherty ever espoused that position. Attacking someone for what he hasn’t specifically said -- that he supports the exemption -- defies logic, particularly since Doherty says he does support the Simpson-Bowles proposal, which would include the hardship exemptions if the eligibility age is raised. We rate the statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-03352	Farming is "one of the fastest growing areas of our economy."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/18/lincoln-chafee/governor-lincoln-chafee-says-farming-one-fastest-g/	While munching on a raw carrot stick last month, we noticed a quote in a Providence Journal story from Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee regarding the importance of farming in Rhode Island. "Fifteen years ago, you wouldn’t have thought that farming would be an important part of the Rhode Island economy, but it’s one of the fastest growing areas of our economy," Chafee said. "Restaurants are looking for fresh food, and so times change and we have to adapt to that." We know the so-called "farm to table" movement -- the use of locally sourced foodstuffs -- has taken root here. But in our travels around the state, we still don’t see many farms. Is farming really growing as quickly as Chafee said? It seemed that it would be simple to find out. But a search for information took us on a frustrating odyssey through five state agencies and offices and two federal departments. We began with an e-mail to Christine Hunsinger, Chafee’s communications director, asking for the governor’s backup. She cited U.S. Department of Agriculture data from 2007 -- the latest available -- that shows the number of farms in Rhode Island had increased from 858 to 1,219 between 2002 and 2007, a 42 percent increase. A farm is defined as "any place from which $1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced and sold" in a year. Impressive, yes. But just because the number of farms increased by that rate, it doesn’t mean that the overall economic impact of farming increased at the same rate. The report doesn’t say whether the new farms were substantial or only large gardens. And there are no comparisons with other sectors of the economy. We called the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, but a spokesman said the corporation had no statistics regarding the economic profile of farming. We also contacted the Division of Agriculture of the state Department of Environmental Management, where division chief Kenneth Ayars directed us to "The Economic Impact Study of Plant-Based Industries and Agriculture in Rhode Island." University of Rhode Island researchers estimated in the study that agriculture, which they defined to include plant crops and animal production as well as nurseries, greenhouses, floriculture and sod production, generated $170.6 million in gross sales in 2012. The study was motivated, in part, by critics’ contention that federal government statistics understate Rhode Island farming. But it was only a snapshot and didn’t tell whether agriculture is growing, shrinking or static. In a second e-mail, Hunsinger referred us to the U.S. Census for the same period as the USDA data, 2002-2007. Unlike the USDA, the Census compared farming to 18 other business sectors in Rhode Island as defined by the North American Industry Classification System. That is a standard used by federal statistical agencies to analyze the economy. The 42 percent increase in the number of farms did, indeed, place farming in the upper ranks of our economy -- if all you are counting are places that call themselves farms. During the period in question, only one sector, management businesses, grew its numbers by a larger percentage, from 120 to 175, or 45.8 percent, according to the U.S. Census. The worst was manufacturing, where the number of businesses shrank from 2,131 to 1,825, or minus 14.4 percent. Ultimately, we found the most timely data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks the nation’s economic output with the famous measure called the Gross Domestic Product, and also reports on each of the Gross State Products. According to its report, "Regional Data; Real GDP by state," during the most recent five-year period available, from 2007 through 2011, Rhode Island’s gross product from crop and animal production fell from $27 million to $17 million, adjusted for inflation, or by 37 percent. The gross product is the total value of goods and services produced annually. If you define the industry more broadly, under the federal classification system, as "agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting," the picture is still negative. It contracted during the period, from $74 million to $67 million. This was a time of economic stagnation in Rhode Island. And by this measure, contrary to Chafee’s impression, farming was withering, not growing. In fact, if you accept the federal figures, it was next to last among the 19 Rhode Island business sectors identified under the federal classification system. Only mining, which plummeted 52.9 percent, was worse. The leading sector was Information, including data processing and telecommunications, with 34.9 percent growth. Our ruling Governor Lincoln Chafee said that farming is "one of the fastest growing areas" of the Rhode Island economy. Six-year-old figures cited by Chafee’s spokeswoman did show an increase in the number of farms in Rhode Island. But fresher and more relevant figures on Rhode Island from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that the economic value of farming has actually fallen in recent years. The judges rule Chafee’s statement Mostly False.	None	Lincoln Chafee	None	None	None	2013-07-18T00:01:10	2013-06-05	['None']

pomt-00836	"Whales live as long at SeaWorld" as they do in the wild.	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/24/seaworld/seaworld-says-their-whales-live-long-wild-whales-d/	More and more, critics are making the case that keeping killer whales in captivity is harmful to the animals and dangerous for the people who train them. SeaWorld, the theme park that showcases the trained whales, is now fighting back. A new ad, part of a multimedia blitz for the company, is headlined, "Fact: Whales live as long at SeaWorld," and it is written in the voice of Chris Dold, a SeaWorld veterinarian. The ad, which has appeared in the Tampa Bay Times, takes specific aim at criticism leveled by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, an animal-rights group that has been among the theme park company’s biggest critics. Here’s a portion of the ad’s text: "You might have heard attacks from PETA saying our killer whales live only a fraction as long as whales in the wild. They say, ‘In captivity, orcas’ average life span plummets to just nine years.’ But the author of an independent study, Dr. Douglas DeMaster, of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying, ‘Survival in the wild is comparable to survival in captivity.’ There’s no other way to say it… PETA is not giving you the facts." PETA, meanwhile, pushed back against the ad’s conclusions, citing the average age of whales that have died since 1965. According to PETA’s documentation of captive whale deaths, the average age of death is 12 years old for SeaWorld’s female orcas -- which are expected to survive in the wild for about 50 years. For males -- which are expected to survive in the wild for 30 years -- the average age of death is 16. SeaWorld currently has in its care several whales in their 30s and one in its 40s. Keeping whales in captivity is a complicated issue, and the critical 2013 documentary Blackfish has brought more attention to it. Clearly, longevity is just one factor, and it isn’t the same thing as the quality of the whales’ daily lives. Here, though, we wanted to drill down on SeaWorld’s specific claim that the whales at their parks live just as long as they do in the wild. SeaWorld’s evidence We posed SeaWorld’s claim to DeMaster, the scientist quoted in the ad. He’s the science director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, an office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a federal government agency. Most of the independent experts we contacted agreed that DeMaster is the key scientist to ask about this issue. DeMaster said that SeaWorld is correct -- "as long as you use data from 2005 to 2013." (PETA’s data, by contrast, goes back 40 more years.) On three occasions -- in 1988, 1995 and 2013 -- DeMaster has compiled data that comprehensively compared survival among captive and wild marine mammals. In the 1988 and 1995 papers, DeMaster found differences in the survival rates of marine mammals, including killer whales (also called orcas), depending on whether they lived in the wild or in captivity. The 1995 paper, for instance, found that captive orcas had a 94 percent chance of surviving to the next year in captivity, compared to 98 percent in the wild. That changed by the time DeMaster completed his latest research, in 2013. By then, he found, the annual survival rate for both captive and non-captive killer whales had converged at 98 percent. "According to recent information there was an improvement in the annual survival rate, to quite close to what you might see in the wild," DeMaster told PolitiFact. DeMaster cautioned that he’s not sure of the reason for the improvement in survival, and he said he doesn’t take a position on whether or not large mammals should be kept in captivity. Meanwhile, an Associated Press analysis also cited in the SeaWorld ad -- which is based on the same data DeMaster used, the federal government’s Marine Mammal Inventory Report -- found that the average life expectancy for a killer whale born at SeaWorld was 46 years, which it said was close to the 49-year average life expectancy of a wild orca. Critiquing the SeaWorld evidence So SeaWorld has support for its claim. But the company glosses over some important caveats. • None of the statistical comparisons take into account quality of life, as opposed to length of life. Science is better at measuring longevity than it is at judging how humane a life in captivity is. The mathematical approach "is totally irrelevant," said Dave Duffus, an associate professor of geography at Canada's University of Victoria, who participated on the panel with DeMaster in New Zealand. "To me the important variable is not how long, rather it is how well, which isn’t a scientific question as much as it is a logical question. Everything about the quality of captive life is in opposition to the wild, which is the product of thousands of generations of natural selection." • Merely reaching parity with wild populations isn’t necessarily a major achievement. Simple logic would suggest several reasons why marine mammals should live longer in captivity. Captive animals don’t have to worry about predators, food shortages, fishing nets, or pollution, and they’re given nutritional supplements, vaccines and veterinary care. "It would sort of make sense that any animal given better medical and nutritional care would live just as long, or longer, than one not given this sort of care," said Paul Nachtigall, director of the Marine Mammal Research Program at the University of Hawaii. • The ad focuses on longevity, not survival rates; those are different statistics. The ad’s headline refers to how long whales live, and the text uses terms like "life span" and "life expectancy." But those are different things than the statistic DeMaster used that’s favorable to SeaWorld -- annual survival rates. Many experts, including DeMaster, told PolitiFact that annual survival rates are better measurements than longevity. Whales have not been in captivity long enough to know whether they are able to live a full-length life in that setting, DeMaster told PolitiFact. They’ve only been in captivity since the 1960s. Jaap van der Toom, a Dutch biologist who has studied marine mammals, has made a similar point. "Longevity is basically an incidental finding: it is determined by the oldest animal you find in your sample," he has written. "You can only determine the longevity of a group of animals after all the members of that group have died." Well before SeaWorld released its ad, van der Toom published a cheat sheet about how to spin statistics. Referring to the same group of animals, he said, you could use different statistics to paint opposite appraisals. "If you want to paint a positive picture," you could say that "the life expectancy is 19.5 years" or "the majority of the animals will become older than 13 years," he wrote. In effect, that’s the approach SeaWorld took. But if you wanted to offer a negative spin, you would say that "within five years, 23 percent of the animals will have died," or that "one-third of the animals will survive no longer than eight years," or "within 14 years, 50 percent of the animals will be dead." Van der Toom summed up: "To paraphrase an old song: " ‘t ain't what you say, it's the way that you say it." • The data on wild orca populations is sparse. There is data on whale life spans from the Pacific Northwest, but there are orcas all over the world, and there’s no guarantee that all of them have similar life spans and survival rates. In the 1995 paper, DeMaster cautioned that "comparisons between survival in captivity with survival in the wild will remain tenuous until additional demographic studies are conducted on wild populations." Our ruling A SeaWorld ad said "whales live as long at SeaWorld" as they do in the wild. At its core, this claim is an oversimplification of a much more complex issue. Recent independent data suggests that survival rates for captive and wild orcas are about equal, but that by itself isn't all that significant, experts told us. The data is limited and comparisons between orcas in captivity and in the wild are tenuous. Experts also noted that logic suggests captive whales should live longer because they don't face predators and receive medical care, which makes SeaWorld's claim further misleading. Lastly, experts said that a simple measurement of survival rates (or lifespan) serves as a smokescreen from the more fundamental question of the conditions for whales in captivity. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	SeaWorld	None	None	None	2015-03-24T12:40:08	2015-03-24	['None']
pomt-07521	Says President Obama's "grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-president-obamas-grandmother-cau/	It's early, but Donald Trump is emerging as a significant player in the Republican race for president. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that among people planning to vote in the Republican primary, Trump placed second, tied with Mike Huckabee and behind Mitt Romney. On MSNBC's Morning Joe on April 7, 2011, former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell warned, however, that Trump's economic commentary is being "trivialized" by his association with the so-called birthers, people who doubt that President Barack Obama is a natural-born citizen of the United States, and is therefore ineligible to serve as president, because he has not provided a copy of his original birth certificate. "Get off the birther stuff," Rendell said. Trump, who is considering a run for president, said in a telephone interview on the program that he would not back off the issue, and that over the last few weeks he has only become more skeptical that Obama was born in the U.S. (His campaign released a Certification of Live Birth, which Hawaii officials say is an official birth certificate and sufficient to prove he was born in Honolulu. Trump and others have said that is not sufficient and that they still have doubts. We've gone over this ground repeatedly at PolitiFact.) Trump also defended his position, saying, "His grandmother in Kenya said, 'Oh no, he was born in Kenya and I was there and I witnessed the birth.' Now, she's on tape and I think that tape's going to be produced fairly soon ...The grandmother in Kenya is on record saying he was born in Kenya." Trump made an identical claim in a Today Show interview the same morning: "His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth, okay?" This is actually an old claim that has been bouncing around the Internet for years. But keeping up with the latest birther claims is often like playing Whac-A-Mole, and we never got around to this one. So here we go. The claim is based on an Oct. 16, 2008, telephone call between Bishop Ron McRae of the Anabaptist Churches of North America and Sarah Obama of Kenya, Barack Obama's elderly step-grandmother. The interview is complicated by the addition of at least one translator, because Sarah Obama, then 86, spoke Swahili. The edited portion that often makes the rounds on the Internet includes this part of the interview: McRae: "Could I ask her about his actual birthplace? I would like to see his birthplace when I come to visit Kenya in December. Was she present when he was born in Kenya?" "She says yes she was. She was present when Obama was born," said the translator. Smoking gun? Only if you stop the tape there and don't listen to the rest of the interview. McRae immediately followed up by saying, "Okay, when I come in December, I would like to go by the place, the hospital where he was born. Could you tell me where he was born? Was he born in Mombasa?" The translator can be heard translating, and then, he said, "No. Obama was not born in Mombasa. He was born in America." Said McRae: "Whereabouts was he born? I thought he was born in Kenya." The response came back, "He was born in America, not in Mombasa." "Do you know where he was born?" McRae continued. "I thought he was born in Kenya. I was gonna go by and see where he was born." "Hawaii. She says he was born in Hawaii," the translator said. "In the state of Hawaii, where his father, his father was also learning there. The state of Hawaii." "I thought she said she was present," McRae said. "Was she able to see him being born in Hawaii?'' "No, no," the translator said. "...She was not ... she was here in Kenya. Obama was born in America ... Because the grandmother was back in Kenya and Obama was born in America, where he is from, where his father was learning, learning in America, the United States." Listen to the full conversation yourself. The parts in question begin about the 4:20 mark. McRae -- who we should emphasize was not the translator -- has kept the theory alive. In a Dec. 5, 2008 article, Salon ran an affidavit from McRae in which he maintains Sarah Obama confirmed she witnessed Obama's birth in Kenya: "Though some few younger relatives, including Mr. Ogombe (one of the translators), have obviously been versed to counter such facts with the common purported information from the American news media that Obama was born in Hawaii, Ms. Sarah Hussein Obama was very adamant that her grandson, Senator Barack Hussein Obama, was born in Kenya, and that she was present and witnessed his birth in Kenya, not the United States. When Mr. Ogombe attempted to counter Sarah Obama's clear responses to the question, verifying the birth of Senator Obama in Kenya, I asked Mr. Ogombe, how she could be present at Barack Obama's birth if the Senator was born in Hawaii, but Ogombe would not answer the question, instead he repeatedly tried to insert that, "No, No, No. He was born in the United States!" That's not what we heard on the tape. What we heard was a very rough translation in which an elderly woman agreed to the leading question that Obama was born in Kenya and that she was present. But it was immediately and clearly corrected -- repeatedly. When we contacted Trump’s organization, Michael Cohen, his political aide, referred us to Jerome R. Corsi, author of The Obama Nation: Leftist Politics and the Cult of Personality, which makes a case against Obama, calling him a political extremist who associates with radicals and has disturbing connections to Islam. (PolitiFact found the book was riddled with errors). In a brief telephone interview with PolitiFact, Corsi said he has spoken to Trump and that the statement about Obama's grandmother was, in fact, based on her taped conversation with McRae. Corsi pointed us toward an article he wrote for the conservative WorldNetDaily, in which he says that he spoke to two unnamed Kenyans familiar with Sarah Obama's dialect, and that they claimed she was clear in saying that she witnessed Obama's birth in Kenya. Futhermore, Corsi said they told him it appeared her later efforts to recant appeared to be heavily coached by those around her. Corsi has a book questioning Obama's birthplace coming out next month. We note that in a Chicago Tribune story in March 2007, national correspondent Tim Jones wrote that in an interview with Sarah Obama, she said she received the news of Obama's birth via a letter to her in Kenya and that she was "was so happy to have a grandchild in the U.S." Trump is serving up re-heated leftovers that have long ago been debunked. Anyone who listens to the tape of the phone conversation with Sarah Obama can hear how tightly you need to edit this interview to present it as evidence of a presidential cover-up. We rule Trump's claim that Obama's grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya False. Addendum: While researching this story, we sent an e-mail seeking comment from Bishop Ron McRae, who conducted the trans-Atlantic interview with Sarah Obama. We received this letter from McRae after our story published. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/96d0c18c-2c04-40d8-83c6-54cfbbfbc004	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2011-04-07T19:35:29	2011-04-07	['Kenya', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-14112	"Russ Feingold got a memo in 2009 that outlined veteran harm" at a Wisconsin VA facility "and nothing was done."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/11/freedom-partners-action-fund/attack-ad-says-ex-us-sen-russ-feingold-got-2009-me/	In unveiling an attack ad against Democrat Russ Feingold, who is challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in a rematch of their 2010 contest, a group backing Johnson said it was spending $2 million to air the TV spot. The central claim in the ad from the Freedom Partners Action Fund -- a Super PAC whose funders include billionaire industrialists Charles Koch and Wisconsin’s Diane Hendricks -- is that then-senator Feingold received a memo in 2009 detailing serious problems at the VA Medical Center in Tomah, Wis. Deaths of veterans were later linked to the over-prescription of painkillers at the facility. But there are several issues with the ad: The person who wrote the memo -- and added a notation saying it was hand delivered to Feingold -- reversed herself several months before the ad was released, saying the memo never had been delivered to Feingold after all. After the ad began running, three Wisconsin television stations pulled it when Feingold’s campaign demanded it be taken down for being inaccurate. Then Freedom Partners produced a new version of its ad. This time, the ad didn't say Feingold received the memo; instead it said the memo was marked as having been delivered. Whether Feingold ever received the memo seven years ago may never be known. Freedom Partners points out it is relying on the memo writer’s original contention that Feingold did receive it. But -- as Freedom Partners itself seems to confirm by revising its ad -- there isn’t evidence that Feingold did receive the memo. The ad The original ad, titled "The Real Story," was posted online May 2, 2016. It features whistleblower Ryan Honl, a former employee at the Veterans Administration clinic in Tomah, which is about 100 miles northwest of Madison. Honl describes falsified records and other problems at the clinic, then makes the accusation about Feingold. "I found out that Russ Feingold got a memo in 2009 that outlined veteran harm and nothing was done," Honl says. As he speaks, a copy of the memo appears on the screen. The focus is the hand-written notation that says the memo was hand-delivered to Feingold and two other Wisconsin Democrats -- U.S. Rep. Ron Kind and then-Rep. Dave Obey. Animation is used to draw a red circle around Feingold’s name. Honl continues, saying: "Russ Feingold ignored veterans' concerns while veterans were dying at the facility. All those veterans who’ve come back wounded, and they die at the hands of politicians who look the other way. I just want the voters to know the real story." The memo The memo was revealed by USA Today in October 2015, after it had been reported that a 35-year-old Marine died at the facility in 2014 after doctors prescribed him a fatal mixture of drugs. The memo was written by Lin Ellinghuysen, president of a local union at Tomah, to another union official. "(M)any of the veterans served at this facility are prescribed large quantities of narcotics," she wrote, adding that it had become a "significant" and "serious" concern. But Obey and representatives of Kind and Feingold told USA Today they had no recollection -- or record of -- receiving the 2009 memo. Obey told the newspaper that such correspondence would have been destroyed when members of Congress leave office. In addition, Ellinghuysen told USA Today "we can't confirm" the memos were delivered to the three offices and that she had "mistakenly operated on that assumption." Ellinghuysen has since gone further, stating to PolitiFact Wisconsin that the memo was not delivered to Feingold or Kind. She said the union official she sent the memo to told her he did not make the deliveries. Ellinghuysen also said that "after the untrue accusatory stories were out in the media about my 2009 memo smearing Feingold, I felt responsible" and made a donation to Feingold’s campaign. She said she recalled the amount was $50. The aftermath The memo has continued to be used in the run-up to the November 2016 election. But no evidence of whether Feingold received it has emerged. In January 2016, the Wisconsin Republican Party released audio of an interview Ellinghuysen did with a local sheriff’s deputy in 2009. She says on the recording that she had spoken to members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation in 2008 and they were aware of "unreported, unexpected deaths" at the VA hospital. But the recording doesn’t say who exactly Ellinghuysen talked to in Washington. And in any case, it doesn’t bear on whether Feingold received the memo cited in the Freedom Partners ad. In May 2016, after the three TV stations stopped running the Freedom Partners ad, the group released its revised version of the ad. In the new version, Honl says multiple memos outlining veteran harm, including the one from 2009, were marked delivered to Feingold and nothing was done. That’s a key change. The original ad states Feingold received the 2009 memo. The revised ad refers to multiple memos, but claims only they were marked as being received by Feingold (and the marking was done by the memo writer). Our rating Freedom Partners says in a TV ad that Feingold "got a memo in 2009 that outlined veteran harm" at a Wisconsin VA facility "and nothing was done." Whether the memo was ever delivered to Feingold, who was then a U.S. senator, may never be known. But Freedom Partners cites no evidence that it was delivered. And it made a revised version of the ad that essentially walks back its claim, now saying the memo was marked as delivered, not that Feingold actually received it. Because there isn’t evidence that Feingold received the memo, we rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9d1ab762-f258-4863-ab1d-b609bd97e49a	None	Freedom Partners Action Fund	None	None	None	2016-05-11T05:00:00	2016-05-02	['Wisconsin', 'Russ_Feingold']
pomt-00456	"U.S. government reports record tax haul after Trump tax cuts spur economic growth."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/17/patriot-news-alerts/did-us-have-record-tax-haul-after-trump-tax-cuts-s/	One of President Donald Trump’s favorite talking points is to tout the economic impact of the tax cut bill he signed into law last December. Web posts at friendly outlets have taken up the rallying cry. One of those sites was Patriot News Alerts, a site that says it opposes "the Deep State, the liberal media, social-justice Hollywood, leftist colleges." One post was headlined, "U.S. government reports record tax haul after Trump tax cuts spur economic growth." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the story is pegged to a real number, but not a number that holds up well to close scrutiny. (Our inquiry to the website was not answered.) The underlying data point is "very misleading," said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The body of the Patriot News Alerts article said, "For the first 10 months of the 2018 fiscal year, the federal government has collected a record amount of income and corporate taxes. … As Trump promised, more people are going back to work. That being the case, the government is collecting more money in income taxes from citizens." This number comes from the most recent monthly Treasury report through July 2018. The report organizes its data based on the fiscal year, so the 2018 numbers include 10 months -- from October 2017 to July 2018. According to the report, individual income tax receipts were up by 7.8 percent compared to the equivalent 10-month period in 2017. So that provides some support for the claim. But the same Treasury report shows that corporate taxes were down during the first 10 months of the fiscal year. In fact, they were down by 28.5 percent -- a whopping plunge, but not a surprising one, given the sweeping corporate tax cuts included in the new law. Total receipts, which include individual and corporate income taxes as well as estate taxes, excise taxes, and tariff duties, were up between the first 10 months of 2017 and the first 10 months of 2018. The rise was modest -- less than 1 percent -- but it was an increase. Still, there are several other concerns undermine the significance of the finding. A rise in tax collections is to be expected every year, barring a recession Every year, the U.S. population grows, and -- except during a recession -- the size of the economy grows, too. "So you’d expect receipts to be higher every year, all other things equal," said Benjamin R. Page, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. We compiled a chart showing the year-to-year changes in receipts from individual income taxes (in blue), corporate taxes (in red), and all other receipts (in yellow). The data, from 2008 to 2018, comes from the archive of monthly Treasury reports and includes only the first 10 months of the fiscal year, in order to keep it comparable to the data cited in the articles we’re checking. The chart shows that receipts sagged during the recession years of 2009 and 2010 but have otherwise risen steadily. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com If you look at the data in a more useful way -- the percentage increases from year to year, rather than the raw dollars taken in -- the chart shows that other years have exceeded Trump’s 10-month performance between 2017-18. Three times, President Barack Obama presided over double-digit annual increases in individual tax receipts: up 23.8 percent between 2010-11, up 17.4 percent between 2012-13, and up 11.6 percent between 2014-15. It’s not clear that the Trump tax cuts caused the increase in tax collections If you look at when the tax bill passed, it’s not clear at all that an increase in tax receipts followed the bill’s passage. Because the Treasury report also includes month-by-month data, it’s possible to drill down to measure trends during more specific time periods. For the three months of fiscal 2018 prior to the tax cut, individual income tax collections rose by 10.8 percent over the equivalent period from 2017. But the rise for the seven months after the tax cut was 6.7 percent. And if you look at total tax collections from every category, rather than just individual income taxes, the picture is even worse. During the seven-month period after the tax bill passed, total receipts actually fell slightly compared to the equivalent period in 2017, by about a tenth of a percentage point. Perhaps the most revealing comparison takes in the May-to-July period, because it excludes the spike in payments in April, when most Americans pay taxes on income generated in 2017, before the tax law was passed. During that period, individual income tax collections fell by about 1 percent compared to 2017. "I don’t have a great story for why individual receipts are up so much, but I don’t think it means what Patriot News Alerts thinks it means," Page said. Our ruling Patriot News Alerts said, "U.S. government reports record tax haul after Trump tax cuts spur economic growth." One notable category of tax receipts, individual income taxes, did rise in fiscal 2018, and total tax receipts rose by a smaller amount. But the closer you look, the less meaningful these statistics become. In particular, the data doesn’t provide support for the idea that the Trump tax bill juiced tax collections. If you drill down further to periods when the new tax law was in effect, individual income tax receipts actually fell compared to 2017. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-14204	"Steve Santarsiero wrote PA’s Gun Safety Law."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/21/steve-santarsiero/claim-bucks-lawmakers-gun-law-mailer-isnt-exactly-/	Pennsylvania laws that govern gun safety regulations were written by state legislators for decades before Steve Santarsiero was elected to a state House seat. But the Bucks County state representative who’s now a candidate for Congress is taking credit for legislation that governs gun safety in Pennsylvania. A mailer sent by his campaign claims Santarsiero, a Democrat running for a seat in the eighth congressional district, "wrote PA’s Gun Safety Law." Pennsylvania doesn’t have a law named for gun safety. So we decided to look a little deeper into Santarsiero’s gun-related claims to see which law his campaign was touting. The ad goes on to state: "After the shooting at Sandy Hook, Steve said ‘enough is enough’ and wrote legislation to close the background check loophole on gun sales and introduced a bill to stop those on the federal terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms in Pennsylvania." That’s true, but neither of those bills were passed into law. Santarsiero’s campaign manager Eric Goldman said the campaign "should have more clearly stated he has been fighting for it to become law," but added the mailer was not "intentionally misleading." He said other mailers and television ads on the issue referred to the legislation as a bill or a proposed law. While Pennsylvania law currently requires background checks for gun purchases from licensed dealers and for the private sale of handguns, Santarsiero’s background check bill would have added a stipulation that private sales of long guns are also subject to a background checks. He first introduced his background checks bill in 2013 and reintroduced it in 2015, but the bill has never been brought to a vote and was last referred to the House Judiciary Committee in October 2015. Similarly, a bill Santarsiero was the prime sponsor of last year would have prohibited the sale of firearms to anyone currently on the federal terrorist watch list, including no-fly lists. That bill was never brought to a vote and was last referred to the House Judiciary Committee in January. In addition to those gun safety-related bills authored by Santarsiero, the state representative implied in his campaign mailer that Pennsylvania has an overarching gun safety law. No such law exists. Gun safety is regulated by the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act, the last major version of which was written in 1995. Santarsiero was first elected to the state House in 2008. Santarsiero is running in the April 26 primary to replace Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican who isn’t seeking re-election. Guns have been at the center of his debates with his primary opponent Shaughnessy Naughton, a magazine publisher. Her campaign manager Erik Polyak called the mailer misleading, saying Santarsiero is "always exaggerating the record." A recent television ad released by Santarsiero’s campaign doesn’t include the claim that he wrote a "gun safety law," but rather states that he leads in pushing for expanded background checks in Pennsylvania. Since the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. that left 20 children and six adults dead, six states have expanded background check regulations. Our ruling Santarsiero, a candidate for Congress, claims in a recent campaign mailer that he "wrote PA’s Gun Safety Law." The campaign goes on to reference two bills that were authored by Santarsiero but that never made it out of committee. In addition, Pennsylvania doesn’t have an overarching law that governs "gun safety" and the law that does govern gun safety wasn’t written by Santarsiero. We rate the claim False.

pomt-11498	We "have laws on the books designed to prevent people with mental illnesses from getting firearms."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/26/paul-ryan/wake-parkland-paul-ryans-claim-about-laws-aimed-st/	A week after confessed Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz -- who had some level of mental health problems -- killed 17 people, President Donald Trump promised tougher mental health screening for gun buyers. Trump’s pledge seemed to contrast with a claim made the day after the shooting by U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan. In his weekly briefing with reporters on Feb. 15, 2018, the Wisconsin Republican said while discussing the Florida case: Remember, we do have laws on the books designed to prevent people with mental illnesses from getting firearms. Ryan alluded primarily to a 1968 federal law. Let’s see what it does. Federal law The federal Gun Control Act was passed following the 1968 assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Among other things, it prohibits anyone "who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution" from possessing a firearm. That’s a small portion of people with mental illness. And it doesn’t account for people who are more likely to be dangerous but don’t meet the threshold of being adjudicated or committed. Here are more specifics from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives: Adjudicated as a mental defective means a court or other lawful authority has determined that a person, as a result of mental illness or other conditions, "is a danger to himself or others, lacks the capacity" to manage his own affairs, or "is found insane by a court in a criminal case." Committed to a mental institution means a court or another authority has formally sent -- that is, involuntarily committed -- a person to a mental institution. Besides the federal law, Ryan’s office also cited similar state laws on gun possession and mental illness, but the federal law is primary here. Think of a funnel To grasp what the federal law does, picture a funnel. At the top are people with some form of mental illness; at the bottom are the relatively few who are prohibited from possessing a gun. Millions have mental illness: About 45 million U.S. adults live with mental illness, including 10 million who have a serious mental illness, according to the federal National Institute of Mental Health. "Serious mental illness" refers to "a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities." Relatively few are violent: People with mental illness are much more likely to be a victim of a violent crime, not a perpetrator, according to studies. Only 4 percent of violence toward others in American society is attributable to mental illness, according to John Monahan, a professor of law, psychology and psychiatry at the University of Virginia. Few shooters adjudicated/committed: "The existing body of research on mass shooters suggests that a history of civil commitment or legal adjudication" -- the standards set by the federal law -- "is practically unheard of among perpetrators of mass homicide and mass homicide-suicide, according to Gun Violence and Mental Illness, a 2016 book published by the American Psychiatric Association. (Experts told the New York Times -- which noted Cruz was clearly troubled but had no mental diagnosis -- that if Cruz had undergone a full psychiatric evaluation, it might have resulted in a temporary commitment at best, but not full-time institutionalization. One who has studied mass killers said: "Most of these shooters are angry, antisocial individuals you cannot spot in advance, and even if you could, you don’t have the right to institutionalize them.") Meanwhile, there are issues with the federal law itself. Problems with the law The federal law is both overinclusive and underinclusive, experts told us. Many mentally ill people who are covered by the federal law prohibiting them from having a gun do not pose a danger to others, said Pace University law professor and mental disability law expert Linda Fentiman. At the same time, she said, the law does not cover people who could pose more danger -- such as some schizophrenics who are also substance abusers and have committed violent acts -- if they haven’t been adjudicated or committed. Indeed, many people with more serious conditions go undiagnosed or do not get treatment, much less end up in a legal proceeding over their illness. Fentiman’s points were also made in a law journal article by a New York University law professor and gun law expert James Jacobs, which says: Undoubtedly, court proceedings are never initiated for the majority of dangerously mentally ill individuals … Likewise, a significant percentage of those adjudicated mentally defective or civilly committed are not actually dangerous. A footnote Before we close, a footnote on one gun restriction change, given that it has received references since the Florida school shooting: In February 2017, Trump and Congress rescinded an executive order signed two months earlier by President Barack Obama. It was intended to prohibit an estimated 75,000 people who have mental illness and get Social Security disability benefits from buying guns. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the order, saying it "advances and reinforces the harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent." Our rating Responding to the Florida school shooting, in which the confessed shooter has some history of mental health problems, Ryan said we "have laws on the books designed to prevent people with mental illnesses from getting firearms." A federal law, and some state laws, do prohibit people adjudicated as "mentally defective" or involuntarily committed to a mental health facility from possessing a gun. But experts say that standard includes people who do not pose a danger to others. And it does not account for a much larger set of people who might be dangerous but have not been diagnosed with, or treated for, a serious mental illness. For a statement that is partially accurate but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Half True.

pomt-10121	"AIG executives ... (took) a junket for over $400,000. Twice."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/14/barack-obama/beating-a-retreat-on-a-lavish-retreat/	Trying to finger executives connected to the financial market meltdown to justify his calls for more corporate accountability, Sen. Barack Obama is keying on officials of the giant insurer American International Group Inc., whose high-risk investment portfolio imploded as a result of the mortgage crisis, prompting an $85 billion, taxpayer-funded bailout. In stump speeches and during his second presidential debate with Sen. John McCain, Obama has trumpeted the fact that the company organized a $400,000 weeklong conference for brokers at a swanky California resort days after bailout, and planned a second such gathering. "Did you hear about these AIG executives? Here we are, we give them some help to keep their business afloat and they take a junket for over $400,000? Twice. Come on, now. They should return to Washington. If I was president, I would order them back. And I want a check for the taxpayers and they would be fired on the spot," Obama said at an Oct. 9 campaign rally in Cincinnati. Obama may be feeding big portions of red meat to Americans aggrieved by the dealings on Wall Street. But to put his claim in context, one has consider that AIG is a huge holding company with $1 trillion of assets that oversees distinct business units. The financial problems that triggered the bailout originated with a financial-products unit that guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and placed risky bets on the housing market. The Sept. 22-30 retreat at the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif. was organized months before the bailout by a separate AIG subsidiary that handles life insurance and that wasn't connected to the mortgage crisis. The object of the gathering at the St. Regis – where ocean-view rooms start at $565 per night – was to motivate and reward independent insurance brokers, who aren't AIG employees but sell the company's products. Such "attaboy" gatherings have been standard practice in the insurance business for many years, AIG Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy asserted in an Oct. 8 letter to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. (Details of the conference were first reported by the Orange County Register on Oct. 2.) The company, in an Oct. 8 statement addressing the affair, said only 10 of the more than 100 attendees were employees of the AIG insurance subsidiary, adding no executives from company headquarters were present. It's worth noting that while the junket might seem inappropriately lavish given the current circumstances, AIG’s life and property and casualty insurance businesses are financially sound, and have sufficient assets to pay claims. The financial-products business, on the other hand, was enmeshed in Wall Street's speculative bubble and sold contracts to guarantee mortgage-backed securities held by institutional investors. The collapse of the housing market drove down the value of these contracts and put the company in a severe cash squeeze, because it was forced to put up billions of dollars in collateral. Under terms of the bailout, the Fed gave AIG an $85 billion loan in exchange for 80 percent of its assets, reasoning that had the struggling company collapsed, it would have unleashed a vicious domino effect and toppled banks and corporations around the world. Obama is correct that the insurance brokers' gathering has hallmarks of a lavish junket. Records obtained from the St. Regis Resort by the House Oversight and Governmental Reform Committee, which is investigating AIG’s collapse, showed the insurer paid more than $147,000 for banquets, $23,000 for spa services and $6,900 for golf at the resort, located between Los Angeles and San Diego. Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman and others on the panel bitterly critizized the company for the trappings at a Oct. 7 hearing. What’s more, the company planned a similar October gathering at the posh Ritz-Carlton in Half Moon Bay, Calif. but said on Oct. 9 it cancelled the gathering in the face of intensifying criticism from Obama, the Bush administration and members of Congress. In the Oct. 8 letter to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. Liddy -- who replaced longtime AIG CEO Maurice "Hank" Greenberg after the government loaned the money -- said his company faces new challenges and "that we owe our employees and the American public new standards and approaches." Liddy said AIG was "reevaluating the costs of all aspects of our operations," in light of the turbulent market climate. So Obama has found a legitimate example of corporate excess at a company that's become a symbol of the financial crisis. And it's true that all of the AIG business units ultimately report to a single CEO and have a direct bearing on the company's bottom line. However, the decision to pamper the life insurance brokers appears to have been made independent of the turmoil roiling the financial markets and was an accepted way of doing business in the life insurance field, not as a symptom of Wall Street greed. And though those catering and spa bills were huge by hospitality standards, they're a pittance compared to the losses incurred dabbling in mortgage-backed securities. Obama's comments suggest a misunderstanding of the details behind AIG’s collapse, or a deliberate effort to skip over the realities of AIG's corporate structure in order to make a good point. Also, Obama slams AIG for two junkets at a time when the company had only held one. AIG might have had a tin ear when it came to organizing corporate events. But Obama’s wrong to lay blame for the financial meltdown on a highly regulated, profitable part of the business that sells life insurance. We rule the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03782	When students leave our high schools and they go to the community college, 70-75 percent of them have to pay to take remedial math.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/31/deborah-gist/ri-education-commissioner-deborah-gist-says-70-75-/	Controversy continues to rage over the requirement that Rhode Island high school students score highly enough on the New England Common Assessment Program test to receive a diploma. The latest testing data show that 40 percent of students failed to meet the minimum math standard and risk being unable to graduate if their skills don't improve. During the March 22 edition of Rhode Island Public Television's "A Lively Experiment," state Education Commissioner Deborah Gist defended the requirement. Gist said that if you let students graduate without proficiency you're shortchanging them. "Anyone who's telling these students that . . . it doesn't matter that they're able to do math at a basic level when they leave high school is just wrong. And it's not fair to them because what's going to happen to them when they leave our high schools and they go to the community college where 70-75 percent of them have to pay to take remedial courses to get the exact same math that we're talking about?" Seventy to seventy-five percent of Rhode Island high school graduates who go to community college have to take remedial courses in math? That struck us as a huge percentage, even for those graduates who wanted a higher education but might not have had the grades, test scores or money to get into a four-year school. So we decided to check the numbers. First stop: Gist's office, where spokesman Elliot Krieger told us that the data came from the Rhode Island Office of Higher Education. When we contacted that office, spokesman Michael Trainor sent us to the Community College of Rhode Island, where William LeBlanc, the school's director of institutional research and planning, gave us the data for students enrolled last fall who had graduated from high school -- 97 percent of them from Rhode Island -- within the previous year. CCRI uses a placement test called Accuplacer, developed by the same group responsible for the Scholastic Assessment Test for college-bound high school students, to identify students who need remedial work. Among those 2,250 recent high school graduates, just over 75 percent needed some type of remedial course, whether it was math, English or writing, LeBlanc said. "That's the highest we've had in awhile." The rate usually ranges from 70-75 percent. He said that's not unusual for a community college. The biggest need was usually for remedial math -- 65.7 didn't pass the math requirement. They had to take Fundamentals of Math -- which deals with basic arithmetic, percentages and working with fractions -- or high school algebra. In addition, 47 percent had to take remedial reading and 36 percent of the recent high school graduates were required to take remedial writing, LeBlanc said. Our ruling Education Commissioner Deborah Gist said, "When [students] leave our high schools and they go to the community college . . . 70-75 percent of them have to pay to take remedial [math] courses." The actual rate this past fall at CCRI was 65.7 percent. It's not in the range cited by Gist, but it's close enough to earn her a Mostly True.

pomt-00473	Says Ohio Gov. John Kasich is "very unpopular."	false	/ohio/statements/2018/aug/14/donald-trump/after-close-ohio-special-election-trump-falsely-tw/	President Donald Trump blamed Ohio Gov. John Kasich for the narrow win by Republican Troy Balderson in a special election. "The very unpopular Governor of Ohio (and failed presidential candidate) @JohnKasich hurt Troy Balderson’s recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate. Even Kasich’s Lt. Governor lost Gov. race because of his unpopularity. Credit to Troy on the BIG WIN!" Trump tweeted Aug. 13. Kasich didn’t seem to agree. He responded on Twitter with a GIF of Vladimir Putin laughing. We will focus on Trump’s statement that Kasich is "very unpopular," but we will also provide some context about Balderson’s close race in the special election for the Ohio 12th congressional district and Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor’s loss in the GOP primary to Attorney General Mike DeWine for governor. First, some background about the Aug. 7 special election to replace Republican U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi, who resigned his seat representing suburban Columbus and nearby rural areas. Balderson, a state senator, has likely won the race, leading Democrat Danny O’Connor, a county recorder, by about 1 percentage point. Elections officials will begin the official canvass to count provisional and absentee ballots on Aug. 18 and certify the results by Aug. 24. No matter who wins, they are both running again in November. The close race drew national interest because in 2016 Trump won the district by 11 percentage points, and the district has largely been represented by Republicans for decades. Trump’s tweet followed Kasich’s appearance on Meet the Press, during which Kasich criticized the Trump team, saying, "It wasn't a good night because this is a district that you should be winning by, you know, overwhelming numbers." Kasich’s popularity Kasich was first elected Ohio governor in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. He is term-limited and considering a challenge against Trump in 2020. In March 2011, Kasich’s favorability among the Ohioans was an abysmal 30 percent. But his popularity later increased. A compilation of recent polls show that Kasich has largely positive approval ratings. A Quinnipiac poll in June 2018 showed that 52 percent of Ohio voters approved of Kasich, while 36 percent disapproved, which translates to a plus-16 spread. But the poll showed that Kasich was doing better with Democrats than with his fellow Republicans -- Democrats approved of Kasich 57 - 33 percent. Republicans were divided, as 46 percent approve and 44 percent disapprove. Kasich has drawn support from some Democrats because he has criticized Trump and supported Medicaid expansion. University of Akron Professor David B. Cohen said Kasich remains quite popular in Ohio. "It’s more than a bit ironic that President Trump is claiming that Gov. Kasich is unpopular since Trump is historically unpopular, has been throughout his entire presidency, and his disapproval numbers have been consistently higher than his approval ratings," Cohen said. In July, PolitiFact found that Trump was performing relatively worse compared with his contemporaries. However, Trump has fared well with Ohio Republicans. Herb Asher, political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University, said Kasich is viewed positively overall. "But among a subset of Republicans -- the Trump loyalists -- he is not highly regarded," he said. Cedarville University political science professor Mark Caleb Smith said that the best indicator of Kasich's weakness in current Ohio politics is how no other Republicans are grabbing his moderate mantle statewide. "In this narrow way, Trump's electoral influence is significant in the state," he said. "Trump won Ohio handily in 2016's general election, though Kasich did defeat Trump in the Ohio Republican primary." The White House did not respond to our emails. Kasich impact on Balderson and Taylor races We aren’t rating Trump’s comments blaming Kasich for Balderson’s narrow win and Taylor’s loss. But Ohio political experts were skeptical about Trump’s statements. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report found that Balderson probably owed his win to a late ad featuring Kasich, not a late rally by Trump. "Balderson held onto a solid nine-point margin in wealthy suburban Delaware County, Kasich's base, where turnout was high," Wasserman wrote. "But turnout was abysmally low in the district's most pro-Trump rural counties." Experts generally told us that Kasich wasn’t to blame for Taylor’s loss in the primary for governor. Taylor, who ran on a Trumpian agenda, was viewed as the underdog in the GOP primary against the better-funded and more experienced DeWine. But Taylor distanced herself from Kasich, and he didn’t campaign for her. Our ruling Trump said in a tweet that Kasich is "very unpopular." Polls have consistently shown that Kasich has had a positive approval rating for years. His current approval rating in Ohio is 52 percent approval, with 36 percent disapproval.

pomt-00145	If you get a flu shot, you're "poisoning yourself."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/25/blog-posting/bloggers-poison-truth-claim-about-flu-shot-dangers/	The push to get people vaccinated against influenza is in full swing, and so are efforts to scare people away from getting their shots. In a Facebook post, Nicole LeCrone Estep, who claims to have "worked in healthcare for years," offers a photograph of a sign about flu shots that asks people to "Research side effects & ingredients before poisoning yourself!" The word "poisoning" is in bright red letters. The post states that the flu shot includes ingredients such as mercury, antifreeze, phenol, animal blood, animal viruses and formaldehyde. The meme offers no evidence and cites no source. She did not respond to a Facebook message. The Oct. 11, 2018 post has been shared more than 27,800 times. It was flagged by Facebook members as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Medical experts say the evidence is overwhelming that flu shots are safe and effective, although they routinely acknowledge that the shots are far from completely protective. The degree of protection depends, in part, on how well the experts predict which strains of influenza will be making the rounds during the coming flu season. Last year, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the shots were only 40% effective (57% for ages 6 months to 8 years and adults 50 to 64). Of the 183 children killed during the flu last season, about 80% were not vaccinated. So what about the "poisons" cited in the Facebook post? "Almost everything in there is false," said Dr. Neal A. Halsey, after reading the post. Halsey is director emeritus of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. Let's go through the list. MERCURY - This is a reference to thimerosal, a preservative that inactivates any contaminants that might have escaped the production process. Thimerosal contains ethyl mercury, which decomposes rapidly, quickly passes through the body and is widely considered safe, unlike its poisonous cousin, methyl mercury, which is found in certain kinds of fish. Most flu vaccines no longer contain thimerosal and the ones that do -- packaged for multiple doses -- contain an amount too minuscule to cause harm. Vaccine opponents say thimerosal contains poisonous mercury and may cause autism. There is no evidence that the thimerosal in vaccines is harmful and numerous studies have disproven the claim that it causes autism. ANTIFREEZE - The meme isn't specific here. After all, common table salt is an antifreeze, lowering the freezing point of water. In addition, various creatures use natural antifreeze chemicals such as glycerol or dimethyl sulfoxide to survive freezing temperatures. Automotive antifreeze products contain ethylene glycol or propylene glycol. Neither are found in flu vaccines. "No influenza vaccine contains an antifreeze," said Dr. Halsey. PHENOL - It's not used in the flu vaccine. (Though it is used in some over-the-counter products like mouthwashes, throat lozenges and throat sprays!) ANIMAL BLOOD - Chicken eggs have been used to make the flu vaccine but "there is no animal blood in the influenza vaccine and any residual animal proteins or products from the eggs are not harmful to people," Dr. Halsey said. (In the past, people with a sensitivity to chicken eggs were excluded but new filtration rules have removed so much egg protein that it no longer poses a serious risk. Some flu vaccines aren't made with eggs at all.) ANIMAL VIRUSES - They have not been found in any flu vaccine. FORMALDEHYDE - This is present in tiny amounts of some flu vaccines. It has been used for years in vaccine development, often to kill live virus particles so they can be used in the vaccine to safely immunize a recipient. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, formaldehyde is also used "to kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production." If it is used, most is removed before the vaccine is packaged, the CDC reports. The human body, in fact, makes its own formaldehyde and is continuously processing the chemical. A healthy newborn weighing 6 to 8 pounds has 50 to 70 times more formaldehyde in their body than what they would get from all their vaccines, according to the Food and Drug Administration. In short, the claim that you are poisoning yourself when you get the flu vaccine is false. The fact that the vaccine could save you days of misery; prevent you from spreading the virus to family, friends and coworkers; and might even save your life or, indirectly, the lives of others, makes the claim irresponsible.

pomt-14992	"African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/13/bernie-sanders/debate-bernie-sanders-says-african-american-youth-/	During his opening statement at the first Democratic presidential debate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders turned to some statistics he’s used before on the stump, decrying high rates of joblessness among young African-Americans. "African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent," Sanders said at the Oct. 13, 2015, debate in Las Vegas. "Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent." That’s similar -- but not identical -- to a claim we checked in July. Back then, he said that for African-Americans between the ages of 17 and 20, "the real unemployment rate … is 51 percent." We rated that Mostly True. However, since the claim was phrased somewhat differently, we’ll take a fresh look at it here. At the debate, Sanders didn’t define the age range in question, but the most readily available "youth" data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers ages 16 to 19. For individuals age 16 to 19 in September 2015, the official unemployment rate for whites was 13.9 percent, for Hispanics it was 18.6 percent, and for African-Americans it was 31.5 percent. For individuals in that age range of all races and ethnicities, the unemployment rate was 16.3 percent. While the rates for both minority groups are lower than the rate for whites, they are still well below the figures Sanders offered at the debate. So what’s going on? When we checked this claim in July, we noted that Sanders, by using the term "the real unemployment rate," had telegraphed that he was not using the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic. Indeed, when we asked Sanders’ camp for supporting evidence, they pointed us to research by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. This data was different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons. One, the institute didn’t just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling. And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were "marginally attached to the labor force." The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren’t entirely out of the market, either. The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of "labor underutilization" rather than "unemployment." EPI itself used the term "underemployment" in its research. It’s a real statistic, but in July Sanders didn’t really describe it the correct way. He twice used the term "unemployment rate" and once used the variation "real unemployment rate," a vague term that doesn’t have any official definition at BLS and wasn’t mentioned in the EPI research he was quoting. His phrasing during the debate was even more problematic. He simply said, "unemployment rate," without indicating that he was using a non-standard measurement. Also, the EPI data only went through March 2015. But since March, the overall unemployment rate for all African-Americans has fallen by almost 1 percentage point, though the rate for the subset of 16-to-19-year-olds has zigzagged since then. (This youth subset is based on a small sample and has a higher margin of error.) All this said, Sanders does have a point that young African-Americans and Hispanics have higher rates of unemployment than young whites do. "What's odd about Sanders' choice is that he could have used the official unemployment statistics and still made his point that African American and Hispanic youth have higher rates of unemployment than other groups," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and chief economist at the jobs site Indeed. Our ruling During the debate, Sanders said that "African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent." He has a point that African-American and Hispanic youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than whites do. But his numbers are too far off. Using the standard method for determining the jobless rate, the figure for African-American youths is 31.5 percent and for Hispanic youths it’s 18.6 percent. While those rates are still disproportionately high, they are not nearly as high as Sanders said. The statement is partially accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-14611	When terrorists killed more than 250 Americans in Lebanon under Ronald Reagan, "the Democrats didn’t make that a partisan issue."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/01/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-compares-benghazi-1983-attack-mari/	Republican attacks on Benghazi are totally overblown, Hillary Clinton says. The Democrats didn’t act this way when something similar happened under President Ronald Reagan. At a CNN town hall for Democratic presidential candidates, an audience member asked how the former secretary of state will work with Congress in responding to the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in the Libyan city. Clinton said the Republican-led inquiries continue to exist only for a partisan purpose. "When Ronald Reagan was president in 1983, our Marine barracks, our embassy were attacked in Beirut," she said at the Jan. 25 event in Iowa. "More than 250 Americans were killed. The Democrats didn’t make that a partisan issue. So, the Democratic Congress worked with the Republican president to say what can we do? How do we fix this?" The April and October 1983 attacks happened when Democrats held the House, and Reagan’s reelection was around the corner. We wondered if the Lebanon bombings really did rise above partisan politics. We consulted experts and read numerous media accounts from the time and found that Clinton has a point that Congress’ reaction to Beirut was more muted than its reaction to Benghazi. Still, criticizing Reagan over Beirut was a big talking point for some Democrats. Muffled congressional reaction Reagan sent 800 Marines to Lebanon on a peacekeeping mission in 1982, partly in the interest in stymying Soviet Union influence. They found themselves in the middle of a civil war. In April 1983, Hezbollah terrorists killed 17 Americans in a suicide bombing at the embassy in Beirut. Six months later, a truck carrying another Hezbollah suicide bomber drove onto Marine barracks in the same city, detonating thousands of pounds of explosives and killing 241 American service personnel. Reagan pulled the Marines out in February 1984. Like the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four Americans, questions quickly arose about inadequate security at the Beirut Marine compound. The truck carrying the suicide bomber broke through several barriers before crashing into the building where the Marines slept. Also like Benghazi, the two Beirut attacks happened when opposing parties held the White House and the House of Representatives. In 1983, Republicans held the White House, and Democrats held the House, vice versa in 2012. Here’s where the similarities in congressional reaction unravel. Unlike Benghazi, the 1983 Democratic House only launched one investigation into the Beirut attack, lasting a few months. Compare that to at least six Republican House Benghazi inquiries, one of which is still going on more than three years since the attack. Further, representatives from both parties largely agreed on the Beirut report’s findings, while Democrats for the most part oppose the Benghazi investigations. Democrats’ response to Beirut was more about preventing a future attack and less about playing politics, said Lawrence Korb, senior fellow at the progressive Center for American Progress and assistant secretary of defense under Reagan from 1981-85. He added that the Beirut attacks (and other significant foreign policy events under Reagan) pushed Democrats and Republicans to work together to pass a significant bill that rearranged how different branches of the military worked together. "It wasn’t partisan, people just wanted to know what happened," Korb said. "No one was saying ‘fire general so-and-so’ or anything like that." Within 48 hours of the Beirut bombings, the United States invaded the Caribbean island nation of Grenada, which might have played a role in muffling Congress’ reaction to the Beirut bombings, said Stephen Knott, national security professor at the U.S. Naval War College and former director of the Ronald Reagan Oral History Project at the University of Virginia. Knott said the reaction to Grenada was partisan, noting that several House Democrats moved to impeach Reagan. And many Democrats still think the invasion was an attempt to redirect attention away from Beirut, an allegation Knott said is incorrect. "The reaction to (Grenada) allowed critics to pounce on Reagan's policies without seeming to appear to capitalize on the deaths of American Marines," Knott said. "The Reagan years were hardly an idyllic era of foreign policy bipartisanship." Rhetorical backlash Even if formal congressional reaction to the Beirut bombings was limited, the attacks played a big role in political rhetoric over the next year. The day after the 1983 bombings, the New York Times ran a story about how Democrats were preparing to campaign on the Lebanon attacks during the upcoming presidential primary. Eventual 1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale, who served as Jimmy Carter’s vice president, called out Reagan personally for slacking on Lebanon. ''During all this time, the president is on vacation in California,"' Mondale said in February 1984. ''If the nation is in trouble, the president of the United States should be at the helm. I recommend today Mr. Reagan get on that plane to come back to Washington and answer our questions.'' Mondale also said, following another attack on the U.S. embassy in Beirut in 1984, that through lax security, Reagan had allowed Lebanese terrorists to ''humiliate us and push us around and kill our people.'' On the congressional side, House Speaker Tip O’Neill, D-Mass., called the the Reagan administration’s foreign policy "frightening" — despite generally supporting Reagan’s efforts abroad previously. The following April, Reagan said Congressional criticism of his administration’s efforts in Lebanon and calls for troop removal had opened the gates to terrorists, according to the New York Times. ''The deaths of the U.S. Marines are the responsibility of the President of the United States,'' O’Neill responded. ''He acted against the wishes of our top military in this country, and now he is looking for a scapegoat.'' To sum it up: Beirut wasn’t immune to politics. It’s impossible to know for sure whether rhetoric signifies partisan attacks or simply true policy opinion differences, Matthew Beckmann, a political science professor at the University of California Irvine who has studied Reagan’s relationship with Congress. He noted, though, that research shows partisan disagreement has become more reflexive and entrenched since the 1980s. "So officials' reactions and reporters' coverage of Beirut vis-a-vis Benghazi are surely different, quantitatively and qualitatively, but that says more about systemic changes in Washington politics than changes in leaders' personal virtue," he said. Our ruling Clinton said that when terrorists killed more than 250 Americans in Lebanon under Ronald Reagan, "the Democrats didn’t make that a partisan issue." Clinton has a strong point that the Democrat-held House did not react as forcefully to the 1983 Beirut bombings as the Republican-held House reacted to the 2012 Benghazi attack, which killed four. The House conducted a single investigation into the Beirut bombings, which killed more than 250 Americans, while it has conducted six inquiries into Benghazi, which killed four. But it’s not totally accurate to say the Democrats didn’t make it a partisan issue. Mondale, running against Reagan in 1984, and some congressional Democrats repeatedly said Reagan had failed personally regarding Lebanon. We rate Clinton’s partially accurate claim Half True.

pomt-01167	"There is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/11/john-stossel/fox-business-pundit-no-good-data-deaths-secondhand/	All those warnings you heard about secondhand smoke from your mother, federal government PSAs and school D.A.R.E. instructors? Bogus, a Fox Business host claimed recently. In a discussion about waning personal freedom in the free world, pundit John Stossel went off about the onslaught of government rules and regulations telling Americans what they can do and when, where and how they can do it. He used cigarette-smoking as an example, arguing that business owners should have the right to allow smoking in their bars or restaurants even where ordinances or laws ban the practice. "Yeah, they kill smokers," Stossel said on Fox & Friends of cigarettes. "But there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people." A Fox spokeswoman did not return our inquiry, and Stossel, who has long questioned the lethal nature of secondhand smoke, did not reply to emails and tweets. (The exchange in question was a follow-up to a Dec. 4 segment on his Thursday show, when he said, "the secondhand smoke scare turns out to be bunk. But the smokers still take it.") Stossel’s definition of "good" might be different than ours, but there is plenty of scientific research and consensus that secondhand smoke does indeed kill people. Secondhand smoke is a mixture of smoke emitted from the burning end of a cigarette or other tobacco products and what’s exhaled by smokers. It’s regarded as a cancer-causing agent, a "known human carcinogen" (a healthful classification, that is not). The government has campaigned for tough anti-smoking policies in public places and workplaces as a way to protect Americans from secondhand smoke, saying there is no safe level of exposure. Reports from the country’s top doctors say these laws are reducing risk. The U.S. surgeon general has released 31 reports about the effects of smoking since 1964. These reports are extremely detailed, summarizing the latest research on smoking and peer-reviewed by dozens of the nation’s top scientists. Consensus on secondhand smoke really began to form in the 1980s, even as the tobacco industry’s"doubt-creation machine" spun opposing talking points, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, senior scientific editor of the 2014 surgeon general report and director of the University of Southern California’s Institute for Global Health. The surgeon general’s 2006 report stated rather bluntly that inhaling secondhand smoke "causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease in nonsmoking adults." Involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke killed more than 49,000 nonsmokers in 2005, plus 430 newborns who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the report said. In 2014, the acting surgeon general released a new report, one that factored in input from more than 80 contributing authors and 150 reviewers who are experts in medicine and public health. Secondhand smoke can also increase risk of stroke, the new report found. Beyond that, involuntary exposure poses significant problems for children, worsening asthma and leading to other respiratory conditions. Since 1964, the report said, 2.46 million non-smokers have died from exposure to secondhand smoke. How does the government calculate its numbers? Scientists don’t keep a count of deaths by secondhand smoke as recorded in death certificates. (Death certificates don’t list "secondhand smoke" as a cause of death.) Instead, they rely on statistical methods used by epidemiologists, who are experts in disease patterns within populations. To figure out lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke, for instance, the individual risk of lung cancer is analyzed next to the proportion of people exposed to secondhand smoke. It’s a complicated statistical analysis (page 659 explains more), one with which Stossel obviously finds fault. But it’s not unusual. The same method is used to attribute the number of deaths from obesity through diabetes, for example, Samet said. "This is the basic way to use to understand how the disease is exposed to this risk," Samet said. "We understand that there are uncertainties that go with this, but this is a very basic tool. ... The approach here is embedded in science and policy and understanding how much a disease is caused by something." The surgeon general is not alone in major scientific organizations linking secondhand smoke with deadly diseases. There’s also the World Health Organization’s International Center for Research on Cancer, the Environmental Protection Agency, the American Cancer Society, and the National Academy of Sciences. "At this point, the evidence is firm and very powerful, and important conclusions have been reached," Samet said. You can quibble over specific numbers since they’re approximations, said Gary Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. But not that secondhand smoke kills, he said. "Chronic exposure produces disease and death," Giovino said. How do folks such as Stossel respond? The libertarian Cato Institute published a response to the 2006 surgeon general’s report on secondhand smoke that highlighted testimony before a committee of the British Parliament by Oxford epidemiologist Richard Peto. Peto, who has studied the causes of cancer and the effects of smoking, testified that he could not quantify deaths from secondhand smoke because "these hazards cannot be directly measured." (The story was written by Gio Gori, an epidemiologist who wrote publications on behalf of the industry-backed Tobacco Institute refuting studies about nicotine’s harmful effects.) Conversely, some scientists say the government is actually undercounting secondhand smoke-related deaths. "The criticism … is not that they overestimate the risk, it’s that they’re underestimating it," said Stanton Glantz, a University of California San Francisco medicine professor and director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. And dog lovers, beware: New evidence shows secondhand smoke can also kill pets, including lung and nasal cancer in dogs and malignant lymphoma in cats. Our ruling Stossel said "there is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people." His definition of good obviously differs with the vast majority of scientists and researchers studying the effects of secondhand smoke. They say the data does show that secondhand smoke kills people. And that the data is indeed solid. Stossel’s claim rates False.	None	John Stossel	None	None	None	2014-12-11T15:12:19	2014-12-04	['None']
pomt-11263	"We have never been paid by the Trump campaign."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/27/diamond-and-silk/were-diamond-and-silk-paid-trump-campaign/	Pro-Donald Trump activists Diamond and Silk insisted in sworn congressional testimony that they never received payment from Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. "We have never been paid by the Trump campaign," Lynnette Hardaway repeatedly told the House Judiciary Committee during an April 26 hearing. Hardaway makes up half the social media ensemble, along with her sister Rochelle Richardson. Diamond and Silk stuck to their claim even after confronted with an FEC filing showing the campaign gave them $1,274. We decided to look closer. Travel expense reimbursement Diamond and Silk were on Capitol Hill for a hearing into allegations that social networks like Facebook censor conservative content, when the conversation veered toward their relationship with Trump. In a contentious exchange with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, Hardaway said five times that the activists have never been paid by the Trump campaign. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Later, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., reminded the sisters they were under oath and subject to perjury, before asking them about receiving money from Trump’s campaign. He cited an FEC filing showing the Trump campaign gave them $1,274 for "field consulting." Richardson explained the money was reimbursement for travel expenses the sisters incurred for airfare to a 2016 event called Women for Trump. The reference to "field consulting," she said, may have been a mistake on the Trump campaign’s part. Bradley Crate, the treasurer for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., sent PolitiFact an email that corroborated the sisters’ claim about reimbursement: "The issue regarding Diamond and Silk is merely one of semantics, resulting from a reasonable misunderstanding of the Campaign’s reporting obligations. The Campaign’s payment to Diamond and Silk for field consulting was based on an invoice they submitted reflecting their costs for air travel to a Campaign event. The invoice was not supported by accompanying receipts, so as a technical matter, could not be reported as a reimbursement even though its purpose was to make them whole for their out-of-pocket costs." Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group, said, "The payment sounds like a reasonable reimbursement of travel costs." But he noted because the payment was not accompanied with receipts and was thus declared as payment for services by the Trump campaign, the activists "are obligated to declare it as income and pay taxes on it." That said, reasonable people can disagree about whether reimbursement for travel expenses constitutes "pay" or not. Our ruling Pro-Donald Trump activists Diamond and Silk said, "We have never been paid by the Trump campaign." The social media ensemble received $1,274 from the Trump campaign. It was a one-time payment and both parties maintain it was reimbursement for travel expenses. Because reasonable people can disagree about whether reimbursement for travel expenses constitutes "pay" or not, we rate this Mostly True.

pomt-09818	A scheduled speech by President Barack Obama will be "the first time an American president has spoken directly to the nation's school children about persisting and succeeding in school."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/03/arne-duncan/barack-obama-not-first-president-address-school-ch/	Education Secretary Arne Duncan urged the nation's principals to allow their students to watch a Sept. 8 address on the importance of education from President Barack Obama. "The president will challenge students to work hard, set educational goals, and take responsibility for their learning," Duncan wrote, adding, "This is the first time an American president has spoken directly to the nation's schoolchildren about persisting and succeeding in school. We encourage you to use this historic moment to help your students get focused and begin the school year strong." The speech drew fire from some Republicans who said schoolchildren should not be required to listen to the Democratic president's address. The Republican Party of Florida went further, saying Obama would "indoctrinate" schoolchildren with "socialist ideology," forcing them "to watch the president justify his plans for government-run health care, banks, and automobile companies, increasing taxes on those who create jobs, and racking up more debt than any other president." We rated that claim Pants on Fire! But Duncan was wrong when he wrote that Obama's speech would be "the first time an American president has spoken directly to the nation's schoolchildren about persisting and succeeding in school." President George H.W. Bush gave an address to schools nationwide in 1991, from a junior high school in Washington, D.C. News reports from the time said the White House hoped that the address would be shown at schools nationwide, and Bush began his remarks by saying he was talking to "millions" of students "in classrooms all across the country." You can read Bush's complete remarks via the Web site of his presidential library. Here's an excerpt: "When it comes to your own education, what I'm saying is take control. Don't say school is boring and blame it on your teachers. Make your teachers work hard. Tell them you want a first-class education. Tell them that you're here to learn. Block out the kids who think it's not cool to be smart. I can't understand for the life of me what's so great about being stupid. ... "If you don't work hard, who gets hurt? If you cheat, who pays the price? If you cut corners, if you hunt for the easy A, who comes up short? Easy answer to that one: You do. You're in control, but you are not alone. People want you to succeed. They want to help you succeed." The presidential library noted that the president spoke at 12:15 p.m. and that his remarks were "broadcast live by the Cable News Network, the Public Broadcasting System, the Mutual Broadcasting System, and the NBC radio network." You may have guessed this already, but news reports from the time indicate that Democrats criticized Bush for giving the speech. "The Department of Education should not be producing paid political advertising for the president, it should be helping us to produce smarter students," said Rep. Richard Gephardt, then the Democratic majority leader in the House of Representatives."And the president should be doing more about education than saying, 'Lights, camera, action.'" Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, said the speech showed "the arrogance of power," and that the White House should not be "using precious dollars for campaigns" when "we are struggling for every silly dime we can get" for education. Republicans, though, defended the right of the president to address students. "Why is it political for the president of the United States to discuss education?" asked Newt Gingrich, who was then the House Republican whip. "It was done at a nonpolitical site and was beamed to a nonpolitical audience. . . . They wanted to reach the maximum audience with the maximum effect to improve education." We also found that Ronald Reagan took questions from high school students at the White House in 1986, and the question-and-answer session was broadcast nationally. Reagan urged the students to stay in school and say no to drugs, but he also discussed overtly political matters, such as national defense funding, nuclear disarmament and — in suprising policy detail — taxes. (Read Reagan's complete remarks .) "When we came into office, the top personal tax rate that the federal government could put on your income was 70 percent," Reagan said in his opening remarks. "Now, you can understand, I think, that if you were getting up in those brackets — there were 14 different tax brackets, depending on the amount of money in each bracket you earned. And when you could look and say, 'If I earn another dollar, I only get to keep 30 cents out of it,' you can imagine the lack of incentive there. Well, we lowered it to 50 percent, and the economy really took off." Later in the session, a student asked Reagan what he considered his greatest achievement as president. Reagan said it was that the House and Senate had separately passed legislation cutting taxes, and he was looking forward to seeing the legislation finalized and become law. "So, I think the fact that we have finally gotten the Congress of the United States to deal with this problem of tax reform is the greatest achievement," Reagan said. "And I'm going to be riding herd all the way to see that we finally get it through." We looked for news reports of Democrats protesting Reagan's broadcast, but were unable to find any in electronic research databases. We should emphasize that this may be due to the fact that many news reports from 1986 are unavailable online. We feel that President George H.W. Bush's speech to students is enough evidence to show that Obama was not the first president to speak "directly to the nation's schoolchildren about persisting and succeeding in school." Bush's speech was quite explicitly "about persisting and succeeding in school." Duncan's statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.

pomt-14825	In 2013, the United States "accepted 67 percent of the world’s refugees."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/nov/22/michael-needham/did-united-states-accept-two-thirds-worlds-refugee/	After a week of intense debate following the terrorist attacks on Paris, two-thirds of Americans now say they oppose President Barack Obama’s plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees, according to a Fox News poll. This message from the people is not one of one callousness, but of common sense, said Michael Needham of the conservative advocacy group Heritage Action. "America’s an extraordinarily compassionate nation. We accept 50 percent. In 2013, we accepted 67 percent of the world’s refugees," Needham said on Nov. 22’s Fox News Sunday. "Compassion doesn’t require being stupid, however." Does the United States accept two-thirds of refugees worldwide? The statement description is imprecise, if not misleading. The figure refers to the United States’ share of a very specific and small subset of the total refugee population. Let’s break it down. The numbers "The world’s refugees" currently total 14.4 million under the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, up from 11.7 million refugees in 2013. Needham’s phrasing makes it sound like we have 8 million refugees in the country. But that’s not the case. In reality, about 264,000 refugees, or 2.3 percent, resided in the United States in 2013. So where does the 67 percent come from? A spokesperson for Heritage Action referred us to a State Department report. According to the report, 67 percent of refugees referred for resettlement by the UNHCR were resettled in the United States. In other words, after fleeing their country of origin and residing in another country, these refugees were then relocated to a third country. For 48,000 of those 71,000 refugees in 2013, the United States was that third country. (The UNHCR confirms those figures.) Beyond resettlement It’s important to note that less than 1 percent of all refugees are resettled by the process we just described. These people tend to be the most vulnerable, those unable to go home and unable to survive where they currently are. (For example, half of Syrian refugees admitted into the United States so far are children.) The United States doesn’t have to deal with 99 percent of refugees directly, because "we have the advantage of geography," said Lavinia Limón, president of the advocacy group the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. Most countries offering asylum for refugees are geographically close to war-torn states like Syria. As we noted in a previous fact-check, Turkey shelters the greatest number of refugees within its borders (1.6 million), with Pakistan and Lebanon not too far behind. While Limón noted that "nobody wants to host refugees," she also pointed out that Turkey has spent a lot of money in recent years (about $1 billion in 2012). And relative to their populations, "Lebanon and Jordan pull more than their weight," said Kevin Appleby, the director of United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Office of Migration and Refugee Policy. "Their infrastructures and resources are stretched. They’re on the frontlines." Refugees who don’t return home or aren’t resettled sometimes languish in limbo for years or even decades. The average length of stay in a refugee camp is 17 years. "We call it warehousing," said Limón. "You keep them alive, but they have no future, they have nothing they can look forward to, their rights to work, basic education, moving around, are constantly being violated." Because the vast majority of refugees don’t get to leave these camps and resettle elsewhere, some advocates argue that humanitarian aid gets you the most bang for your buck. Japan, for example, is a top donor but doesn’t take in refugees for resettlement. The United States in contrast is also the largest provider of international assistance in the world, a fact noted by both Limón and Appleby. "The United States is No. 1, no question," Limon said when asked which country does the most for refugees. "The U.S. can be proud of what we’ve done, but we could do more." "We have the capacity to do more," Appleby said, noting that we could feasibly take in 100,000 refugees every year. "Every slot in the refugee program is a life." Our ruling Needham said, "In 2013, we accepted 67 percent of the world’s refugees." Needham’s claim refers to a specific way of accepting refugees — through a process known as resettlement. In 2013, about 48,000, or 67 percent, of 71,000 resettled refugees were resettled in the United States. But that’s a tiny fraction of the "world’s refugees," which totalled 11.7 million in 2013. Of the overall refugee group, just 2.3 percent resided in the United States. Needham’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08583	On campaign donations from Texas Capitol lobbyists.	half flip	/texas/statements/2010/sep/26/brian-birdwell/brian-birdwell-criticized-election-foe-capitol-lob/	This June, Republican Brian Birdwell of Granbury won a special election runoff to fill a vacated Texas Senate seat he's now poised to capture for a full term; he's unopposed on the November general-election ballot. Like many a winner for state office, Birdwell subsequently welcomed donations at a post-election fundraiser in Austin to which lobbyists for special interests were invited. The Sept. 16 event was hosted by the political arm of Texans for Lawsuit Reform, which endorsed Birdwell not long after his win, TLR spokeswoman Sherry Sylvester told us. Nothing odd about tapping the lobby for contributions after an election, right? For Birdwell, we wondered. As Birdwell stumped toward victory, he was critical of his final foe, pointing out in a press release that he'd raised more money from residents of the Waco-area district. He noted that his opponent, senator-turned-lobbyist David Sibley, had leaned on contributions from Austin-based special interests including lobbyists. Birdwell's June 15 release says Sibley's candidacy "has little to do with our district interests, but is all about him protecting his special interests. Waco, Cleburne, Waxahachie and the many small communities of this district deserve a voice to represent them. Austin already has over 1,400 lobbyists and we don't need one as our state senator." The statement also says: "The simple fact is, lobbyists and PACs can't vote, but my supporters who live in the district can." At the time, Birdwell certainly wasn't attracting lobbyist support. Up to his win, Birdwell drew donations from a single Austin political action committee, according to his campaign finance reports. From March through June, less than $11,200, 7 percent of his total contributions, came from four Austin donors, counting two PACs. Has the rookie senator flip-flopped on taking donations from lobbyists? Birdwell was unavailable for an interview. However, Maggie Mayfield, his campaign spokeswoman, shared a statement from the senator that refers to an unsuccessful Democratic Party lawsuit challenging Birdwell's legal residency in Texas which, Birdwell's statement says, resulted in "significant legal bills." Birdwell didn't volunteer the names of new lobbyist donors, but his statement says he's "happy to to have the support of groups in Austin who didn't originally back my candidacy." Birdwell's statement also says his campaign is having a number of fund-raisers across his district, though he has "no expectation" of recouping through donations the personal loans he made to his campaign. Birdwell's latest contribution and expenditure report doesn't show any outstanding loans. However, his campaign finance filings covering March through June indicate he put more than $170,000 in personal funds into his campaign -- about half of $337,000 in total campaign spending, we calculate. On the paperwork, Birdwell marked that he intends to get reimbursed from political contributions for the personal expenditures. All in all, it would require a break from political reality to ding the senator for accepting contributions from interest groups wielding clout at the Capitol. That happens routinely. Besides, we see no sign Birdwell ever vowed not to take such aid. Still, after poking his opponent for piling up lobby money, Birdwell is evidently aboard with doing the same.

pomt-03924	"In other jurisdictions where (a domestic partnership registry) has been enacted, we have seen that fewer people enter into marriage."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/feb/22/florida-conference-catholic-bishops/do-places-domestic-partnerships-have-fewer-marriag/	Florida lawmakers heard a bill that would allow couples who live together anywhere in the state to register for a domestic partnership, a designation that would afford them some of the same rights as married couples. The outlook for SB 196 isn’t promising. Social conservatives control the Capitol, Florida voters enacted a ban on gay marriage in the state Constitution, and bill sponsor Sen. Eleanor Sobel, D-Hollywood, could not get enough votes to move her measure out of her committee. Sobel called it the "shacking up" bill because it would benefit all couples, both gay and straight, who live together but choose not to marry. Sobel’s domestic partnership bill would eliminate the patchwork of 18 registries enacted by counties such as Orange, Pinellas, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, and cities such as St. Petersburg, Tampa, Clearwater, North Miami and Miami Beach. Proponents testified before the Senate Children, Families and Elder Affairs Committee on Feb. 19, 2013, sharing stories about not being able to be with their partner at the hospital because they were not married. On the other side, members of religious groups, including Michael Sheedy, Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops public policy director, testified that the law would diminish traditional marriage. "In other jurisdictions where this has been enacted, we have seen that fewer people enter into marriage," Sheedy said. "They take it less seriously, it has less value in the minds of some." Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, asked Sheedy for more information about his claim that the number of marriages falls in places where domestic partnerships are in place. Sheedy said Spain came to mind. Clemens pressed him for any examples in the United States, and Sheedy said he could not think of any off the top of his head. We also wanted to know more about Sheedy’s statement. In a phone conversation the next day, he acknowledged not finding data about this happening in the United States. He did send us a few links from religious groups about the effect of gay marriage laws on traditional marriage in Spain and the Netherlands. "While other factors such as growing unemployment played a role, there is a strong case that redefining marriage is mostly responsible for the decline," Sheedy said. We wanted to examine his theory. Declining popularity of marriage Reports of marriage’s decline are not greatly exaggerated. Story after story has documented its waning popularity. According to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census data, 51 percent of American adults were married and 28 percent never had been as of December 2011. In 1960, 72 percent of adults were married and 15 percent never had been. The marriage decline is strongest among young adults. The trend is not at all isolated to Americans, Pew points out. Other post-industrial societies are seeing the same thing. Stephanie Coontz, feminist scholar and author, explored what’s behind the drop in U.S. marriages in a Los Angeles Times column in 2012: "Fifty years ago, getting married was a step young people took on the road to becoming economically secure, emotionally responsible and socially respectable. Today, it is more often the reward couples give themselves when they have achieved those goals. The vast majority of new marriages are between couples who have already cohabited. But many cohabiting couples refuse to marry until they are convinced that each partner has demonstrated his or her economic and emotional reliability." The European experience Spain and the Netherlands are countries frequently cited as examples of places where marriages declined when alternative options, in this case gay marriage, were offered. Scandinavian countries -- Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Sweden -- were first to introduce marriage-like rights for gay couples in the late 1980s and early ‘90s. In a 2004 essay, Stanley Kurtz, of the conservative Hoover Institute at Stanford University, argued these laws hastened the decline of marriage and the family, pointing to corresponding upticks in child wedlock and cohabitation with a declining marriage rate. "The rise of fragile families based on cohabitation and out-of-wedlock childbearing means that during the ‘90s, the total rate of family dissolution in Scandinavia significantly increased," he wrote for The Weekly Standard. Kurtz has debated this issue in public essays for years with an advocate for gay marriage, M.V. Lee Badgett, research director of the Williams Institute for Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA. She has criticized Kurtz’s analyses of marriage in Scandinavian countries, writing that marriage rates, divorce rates, and non-marital birth rates were already changing since the 1970s, in all post-industrial countries, regardless of whether they adopted same-sex partnership laws. In an interview, she said analyses like his don’t account for the number of people who are getting domestic partnerships and otherwise would not have gotten married. The New York Times documented the popularity of civil solidarity pacts in France, pointing out that 95 percent of the pacts were between heterosexual couples in 2009. (These pacts more closely mirror the legislation Sobel proposed.) The Times reported that there were two civil unions for every three marriages in France, Brad Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, pointed us to the World Family Map 2013, which shows cohabitation is more common, and marriage in less common, in countries that have civil unions. "Judging by the European experience, passage of civil unions laws appears to be linked to higher rates of cohabitation and lower rates of marriage," Wilcox said. "But it's possible that a weakening faith in marriage is driving all this, not any particular legislation." What about the U.S.? We could not find evidence of the trend Sheedy spoke about happening in the United States. We looked for apples-to-apples comparisons with the 10 states and D.C. that have passed civil unions or domestic partnership registries. In those states -- Oregon, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Maine, D.C., Wisconsin -- the marriage rate has fallen, but that is consistent with the national trend. It’s also not different from other declining state-by-state marriage rates from the CDC since 1990. Florida’s own rate is down from 10.9 (marriages per 1,000 people) to 7.4. Experts we consulted agreed on this point: There is no proven causative effect of the growth of domestic partnerships and declines in marriage. "No one has done research to look at trends at what happens with domestic partnerships," Badgett said. In an email interview, Coontz said the seeming correlation with the decline of marriage in most cases is due to more heterosexual couples avoiding or delaying marriage as attitudes about marriage alternatives become more accepting. "As that happens, countries tend to get more accepting of cohabitation and of recognizing same-sex partnerships," Coontz said. "But the one does not cause the other. They both reflect longer-terms trends in gender relations, social tolerance and the institution of marriage." Our ruling In opposing a bill that would allow for domestic partnerships statewide, Sheedy of the Florida Conference of Catholic Bishops said, "In other jurisdictions where this has been enacted, we have seen that fewer people enter into marriage." For domestic partnerships, he has offered no support in the United States, and no experts we consulted could find reports that vouch for that effect. In some countries, domestic partnership registries and gay marriage have increased while heterosexual marriage has decreased. But it’s not at all clear that the first trend is causing the second. In other words, correlation does not equal causation. Marriage is declining in popularity across the world, and has been for decades. No one has shown rates are declining directly because of domestic partnerships. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-08698	By releasing only basic tax information, former U.S. Congressman Nathan Deal is "hiding more than he's disclosed" about his business dealing with the state.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/08/emil-runge/deals-tax-returns-fuzzy-details-barnes-camp-says/	In recent weeks, Roy Barnes, the Democratic nominee for governor, has been goading GOP rival Nathan Deal to release his income tax returns. On Thursday, Deal put tax returns dating to 1981 on his campaign website. The returns include the federal 1040 form and the Georgia form 500, which outlines how much Deal, who resigned his seat in Congress earlier this year, paid to the state. The 2009 information contained six pages of information. Barnes, an attorney and former governor, released 141 pages of 2009 tax information. "By releasing only the cover pages of his returns -- Rep. Deal is hiding more than he's disclosed," Barnes campaign spokesman Emil Runge said in a statement the following day. Is Deal concealing more than he's making public? Bickering over income taxes is a time-honored political tradition. The Barnes camp is trying to score points on the issue primarily because of a controversial business arrangement of Deal's that has attracted much scrutiny. (No one has demanded Libertarian Party candidate John Monds' returns.) Barnes' website has a link to another site accusing Deal of trying to hide information about his income taxes. "The Barnes campaign is trying to find a chink in the armor and trying to expose it," said Bill Bozarth, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, a nonprofit government watchdog organization. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported last year that Deal and his business partner had a no-bid agreement with the state government to provide space for inspections of rebuilt vehicles and personally intervened with state officials to fight proposed changes to the operation. Deal resigned from his congressional job in March, scuttling an ethics investigation into the agreement. The AJC reported in July that a federal grand jury subpoenaed state Revenue Commissioner Bart Graham about a meeting he had with Deal about the agreement. Deal has said he has done nothing improper. He says he is not the target of a federal investigation. His spokesman, Brian Robinson, said the 1040 forms and financial disclosures to the State Ethics Commission and to Congress give the candidate's complete financial picture. "It shows how much he made and how much he paid in taxes," Robinson said. Deal's 2009 federal income form reports the candidate and his wife, Sandra, earned $153,753 in wages and salaries. Deal reported earning $29,024 in partnerships from his business interests. The couple's adjusted gross income, which includes pension, Social Security and other benefits, totaled $229,123. Deal has a handful of business interests that stem from his auto salvage business based in Gainesville. Business owners typically file a Schedule E form, which outlines income or losses from business partnerships, rental real estate, royalties, estates and trusts. Deal did not include that form on his campaign website. Some financial planners and accountants say that information would help. "The story is partially told on the first three pages [of Deal's return]," said Mitch Reiner, a certified financial planner who is chief operating officer of Capital Investment Advisors, based in Sandy Springs. "If I was advising a business owner, I would need more of their tax return to have a real clear picture." Roger Lusby III, an Alpharetta-based certified public accountant, said the Schedule E information is already included on line 17 of Deal's federal income tax form, which totaled $29,024. He doubted Deal's business partners would allow him to put the Schedule E form on his campaign website. "One certainly has the gist of what his income and his losses were derived from," said Lusby, managing partner of Frazier & Deeter, which describes itself as the second-largest independent CPA and advisory firm in Georgia. Deal campaign officials said they did not include the Schedule E form because they felt comfortable that the candidate's federal disclosure forms from his 18 years as a congressman, combined with this year's state disclosure form and his income tax form contained as much information as what is on the Schedule E. Scott Winkler, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant who owns his own firm, looked at several years worth of Deal's tax returns and Barnes' 2009 return for AJC PolitiFact Georgia. Winkler said he saw "nothing unusual" on either candidate's 2009 returns. Barnes, whose total income was about $5.1 million, did include a Schedule E form for his 2009 return on his campaign website. Most of it contains repairs and remodeling to his rental properties. There's also some information regarding four businesses in which Barnes lists himself as a partner. Barnes reported earning $24,296 from those businesses. The information includes some data about gains and losses from those companies. It does not show what percentage of ownership Barnes has in each company. Winkler said the Schedule E form from Deal's return would not say much, aside from how much money was earned or lost. "More detailed information isn't going to do a whole lot," Winkler said. Schedule E forms could contain supplemental documents further explaining the loss or gain from a particular investment. The Barnes camp wants Deal to release all of his schedule forms, which include capital gains and losses and alternative minimum taxes. They noted that Deal's 2008 tax returns show he was paid $75,000 from his auto salvage business, but a congressional cap limits outside income to $25,830. The Deal campaign said the $75,000 was mistakenly reported as wages when it was a dividend. Runge also noted that Deal reported earning slightly more money on his state disclosure form than on his 2009 income taxes. "The taxes he did release just raise more questions than they answer," Runge said in an e-mail. It's clear that Barnes provided more information from his tax returns than Deal. "[Barnes] has pretty much shown everything," Winkler said. However, much of Barnes' supplemental information involves his rental properties. The CPAs we spoke with said Deal's 2009 Schedule E form would include some more data about his business interests, but the grand totals are already on his 1040 form. Therefore, we believe to say Deal "is hiding more than he disclosed" is a nuanced proclamation. We rate the statement about Deal as Half True.

pomt-08361	"Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote" for the stimulus and the health care bill.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/26/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-attacks-michael-bennet-casting-deciding-vote-/	If you're seeking to tie your opponent to two controversial bills, what better way to do it than to say he cast the deciding vote to pass them? That's exactly what the National Republican Senatorial Committee is doing in the Colorado Senate race between incumbent Democrat Michael Bennet and GOP nominee Ken Buck. On Oct. 6, 2010, the Senate Republicans' campaign arm ran an ad attacking Bennet's role in helping pass two Democratic-sponsored bills, the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul. "One vote makes a difference," the narrator says. "Michael Bennet cast the deciding vote for Obama's stimulus that wasted billions, added to the debt and didn't create the jobs they promised. Bennet cast the deciding vote to allow passage of the trillion-dollar health care bill that slashed Medicare, hurting seniors. Bennet's vote was the key to billions in job-killing taxes, too. Michael Bennet: He's been their vote, not Colorado's." We won't tackle the ad's description of the substance of the two bills. (We've addressed some of those points in the past.) Instead, we'll look at whether it's fair to call Bennet the deciding vote on those bills. First, some background on how the bills passed. Both measures had long and roundabout legislative paths to President Barack Obama's desk, but we'll stick to the two votes the ad specifically references on screen. The stimulus vote cited in the ad was taken Feb. 13, 2009. It was to approve the conference report of the bill -- that is, the version that both chambers must pass with identical language. Once both chambers pass identical versions, the bill goes to the president to be signed. For the stimulus, the final vote was 60-38, with exactly the number of votes needed to meet the three-fifths supermajority required of most major actions in the Senate. Meanwhile, the health care vote mentioned in the ad was taken Dec. 23, 2009. The vote was to invoke cloture -- that is, to cut off debate so that consideration of the bill could proceed. Invoking cloture requires 60 votes, and in this case the Democrats once again got exactly the 60 votes required. The idea that the Democrats couldn't spare even a single vote is the crux of the NRSC's argument. "Absolutely Michael Bennet was the deciding vote," NRSC spokesman Brian Walsh told PolitiFact. "Had he not done so, they wouldn’t have passed the health care bill, regardless of whether he was first, middle or last to cast his vote. End of story." But is it? What about the argument that Bennet was merely one of 60 deciding votes. Couldn't the same charge be leveled at every member of the Senate who voted as Bennet did? We ran the issue by a variety of congressional scholars, and most agreed that it was a stretch for the NRSC to label Bennet's vote "the deciding vote." "That statement is misleading and a distortion of fact," said James Thurber, a political scientist at American University. Several experts we spoke to pointed to historical examples in which lawmakers waited until the last moment to help push the bill over the top. Norman Ornstein, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, pointed to President Bill Clinton's attempt to pass the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- a bill that critics loathe for raising taxes but which supporters praise for eventually producing surpluses in the latter part of the decade. Lacking any Republican support in Congress, the measure faced nail-biter votes in both chambers, with then-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, D-Pa., and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., attracting wide attention for remaining undecided until shortly before the votes and then ultimately voting yes. In Margolies-Mezvinsky's case, her loss the following year was universally blamed on that vote. Then there was the 1985 vote on President Ronald Reagan's budget by then-Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Wilson was wheeled onto the Senate floor wearing blue pajamas following surgery for a ruptured appendix. "That could be called a deciding vote," said Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution senior fellow emeritus. Indeed, there's a long and storied history of senators holding back on supporting a bill until certain demands are met, said Donald Ritchie, the historian of the Senate. This approach "takes some nerve, because the undecided vote may come under fire from both sides, but the rewards can sometimes be significant," Ritchie said. So, did Bennet's approval of the stimulus and the health care bill follow the same pattern? The short answer is no. On the stimulus, Bennet spoke favorably of the bill at least as early as Jan. 31, 2009 -- two weeks before he cast the vote cited in the ad -- when the Rocky Mountain News paraphrased him saying he "likes the overall direction of the legislation." He was part of a bipartisan group of 20 Senators trying to shrink the size of the stimulus, which suggests that he was sufficiently supportive of the bill that he was willing to work behind closed doors to see it succeed. His approach does not seem like that of a reluctant holdout. On health care, Bennet actually took to the Senate floor to forcefully criticize deals struck by party leaders on behalf of holdout Democratic Senators, hoping to persuade them to vote for the health care bill. "Columnists opposed to reform have criticized me for saying that I am willing to lose my seat to enact meaningful health care reform," he said on Dec. 21, 2010, two days before the vote. "Now, I am being asked why I didn't negotiate a special deal with leadership. In fact, there was a report this morning criticizing me because the National Republican Senatorial Committee was rejoicing that I did not ask for special favors. Only in Washington would someone be attacked for not negotiating a backroom deal. Just because others choose to engage in the same tired Washington rituals, doesn't mean that I have to." Bennet continued, "So I have a message for the columnists, the political professionals, and those back home. I am not happy about the backroom deals. I am not happy that the public option was held hostage by people in our own party. I do not support rewarding delay with special deals. I will let others justify their vote and their tactics." Indeed, as the health care debate came to a climax in the Senate, a stronger case can be made that any of several other senators deserve the title of the "deciding vote." In a Dec. 24, 2009, account tracing the health bill's Senate endgame, Noam N. Levey and Janet Hook of the Los Angeles Times cited Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., as a late holdout, due to his opposition to a proposal for a "Medicare buy-in." That policy would have allowed certain non-senior citizens to voluntarily join the federal health care plan for the elderly. According to the article, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., "knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward. Without the Medicare buy-in, Lieberman would be the 59th vote." At the meeting, Reid turned to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., "who had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal." Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to convince Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade. "Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience," the Los Angeles Times article reported. "And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md." And there was at least one more potential deciding vote -- the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. It wasn't a question of whether Byrd would support the bill but rather a question of whether he'd be physically able to reach the chamber to vote. Byrd had spent six weeks in the hospital earlier in 2009 with a staph infection. On the day of the vote, Byrd "was pushed onto the Senate floor in his plaid wheelchair," bundled in a coat, scarf and hat, according to an account in the New York Times. Lieberman, Nelson, Feingold, Byrd -- any of them could easily have been described as the deciding vote on the health care bill. So could any of the other 56 senators voting in favor. The NRSC ad "is true, but not very informative, since there were 60 deciding votes," concludes David W. Rohde, a Duke University political scientist. The NRSC ad would have been quite justified in describing Bennet's vote for either bill as "crucial" or "necessary" to passage of either bill, or even as "a deciding vote." But we can't find any rationale for singling Bennet out as "the deciding vote" in either case. He made his support for the stimulus bill known early on and was not a holdout on either bill. To ignore that and the fact that other senators played a key role in completing the needed vote total for the health care bill, leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression from message conveyed by the ad. As a result, we rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00160	Saudi Arabia has ordered $450 billion, "$110 billion of which is a military order," producing "over a million jobs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-touts-nonexistent-450-billion-saudi-o/	The death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Istanbul has drawn attention to America’s business interests in the Middle East kingdom. President Donald Trump brought money into the picture soon after Khashoggi disappeared, and has repeated the point several times since. In an Oct. 20 exchange with reporters, Trump called Saudi Arabia’s initial arrests and firings of top officials in the case a "good first step." As for how the United States should respond, Trump offered a dose of realpolitik. "With all that being said though, we have $450 billion, $110 billion of which is a military order, but this is equipment and various things ordered from Saudi Arabia, $450 billion," Trump said. "I think it's over a million jobs. That's not helpful for us to cancel an order like that. That hurts us far more than it hurts them." The $110 billion in arms sales to the Saudis would be eye-popping enough, but this was the first time we heard the $450 billion total that included everything else. Nor has Trump said that 1 million jobs are on the line. We decided to check those points. Key takeaways Saudi Arabia has not ordered $110 billion worth of military goods and services. Saudi Arabia has not ordered $450 billion worth of goods and services across the board. Over one million jobs are not at stake. Dubious defense sales The $110 billion in military contracts emerged from Trump’s 2017 meeting with King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Nayef of Saudi Arabia, and Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia. (Mohamed bin Salman is now crown prince and sits at the center of the speculation over the circumstances of Khashoggi’s death.) "President Trump and King Salman participated in the signing ceremony for almost $110 billion worth of defense capabilities," the White House announced. The press release said the arms package expanded opportunities for American companies in the region, "potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States." Note: Tens of thousands is a far cry from hundreds of thousands of jobs, but we’ll get back to that in a moment. The $110 billion itself is in doubt. "The $110 billion is not even remotely solid," said U.S. Naval War College professor Jonathan Caverley. "The State Department only counts $14.5 billion in implemented’ sales from this deal." And even that sum is suspect, Caverley added. The U.S. approved the sale of a $13.5 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system. Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel at the Brookings Institution in Washington said that deal is on shaky ground. "The Saudis let pass a September deadline for the deal with Lockheed Martin," Riedel recently wrote. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency oversees foreign military sales. Not counting the THAAD contract, its summary of sales to Saudi Arabia under Trump totals a little over $2 billion. Defense analyst Rachel Stohl at the Stimson Center, a private defense policy think tank, noted that the $110 billion rolled in some old offers. "Many of those were deals negotiated under the Obama administration, and only a small fraction have been filled," Stohl said. That’s the typical pattern for these announcements: Fanfare comes first, followed by a more modest reality. "President Obama offered Saudi Arabia something like $115 billion in arms while in office, and just about half of that resulted in sales," Jennifer Spindel, an international security professor at the University of Oklahoma, told us. And even sale agreements take a long time to play out. In the past 10 years, the United States and Saudi Arabia have had $85.5 billion in sales agreements, but only $24.5 billion in actual deliveries. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That time lag has major implications for jobs. A long runway for jobs Before we get into the dicey link between contracts and jobs in America, it’s important to note that some of the deals involve building things in Saudi Arabia, not the United States. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Commerce and Development touted partnerships in 2016 to build Black Hawk helicopters and space video surveillance satellites in the kingdom. So sales contracts don’t necessarily lead to manufacturing jobs in America. With that caveat, let’s look at the one year where we have estimates that tie jobs at home to all exports to Saudi Arabia, whether that’s planes, corn or software consultants. In 2015, the U.S. Commerce Department said exports "supported an estimated 165,000 jobs." That included both direct jobs and the knock-on effect of the money from those sales working through the economy. The same year, exports totalled $29.7 billion. Divide the jobs by the dollars and you find that for every dollar in exports, the United States gets .0000056 of a job. Which might not like sound like much, but obviously it does when you start talking about billions in sales. Now, if the $110 billion in arms sales were locked down and came in one single year, the math says they would generate more than 600,000 jobs. Here’s why that isn’t in the cards. We know the $110 billion is at best aspirational, but the other big issue is that military contracts play out over many years. The arms experts we reached said smaller ones of about $200 to $300 million typically take three to four years for completion. The bigger systems take much longer. "A decade is the ballpark in terms of minimum time between initial signing of a deal and the delivery of the capability, with money disbursed across the life of the contract," Caverley at the War College said. "It will probably take even longer given the new Saudi requirements that 50 percent of the work needs to be performed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia will have to develop a massive amount of defense industrial capability that currently does not exist in order to handle this work." Even if Saudi Arabia bought everything it said it wanted, the yearly jobs impact would be more in the range of 60,000 to 120,000. That’s not close to the hundreds of thousands Trump has talked about. The $450 billion mystery Trump said that all told, Saudi Arabia has $450 billion in orders from the United States. We asked the White House and the U.S. - Saudi Arabian Business Council for any data on this. We did not hear back. Total exports of goods and services in 2017 were $25.4 billion. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Hossein Askari, a business professor at George Washington University, analyzes international trade in the Middle East. He knows of no tally of contracts to back up Trump’s assertion. "There is absolutely no such number that could support the $450 billion," Askari said. Our ruling Trump said that Saudi Arabia has ordered $450 billion from U.S. companies, including $110 billion in military contracts, representing over a million jobs. Orders on that scale don’t exist. There is no data behind the $450 billion, and the $110 billion is a blend of smaller deals in progress, old offers that have not come through, and speculative discussions that have yet to move forward. Trump’s claims about jobs ignores the long runway between signed agreements and actual delivery and payment. He treats spending that could play out over a decade as if it were spent in one year. More importantly, if the $450 billion in orders is a mirage, the 1 million jobs is equally without substance. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03531	The federal government could save $500 million annually by circulating $1 coins instead of $1 bills.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/31/charlie-smith/too-much-value-placed-one-report-about-1-coins/	You have to spend money to make money. And one former Georgia lawmaker offers that advice to the federal government. Charlie Smith, a former state representative from St. Mary’s, says if the U.S. really wants to save money, it would replace the $1 bill with the not-so-popular $1 coin. Smith, now an attorney with a Brunswick firm, has been beating this drum for years. He kept the momentum going this month in a newspaper article. Smith told a Brunswick News reporter that the federal government could save $500 million a year by circulating $1 coins instead of $1 bills, and that there were four studies to support the savings claim. At PolitiFact, we’re fond of money, be it paper or coin. So Smith’s savings claim was intriguing. We decided to investigate further. During his 10 years in the state Legislature, Smith was a floor leader for then-Gov. Roy Barnes. These days he’s still leading, but he admits his coin cause is almost unwinnable. "They’ve started calling me Charlie ‘Don Quixote’ Smith because I’m fighting windmills," he told us about his campaign to phase out $1 bills. Smith said he was slightly misquoted in the Brunswick News article. He did say the government could save $500 million a year with the $1 coins, but that amount was cited in just one study. And since then the savings figure has been revised downward. The studies that Smith references are those done by the independent, nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office, which works for Congress and acts as a watchdog for how the federal government spends taxpayers’ money. The GAO has released several reports over the past decade on the net benefit to the government of replacing the $1 bill with a $1 coin. A report released in 2000 included the $500 million annual savings figure that Smith mentions. But since that year, the GAO studies have estimated less in annual savings. Last year, in testimony before a congressional committee, the GAO estimated a savings of about $4.4 billion over 30 years, or an average of about $150 million per year. It also repeated a recommendation that the dollar bill be phased out over a four-year transition period. The savings included in the studies is based on economics. Coins last longer than paper bills, and dollar coins don’t cost more than they are worth to produce (for example, it costs more than twice the face value of the penny and nickel to produce them). The life span of a dollar coin is 30 years. On the other hand, it costs 5.4 cents to produce every $1 bill, which has a life span of 5.9 years. Despite the savings, there’s a problem. People don’t like the coins. Toward the end of last year, there were $1.4 billion in dollar coins piled up in Federal Reserve vaults. Like Smith, other proponents of the $1 coin disagree with the GAO’s latest and much lower annual savings figures. A GAO report released in November said the $1 coin hadn’t really caught on with the public because the $1 bill was still in circulation. Also, savings were lower partly because new equipment to process the bills was allowing for a longer life span. (Early studies had listed the $1 bill’s life span at about 18 months). And the government was going to cut back on production of the coins and use the extra coins already in storage. "We think (the federal government) is gaming the numbers a bit," Shawn Smeallie, executive director of the Dollar Coin Alliance, says about the lower savings figures. The Federal Reserve improvements to increase the dollar bill’s life span haven’t been implemented yet, Smeallie says, and he thinks the costs for producing the coins is overstated. His group estimates the annual savings of the bill-to-coin switch would be about $366 million. The Dollar Coin Alliance -- a mix of vendors, mass transit agencies and trade associations that could benefit from the change -- is pushing for a Senate hearing this session for a bill on the change. Whatever happens, Smith is doing his best to circulate the coins in his hometown. But even there, where his crusade is well-known, he gets some pushback from people who don’t want the "Charlie coins." And when he travels to Atlanta and passes the coins off to cashiers, they usually ask whether he’s been riding MARTA. The public transit agency gives change in the $1 coins. So does Smith’s claim add up? The former state lawmaker said that circulating $1 coins instead of $1 bills could save the federal government $500 million a year. A newspaper featuring Smith’s story and statements misquoted the former state lawmaker and overstated his claim. One of the several federal studies, completed over a decade ago, about the bill-to-coin switch does include the $500 million savings estimate. Other studies since then have included lower savings claims. The overarching point of Smith’s statement was the potential savings of the $1 currency change. This is true. Moving to coins from paper money would save taxpayers’ money in the long run. But Smith cherry-picked the study with the largest amount of savings. He cited $500 million. The most recent study showed the saving at about $150 million, far less than Smith cited. We rated Smith’s claim Half True.	None	Charlie Smith	None	None	None	2013-05-31T00:00:00	2013-05-06	['None']

pomt-07379	Says although the unemployment rate seems to be improving, it does not reflect real job creation -- it’s caused by a "shrinking of the actual labor force."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/04/arianna-huffington/arianna-huffington-says-unemployment-gains-are-act/	On the May 1, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Arianna Huffington -- founder of the liberal news and opinion website The Huffington Post -- threw some cold water on the recent drop in the unemployment rate. Between October 2010 and March 2011 -- when unemployment measures have declined most consistently recently -- the rate has fallen from 9.7 percent to 8.8 percent. That has cheered the Obama Administration, which argues that the numbers are concrete evidence of an improving economy. But Huffington expressed caution about what these numbers really mean, pointing out a complicating factor in how the unemployment rate is calculated -- one that raises questions about whether the administration’s optimistic interpretation is accurate. Here’s what Huffington said: "What's happening in the country with jobs, basically, despite the fact that supposedly, you know, we have a reduction in unemployment. We know this is really a statistical reason because of the shrinking of the actual labor force, but not any real creation of jobs." We’ve streamlined what Huffington said for clarity’s sake and will use that for our fact-check: Although the unemployment rate seems to be improving, she indicated, it does not reflect real job creation -- the improvement is actually caused by a shrinking labor force. This gets a bit complicated, so bear with us. We’ll start with the way the government’s official arbiter of employment statistics, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, calculates the unemployment rate. BLS determines how many Americans are looking for work, excluding people who have taken themselves out of the labor force, either temporarily or permanently -- for instance, if they are leaving jobs to return to school full time, taking time off to raise children, retiring, taking time to travel long-term or simply living off their savings for a stretch. BLS takes the number of Americans who are unemployed but still looking for work and divides it by the "workforce" -- working Americans plus those who are jobless but looking for work. The result is the unemployment rate. So, the unemployment rate can be shaped by two distinct factors -- the number of unemployed Americans and the number of Americans working or looking for work. If the number of jobless Americans declines and the size of the work force doesn’t change much, the unemployment rate will fall. But if the size of the workforce falls at a fast enough rate, even a decline in the number of jobless Americans can actually lead to a rising unemployment rate. Enough with the theory -- let’s turn to the actual numbers. Between October 2010 and March 2011, the unemployment level -- the numerator used to determine the unemployment rate -- has declined from 14,876,000 in October to 13,542,000 in March. Meanwhile, the civilian work force -- the denominator -- has declined over the same period from 153,960,000 to 153,406,000. And as we indicated, the unemployment rate has declined during that period from 9.7 percent to 8.8 percent. So, over that period, unemployment fell by 1,334,000 people, but it did so for two separate reasons. On the one hand, 554,000 left the work force and, by the logic of the BLS statistic, were no longer counted as "unemployed." On the other hand, 780,000 people secured jobs. Comparing those two numbers, then, we can say that about 0.5 of the 0.9 percentage-point decline in the unemployment rate was due to people actually getting jobs, and the remaining 0.4 points was due to people leaving the workforce, either because they gave up on their job search or for other reasons, such as retirement. End of story? Not yet. This calculation assumes that the labor force at least should stay the same size from month to month. In fact, economists say that to keep pace with population growth, the labor force has to grow from month to month -- according to one popular estimate, by 100,000 every month. So when the labor force declined from October to March by 554,000, that actually underestimated the migration away from the labor force. The real hit to the work force over that period was more than 1 million Americans. This gets complicated to calculate, so economists sometimes use a different statistic instead -- the employment-to-population ratio. This shows what percentage of the 16-and-over population has a job. The EPOP (as it’s commonly called) fell significantly during the most recent recession, meaning that a smaller share of the population held jobs. In fact, the last time labor force participation has been this low was in the mid 1980s -- a quarter-century ago. This is the statistic that Huffington cited when we reached her. She first referred us to a blog post by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman that bemoaned the sluggish EPOP. She later followed up with a flurry of other articles and economic blog posts that made this point. So we’re left to decide whether it’s better to trust the traditional BLS statistics or EPOP. It’s a tough call. The advantage of EPOP is that it solves the population growth problem, which is not a trivial factor, particularly when you’re talking about a span of several months. The drawback is that it counts as unemployed people who have chosen that course on a truly voluntary basis -- going back to school, raising kids and so on. That overestimates the genuine unemployment rate. On balance, we think (and experts across the ideological spectrum tell us) that both measures are imperfect, but valid. This leaves us with Huffington’s specific comment. The main shortcoming is in her phrasing. She says that there has "not (been) any real creation of jobs." There’s a legitimate argument to be made about whether the economy is creating enough jobs to keep the economy humming, but we don’t think it’s accurate to say that there’s been no job creation. Over the period we studied, the economy created 700,000-plus jobs, which is not only an increase in absolute terms but is also a pace that exceeded the amount experts say is necessary to keep up with population growth. It’s been modest job growth, perhaps, but not zero. On the other hand, Huffington’s broader point -- that unemployment statistics can be affected by workers’ departure from the labor market -- is an important one, and one that’s often overlooked outside the world of professional economists. No less an authority than the Federal Reserve Board of Governors took note of this reality during its March meeting. According to the minutes of the meeting, "several participants noted that the drop in unemployment was attributable more to people withdrawing from the labor force and to fewer layoffs than to increased hiring." "There has been some growth in employment, but not as much as the headline-figure drop in the unemployment rate would initially suggest, and labor-force participation has dropped during the recession," said James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "There are caveats you could add to make the statement more complete, but as a one-sentence summary it is not far off the mark." Ultimately, we agree that Huffington is largely correct that the unemployment rate is affected by people leaving the workforce, not just by job creation, even if she has slightly exaggerated its extent. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Arianna Huffington	None	None	None	2011-05-04T12:49:35	2011-05-01	['None']

pomt-12296	"We are seeing poverty being reduced in south St. Pete at a number larger than the national average, the state average, county or Tampa and Jacksonville."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/jun/27/rick-kriseman/krisemans-claim-about-poverty-south-st-petersburg-/	Mayor Rick Kriseman is trying to win over voters in his reelection bid with a pitch about falling poverty in a lower income neighborhood. Kriseman, who faces former Mayor Rick Baker, says significant strides have been made since he took office, particularly in south St. Petersburg. "We are seeing poverty being reduced in south St. Pete at a number larger than the national average, the state average, county or in Tampa, Jacksonville," Kriseman said after signing his qualifying papers inside City Hall. This area of town is significant to Kriseman, who helped with efforts related to the 2020 plan, a five-year plan to reduce poverty by 30 percent in a portion of south St. Petersburg. This isn’t the first time Kriseman has made this point, so we decided to find out if poverty really is going down in south St. Petersburg. Kriseman’s claim rests on shaky evidence that doesn’t tell the whole story. Kriseman’s data is about population, not geography In order for this claim to be true, the poverty rate in south St. Petersburg would have to be dropping faster than in those other areas he named. But Kriseman’s evidence for the claim is imprecise. Instead of providing data for that area, Kriseman pinpointed the poverty rate of the African-American population in the entire city of St. Petersburg between two years. Kriseman’s staff relied on a 2013 Pinellas County report that highlighted south St. Petersburg as one of five at-risk communities, areas marked by "high concentrations of poverty and a small return to the taxbase." According to the report, approximately 48 percent of the population in this zone live in poverty. The demographic breakdown of those who live in poverty is as follows: 63 percent are African-American, 27 percent are white, 5 percent are Hispanic, and 5 percent are of another race. City staff said given that the majority of residents in that zone are African-American, addressing poverty among African-Americans is a priority for the mayor. So to support his claim, Kriseman compared the poverty rate for the entire St. Petersburg black population (which should go without saying, does not entirely live in south St. Pete) against the rates of other big cities, the state and the country. Even with that allowance, the numbers don’t hold up. Kriseman’s evidence not statistically significant Kriseman’s team sent PolitiFact Florida two sets of data from the Census Bureau’s 2014 and 2015 American Community Survey for the African-American population. (The 2016 numbers will not be released until September.) According to that data, the black poverty rate in St. Petersburg decreased by 8.5 percentage points between 2014 and 2015, from 34.9 percent to 26.4 percent. The other areas Kriseman mentioned — Pinellas County, Jacksonville, Florida, the United States, and Tampa — showed a smaller reduction in the black poverty rate, between a drop of 4.8 percentage points to a gain of .2 point, respectively. (The numbers listed on the graph represent percentage points — not the percentage.) (Graph provided by city staff.) This data may look convincing, but it's not as certain as Kriseman describes. Most importantly, the data neglects the large margin of error in census data. Based on our calculations, the difference in the number of African-Americans in poverty — for St. Petersburg as well as the other locations — was statistically unchanged from 2014 to 2015. In other words, there's no way to know for sure if poverty went up or down, because the change in the poverty rate is within the margin of error. The margin of error fluctuates from year to year. In 2015, the margin of error for data from the Census Bureau was plus or minus 25 percent, or 4,131 people. For 2014, the margin of error was plus or minus 17 percent, or 3,459 people. Those margins are significant. The Census Bureau data shows that about 17,000 African-Americans were in poverty in 2015. With the margin of error, the estimated range is between 12,566 and 20,828. The range of African-Americans in poverty in 2014 is between 16,596 and 23,514. Taken together, the estimates show that the number of African-Americans in poverty could have held steady, or even increased from 17,000 to 20,000. We just don't know with a margin of error this wide. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com (Nathaniel Lash | Tampa Bay Times) Joshua Wilde, an assistant professor of economics at the University of South Florida, said Kriseman was using the best data available despite its imperfections. While he couldn't say this for sure, he said there was a strong chance that poverty fell in south St. Petersburg among African-Americans between 2014-15. He calculated the p-value — a statistical indicator based on the confidence interval — to determine the chance poverty fell based on numbers provided by the Census Bureau. "Once you peel back the layers of the onion on the numbers, it turns out the best numbers we have are just highly uncertain," he said. Still, Melissa Radey, a Florida State University professor who specializes in poverty research and data, said it would be better to have more years when looking at trends in poverty. "Making statements about trends is not appropriate with only two years of data," Radey said. Even looking at additional years for those locations, there really is no takeaway trend. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Kriseman stuck by his conclusion despite the uncertainty in the numbers. "To dismiss the year over year Census report about the number of people in poverty as statistically insignificant overgeneralizes the complexities of real-time poverty eradication," he said. He cited a 2016 Tampa Bay Times article that highlighted Census Bureau data that showed that overall poverty rates in the Tampa Bay area have dropped to their lowest levels since the Great Recession. More specifically, the article said that poverty among African-Americans in Pinellas County dropped significantly from 2014-15. The article, however, did not specifically look at the south St. Petersburg population. Our ruling Kriseman said, "We are seeing poverty being reduced in south St. Pete at a number larger than the national average, the state average, county or Tampa and Jacksonville." The statement is flawed from the start. To support his claim about south St. Petersburg — which is not entirely comprised of black residents — Kriseman referred to data about the city's overall black population, not even narrowed down to the south side. That data has problems. At face value, 2014 Census data showed a decrease in the poverty rate for the city’s African-American population through 2015. But that ignores critical facts, including the wide margin of error for Census city data that indicates there is no discernible difference between the years Kriseman highlighted. A more comprehensive look at five years of data does not show a strong trend either way. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give the reader a different impression, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08223	"Congressman Ryan has secured a grand total of $116,838,763 to date (for the Mahoning Valley) and has an additional $27,095,000 pending in FY2010 spending bills."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/17/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-not-shy-about-bringing-home-bacon/	You can say what you like about spending and pork, but delivering for the district by bringing home the bacon is a badge of honor for many members of Congress. It's the reason why Rep. Tim Ryan's campaign boasts that the Niles Democrat "has secured a grand total of $116,838,763 to date and has an additional $27,095,000 pending in Fiscal Year 2010 spending bills. "That means more money to help promote economic growth, strengthen America’s infrastructure and improve the quality of life in the Mahoning Valley," the statement adds, with an exclamation point. More than $143 million is a lot of kapusta, or cabbage, as they might say in the valley. PolitiFact Ohio asked Ryan’s staff to back up the figures, and the congressman's communications director, Heather McMahon, said they were actually outdated and understated. She said that appropriations for the 17th District, "as secured by Congressman Tim Ryan in his eight years in office," total $140,133,763 -- with an additional $40,200,000 pending in the Fiscal Year 2011 budget. And, she said, "The figures do not include other grants and funds that Congressman Ryan has assisted in bringing to the 17th District" -- notably a $20 million Department of Transportation grant signed last summer for the Kent Central Gateway project. Saying that Ryan has "secured" funding "means that the congressman submitted each project to the appropriate subcommittee as a piece of congressionally directed spending that has been attached to his name," McMahon said. "Projects that receive funding must be approved by subcommittee, the House appropriations committee, and also the full House." The directed appropriations she is describing are better known as earmarks. Ryan was well-positioned to secure them as a member since 2006 of the powerful House Committee on Appropriations and as a member of the defense appropriations subcommittee, another key panel. He topped the list of lawmakers who scored the highest dollar amounts in the House's defense bill for fiscal 2011, according to research by the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense and the newspaper The Hill. Critics say earmarks contribute to runaway spending, and contend legislators can improperly use earmarks to enrich themselves. Ryan’s view is that earmarks are a way to direct federal dollars to worthwhile local projects and that they account for a tiny percentage of the federal budget. Ryan's office provided an overview of funding he secured in nine budget categories, with example projects. Defense topped the list, with a total of $61,154,000 passed and signed. The money included $17.5 million in earmarks for fiscal 2007, which Ryan inserted into a Defense Department spending bill, for Lockheed Martin's development in Akron of a high-altitude airship. Detailed breakdowns appear on Ryan's congressional website. The figures match those listed by critics of earmarks, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the Center for Responsive Politics.

pomt-09966	"The president of the United States ... agrees with me" that marriage should be between a man and a woman.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/12/miss-california-usa/miss-usa-runner-carrie-prejeans-comments-same-sex-/	It's not often that we can check a Miss USA contestant with our Truth-O-Meter. So when Miss California USA Carrie Prejean, the runner-up in the Miss USA competition, likened her much-discussed, pageant-night response to a question about gay marriage to President Barack Obama's beliefs, we decided it was time. The similarity of the statements made by Miss California and Obama was raised during a May 12 news conference in which pageant owner Donald Trump announced that Prejean could retain her crown as Miss California USA even though she failed to reveal she had posed in her underwear as a teenager. The Donald also came to Prejean's defense about her gay marriage comments. "It's the same answer that the president of the United States gave," Trump said. "She gave an honorable answer. She gave an answer from her heart." Said Prejean: "I was given a question asking for my opinion and I stated my honest belief. Not only do I hold this belief but, as Mr. Trump said, the president of the United States, the secretary of state and many Americans agree with me in this belief." Let's roll the tape on Prejean's statement during the Miss USA competition on April 19, 2009. One of the celebrity judges, Perez Hilton, asked whether other states should follow Vermont's lead in legalizing same-sex marriage. Here's the part of Prejean's answer that matters: "I think in my country, in my family, I think that I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that's how I was raised." Controversy followed. So let's see how that stacks up to Obama's stated position on same-sex marriage: * "You know, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman." (an interview with ABC's Jake Tapper, June 16, 2008) * "I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian, it's also a sacred union. You know, God's in the mix." (an interview with Rev. Rick Warren, Aug. 16, 2008) * "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage." (an MTV interview, Nov. 1, 2008) Sounds about the same to us. Now, we should note that with all of these quotes during the presidential campaign, Obama quickly followed up by noting his support for civil unions. The Jake Tapper interview is as representative of Obama's fuller position as any. In it, Obama said, "I'm a strong supporter of civil unions. ... You know, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, but I also think that same-sex partners should be able to visit each other in hospitals, they should be able to transfer property, they should be able to get the same federal rights and benefits that are conferred onto married couples. And so, you know, as president, my job is to make sure that the federal government is not discriminating and that we maintain the federal government's historic role in not meddling with what states are doing when it comes to marriage law." Compare that to Prejean's comments to Fox's Greta Van Susteren on April 30. "My thought on civil unions? You know what, Greta, I don't have the answers to everything. I'm not running for political office. I don't have the answers to everything, you know, in the world out there. But I think that there should be rights for people, you know, especially in California. I think that people that are homosexual should have some rights, you know, hospital rights, and things like that." Granted, her answer may not be as nuanced as Obama's. As she said, she's not running for public office. Still, her fuller position also sounds an awful lot like Obama's. But what Prejean said after the pageant isn't the issue. Prejean and The Donald said the position she took the night of the pageant is consistent with President Obama's position. And we rate that claim True.

pomt-14453	"There’s no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections."	true	/punditfact/statements/2016/mar/06/david-brooks/david-brooks-said-primary-turnout-doesnt-predict-g/	Republican candidates and party leaders have touted high voter turnout in the GOP primary as a good sign for the general election, but conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks isn’t so sure. "There’s no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections," Brooks said on Meet the Press on March 6. Is Brooks right that the GOP’s numbers, which surpass Democratic turnout, mean little for the general election? We didn’t hear back from Brooks, but the data shows and experts agree that more votes in the nominating contests aren’t necessarily harbingers of November victories. Turn out for what It’s important to note that not all 11 presidential cycles had competitive primary contests on both sides. Primary turnout was low in five elections simply because one party’s nomination was locked up by incumbent presidents, and thus not predictive of general election results. In 1984, for example, the Democratic primary turned out about three times more voters than the Republican primary. Nonetheless, President Ronald Reagan won re-election with almost 60 percent of the popular vote. In the six elections where there were contests on both sides, the party with the higher primary voter turnout won the popular vote just three times. In 1976, 1992 and 2008, Democratic primary turnout surpassed that of the GOP nominating race, and the Democratic candidates won the general election. Here’s a chart showing this, compiled with data from the Federal Election Commission and a few other sources. (Bold indicates the party that won in the general election, and an asterisk indicates an election where both parties had competitive primary contests.) GOP primary votes (% of voting age population) Dem primary votes (% of voting age population) 2012 19,530,335 (9.5 percent) 8,571,580 (6.1 percent) 2008* 20,790,899 (10.7 percent) 37,235,154 (21.0 percent) 2004 7,940,331 (6.3 percent) 15,975,066 (10.8 percent) 2000* 17,156,117 (10.6 percent) 14,045,745 (9.7 percent) 1996 14,233,939 (9.1 percent) 10,883,909 (8.6 percent) 1992* 12,696,547 (8.8 percent) 20,239,385 (14.1 percent) 1988* 12,165,115 (9.1 percent) 22,961,936 (17.0 percent) 1984 6,563,029 (6.6 percent) 18,009,217 (17.3 percent) 1980* 12,690,451 (11.3 percent) 18,747,825 (14.7 percent) 1976* 10,374,125 (11.5 percent) 16,052,652 (17.6 percent) 1972 6,175,199 (8.4 percent) 15,993,965 (20.8 percent) In the other three elections, more votes in the primary didn’t lead to more votes in the general. About 6 million more votes were cast for the Democratic nomination in 1980, but Republican Ronald Reagan won about 8.5 million votes in the general election. Similarly, in 1988, Democratic turnout was almost double that of GOP turnout in the primaries, but George H.W. Bush won the election with about 7 million more votes. And in 2000, about 3 million more voters turned out for the Republican primary, but George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore. (Bush won the electoral college and thus the election.) Primary causes Though it may not be the single predictor of a general election win, enthusiasm in the nominating contests is still meaningful. Democratic turnout this election cycle may be lower because the contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is simply not as competitive or diverse as the Republican race. Exit polls show that the vast majority of voters in the Democratic primary are satisfied with either Clinton or Sanders, pointed out Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and turnout guru. "On the Republican side, 50 percent or less say that," McDonald said, pointing out that some are casting ballots in the GOP primary to vote against a candidate as much as they're there to vote for one. "Voters see stark differences between the candidates, and they’re not as happy if the opposing candidate would win." Overall though, more votes in the primaries may not mean much in what will be a highly competitive general election, according to McDonald. He pointed out that the Democrats, while not turning up at the primary polls in droves, are still highly engaged. "Those numbers have got to be pleasing and there are good reasons why the Republicans will be able to leverage the turnout. But I don’t think it means they’re going to win," he said. "I would have to agree with (Brooks) on this." Our ruling Brooks said, "There’s no correlation between primary turnout and wins in the fall in the last 11 elections." There were competitive primaries on both sides in six out of the past 11 elections. In three of those six elections, the party that saw more votes in nomination contest also got more votes in the general. We rate Brooks’ claim True.

pomt-05313	"Victory! Republicans by 2 to 1 vote to endorse Mark Neumann on first ballot at GOP convention."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/17/mark-neumann/senate-candidate-mark-neumann-says-state-republica/	He finished second in a bid for for the Republican Party of Wisconsin’s endorsement, but that didn’t stop U.S. Senate candidate Mark Neumann from declaring himself top dog in separate fundraising appeals. "Victory! Republicans by 2 to 1 vote to endorse Mark Neumann on first ballot at GOP convention!," a pop-up appeal covering Neumann’s website said. "Join the Republican Party and conservative activists who voted to endorse Mark." That sounds an awful lot like Neumann walked away with the party endorsement -- and on the first ballot. No mention was made, on the website or in an email fundraising appeal, of the fact that not only did Neumann not win the endorsement -- no candidate reached the 60 percent voting threshhold to claim the prize. So has down come to mean up? In the spin zone, yes. But not on the Truth-O-Meter. Neumann, a businessman and former congressman, finished first in the first of three ballots at the party gathering. Each round of balloting narrowed the four-person field by one candidate. Businessman Eric Hovde dropped off first, then, in a surprise, former Gov. Tommy Thompson fell out. That left Neumann and Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald in the final runoff. But neither one passed the 60 percent threshold needed to win the party’s nod and nobody emerged with the endorsement. Fitzgerald actually edged Neumann with 51.5 percent. (We rated a related Fitzgerald claim of a "win" at the convention Mostly True) What about Neumann’s claim of "victory" related to the "2 to 1 vote to endorse" him. He argues he won the most telling vote, when all four candidates were on the ballot for delegates, as they will be when facing voters in the September 2012 primary. In that first round, Neumann had 42 percent, Fitzgerald 21 percent, Thompson 20 percent and Hovde 16 percent. That’s the 2-to-1 margin, Neumann’s camp says. But that’s only true if you compare his share to any one of his rivals. Neumann didn’t win 65 or 70 percent of the vote, as his "2-to-1" claim suggests. Neumann was the frontrunner on the first two ballots, but his support stalled in the upper 40s, while Fitzgerald’s jumped to the slim majority in the final round. Neumann never got even a majority, much less 60 percent. Some observers -- and Neumann’s camp -- say Thompson and Hovde supporters voted tactically with Fitzgerald to deny Neumann the endorsement on later ballots. It’s clear Neumann had something to crow about. He vanquished Thompson, the frontrunner in the polls, and led the pack on the earliest ballot. But that’s like declaring victory at the first turn and not the finish line. Neumann was runner-up on the final vote. And it’s highly misleading to say he was "endorsed" by delegates when no such endorsement was made. We rate Neumann’s "victory" and "endorsement" claim False.

pomt-13164	Says HB2 "hasn’t moved the needle one iota" on North Carolina’s economy.	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/28/john-skvarla/top-north-carolina-economic-official-says-hb2-has-/	The top economic official in Gov. Pat McCrory’s administration said North Carolina’s controversial "bathroom bill" has done nothing to the state economy. Commerce Secretary John Skvarla said in a speech Monday that as far as North Carolina’s economic health is concerned, House Bill 2 "hasn’t moved the needle one iota." He went on to say that publicity over the law does not match its actual impact. The word "iota" that Skvarla used is defined as "a very small amount" or "an infinitesimal amount." So clearly Skvarla is confident the law has had basically zero effect on the state economy. We previously rated a claim that HB2 had cost North Carolina $500 million as False. The downfall of that claim was it cited a study that said North Carolina might lose more than $500 million, not that it already had. At the time we found a more accurate estimate of losses was between $77 million and $201 million. Since then hits have continued to come, including more job losses and the NBA, NCAA and ACC pulling postseason games out of North Carolina. Yet at the same time, North Carolina has a large population and economy. Could it be true that the losses haven’t really left a mark? Arguments on his side North Carolina’s GDP is around $510 billion. So even a $500 million loss would only represent 0.1 percent of that. And even after HB2 passed and the backlash became apparent, CNBC rated North Carolina the fifth-best state for business. And the trade publication Site Selection Magazine ranked North Carolina and Texas as tied for the title of "most competitive state." The magazine interviewed Skvarla, including a question about HB2. Skvarla responded he believes concerned business leaders are simply misinformed (if so, they can read our fact-checks on HB2 here), and that his office tries to remind them of the many successful companies in North Carolina. He also mentions the state’s educated populace. "The key factor often comes down to North Carolina’s talented and skilled workers," Skvarla said. But is that the whole story? HB2 and jobs No major companies have said they came to North Carolina because of HB2, so it certainly hasn’t helped on that front. And several have announced they stopped planned growth out of protest. The two most prominent were PayPal and Deutsche Bank, which canceled 400 new jobs in Charlotte and 250 new jobs in Cary, respectively. Given the average salaries they had promised, those jobs would’ve paid workers in those two cities nearly $42 million every year. That’s nothing to scoff at, even if the jobs themselves would not have had much of an impact on the two cities’ unemployment rates. Kim Genardo, a spokeswoman for Skvarla, said the losses have been more than offset by other companies announcing jobs since then. "In one fell swoop the CSX announcement this summer in Edgecombe County is more than triple that (PayPal) jobs number," she said. That’s a possibility. The train company itself will only employ 150 people when it opens a new shipping hub in 2020, but the company said it thinks it will lead to the creation of about 1,500 jobs elsewhere in the state. The state plans to pay CSX $122.1 million in incentives. Yet on the same day Skvarla made his claim about HB2, real estate analytics firm CoStar Group announced it would bring 730 jobs to Richmond, Virginia – with an estimated economic impact of $250 million. David Dorsch, a Charlotte real estate broker who had worked with the company, told the Charlotte Business Journal that CoStar had been leaning toward Charlotte. "The primary reason they chose Richmond over Charlotte was HB2," he was quoted as saying. The PayPal, Deutsche Bank and CoStar losses add up to nearly 1,400 jobs. And the chambers of commerce in Raleigh and Asheville blame HB2 for losing an additional 1,500 jobs from unnamed companies. Losses below the radar Other companies skip North Carolina without an announcement, said consultant Dennis Donovan. He’s a partner with Wadley Donovan Gutshaw Consulting in New Jersey, which helps businesses pick new locations. Donovan called Skvarla’s claim "patently false." A finance company and a manufacturing company he works with have decided not to consider North Carolina because of HB2, Donovan said – "and we're a small sample size, so you’ve got to imagine there are many companies out there feeling the same." Donovan said personal beliefs don’t matter: If a company thinks being in North Carolina will hurt its brand, or its ability to hire and keep the best employees, it’s an easy business decision to go elsewhere. Sports losses Beyond the job losses are the state’s lost tourism dollars. We can’t account for individuals moving their vacations due to HB2, but we do know about major events that were cancelled. Four of the state’s seven largest cities’ chambers of commerce – Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and Cary – have come out against the the law. Lost conferences and concerts harmed all of them, as did sporting events. Charlotte estimates it lost $100 million when the NBA moved its All Star Game, and $30 million from the loss of the ACC football championship. Greensboro estimated it lost $15 million from various NCAA games, and Cary has said it already lost $2 million and will likely lose millions more since the NCAA is currently deciding where to put games through the 2021-22 season. Our ruling North Carolina has undeniably lost money and jobs due to HB2, so Skvarla’s claim that the law "hasn’t moved the needle one iota" on the economy seems incorrect at first glance. On a macro scale, however, Skvarla has a point. Even hundreds of millions of dollars in losses won’t dent the state’s GDP very much. And the now-canceled jobs would not have had much of an impact on the overall unemployment rate. Yet many local economies – particularly in Wake and Mecklenburg counties, the state’s two largest – have felt the sting of hundreds of jobs lost, that would have provided tens of millions of dollars in annual wages. That would have helped the economy. So would the tens of thousands of sports fans who will now spend their money in other states.

pomt-09015	"Subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies. Just cutting the oil and gas subsidies out would save the U.S. government $45 billion every year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/09/keith-olbermann/olbermann-says-oil-and-gas-subsidies-account-88-pe/	The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has brought renewed attention to government subsidies conferred upon the oil and gas industry. Keith Olbermann, the liberal host of the MSNBC prime-time show Countdown, took the issue of the oil and gas industry head-on during the show that aired July 6, 2010. He cited reports by the Center for American Progress -- a liberal think tank -- that outlined "nine different subsidies that the U.S. government gives to an industry that makes more money than any other industry, including refunds for drilling costs and refunds to cover the cost of searching for oil. Subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies. Just cutting the oil and gas subsidies out would save the U.S. government $45 billion every year." The last two sentences are the ones that stuck out to us. Given the wide range of subsidies the government grants, notably agricultural subsidies, do those for the oil and gas industry really account for 88 percent of the total? And do oil and gas subsidies really amount to $45 billion per year, which is equivalent to more than 2 percent of all federal revenues? We'll take them in order. "Subsidies for oil and gas companies make up 88 percent of all federal subsidies." We tracked down the Center for American Progress paper the statistic was drawn from -- "Pumping Tax Dollars to Big Oil: Getting Government Priorities Right on Tax Subsidies for Oil Companies," published on April 14, 2010, by Sima J. Gandhi, a senior economic policy analyst with the center. In the paper, Gandhi wrote, "Tax expenditures are government spending through the tax code. They are distributed through deductions, exclusions, credits, exemptions, preferential tax rates, and deferrals. What makes them look different from grants or checks is that they are delivered through the tax code as part of tax expenditure spending programs. These tax expenditures can amount to a significant portion of federal subsidies for oil and gas. The cost of tax expenditure programs for oil and gas companies made up about 88 percent of total federal subsidies in 2006." When we read that, it sounded to us like Gandhi was saying that 88 percent of all oil and gas subsidies were accomplished through the tax code -- not that 88 percent of all federal subsidies went to the oil and gas industry. To check that, we contacted Gandhi. She confirmed our suspicion and pointed us to her original source -- a 2006 paper published by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, a state office. The paper includes a detailed table and says that "various taxes represented approximately 87.4 percent of federal government subsidies for oil and gas in 2006." So it's clear to us that Olbermann misstated that statistic. "Cutting the oil and gas subsidies out would save the U.S. government $45 billion every year." This one proved even easier to check. We located a different Center for American Progress paper by Gandhi, "Eliminating Tax Subsidies for Oil Companies," published on May 13, 2010. In it, she outlines nine different types of subsidies (Olbermann was right about that number) and concludes that "the total government savings from eliminating these subsidies is projected to be $45 billion over 10 years." That's $45 billion over 10 years, not one year, as Olbermann had said. We aren't qualified to judge the accuracy of the Center for American Progress' statistics, which may well draw criticism from conservatives. But Olbermann clearly muffed it twice when he repeated them incorrectly to viewers -- and by a substantial margin -- giving viewers the impression that oil and gas subsidies are 10 times more expensive than they actually are. Because of this, we considered rating his comment Pants on Fire, but his errors seemed to us to be sloppy rather than devious. So we'll give him a rating of False. Postscript: On his show on July 9, 2010, Olbermann acknowledged the error: "One last note on the subject of oil. An apology and thank you, apologies to you for getting this wrong this past Tuesday. "We said the oil and gas industry gets 88 percent of all federal subsidies. Not true. A report by the Center for American Progress concluded that 88 percent of federal subsidies to oil and gas came in the form of tax breaks and credits and so forth. We all misread it. The buck stops here so I apologize for passing on the wrong info to you. "Cutting oil and gas subsidies would save $45 billion, but that's over 10 years, not in the one year we reported. So, our apologies again -- and our thanks to PolitiFact.com which brought this to light and guessed correctly that we misread the report, and our thanks to them for only rating our report "false" rather than their other option 'pants on fire.'"

pomt-14156	North Carolina has "one of the fastest growing populations as well as the fastest growing economy in the country."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/29/pat-mccrory/mccrory-north-carolina-has-had-countrys-fastest-gr/	Quarterly GDP numbers aren’t the sexiest item in political news, but when the latest state-level updates were released Thursday – for the third quarter of 2015, which ended Sept. 30 – Gov. Pat McCrory trumpeted them on both his official and campaign websites and social media pages. McCrory has dubbed his re-election campaign the "Carolina Comeback," trying to focus on good economic news. He said these numbers show North Carolina is squarely on the upswing. A state’s GDP, or gross domestic product, is the total of all goods and services it produces. And McCrory said that since he took office, no state has increased its gross domestic product faster than North Carolina. He credited the state’s cuts to the income tax rate and unemployment benefits, and the outsourcing of economic development efforts. He also clarified that he was talking about the numbers since January 2013. "We have delivered $4.4 billion in tax relief, fixed our broken unemployment insurance system and reformed our economic development strategy to strengthen North Carolina’s economy and put more people back to work," McCrory said in a statement. "These efforts have positioned North Carolina as one of the fastest growing populations as well as (the) fastest growing economy in the country." Economies are subject to a number of influences. For this fact check, we won’t attempt to say what has or hasn’t been responsible for the state’s economic growth. Instead, we will look just at whether it’s true that North Carolina has "one of the fastest growing populations as well as fastest growing economy in the country," as McCrory claimed. Population growth Between July 1, 2013 – shortly after McCrory took office – and July 1, 2015, North Carolina added about 194,000 people for a total population of 10,043,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That’s close to a 2 percent growth rate and slightly better than the national average over that period. From 2013 to 2014 and from 2014 to 2015, five states added more people than North Carolina. Both years, North Carolina was the ninth largest state. North Carolina isn’t adding people at the country’s fastest rate, or by the largest amounts. But it has a better-than-average growth rate, and it’s on pace to continue closing the gap with larger states. McCrory is correct that North Carolina has "one of the fastest growing populations." Economic growth This question is a little trickier. Has North Carolina had the fastest-growing economy in the country under Pat McCrory’s administration? There are many ways to measure economic strength, and North Carolina is not the best in every measure, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. For instance, in 2015, the state was 13th in total income and 39th in per-capita income. From 2013 to 2015 North Carolina also had the 19th-fastest growth in per-capita income and the 11th-fastest growth in total income. North Carolina’s unemployment and underemployment rates are also both above the national average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But McCrory specifically referenced GDP growth. For that reason, and because GDP is generally considered the most comprehensive measure of an economy’s strength, we’ll look only at GDP growth for the sake of this fact check. And on that, McCrory is right that North Carolina is No. 1. Between the first quarter of 2013 and the third quarter of 2015 (the most recent data we have), no state’s economic output grew as fast as North Carolina’s 13.4 percent rate. Florida and California came close, at 13.3 and 13.2 percent GDP growth, respectively. The average for both the Southeast and the United States as a whole was 9.9 percent. Because economists love to do math, there are other ways of defining the same data over the same period. That 13.4 percent rate specifically refers to current (non-inflation-adjusted) dollars. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis also measures GDP’s compound growth rate in current dollars and chained dollars. Chaining is a process that adjusts for inflation, but by using different methods from the more common Consumer Price Index. In that measure, North Carolina tied for first in current dollar amounts and tied for seventh in chained dollar amounts. It’s also worth noting that right now we’re partway through the second quarter of 2016, so the data are lagging behind real time by nearly six months. So while we don't know who currently has the fastest-growing economy, the data does show that North Carolina’s growth hasn’t been as dominant recently. Looking just from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, 2015 – the most recent numbers available – North Carolina’s GDP grew by 2.8 percent. That’s lower than 10 other states and tied with another seven. It’s good, but not the best. Our ruling McCrory is right that North Carolina has "one of the fastest growing populations." As for the economy, North Carolina did have the fastest-growing GDP in the country between the first quarter of 2013, when McCrory took office, and the third quarter of 2015. The pace has slowed recently, but that doesn't change the truth of the statement. We rate this claim True.	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-04-29T18:26:05	2016-04-28	['None']

pomt-13579	"Medical-grade marijuana alone will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/aug/19/united-care/medical-grade-marijuana-wont-get-you-high-cannabis/	Medical marijuana has many uses, according to supporters of Florida’s Amendment 2, but getting high is not one of them. Kim McCray, outreach director for United for Care, said in an Aug. 11 South Florida Times op-ed that the well-known euphoric effects of cannabis aren’t an issue. "What is also important to know is that although some debilitated patients may require higher levels of THC than others based on their specific medical condition, medical-grade marijuana alone, will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant," McCray wrote. She pointed out that medical cannabis can not only be smoked, but be packaged as ointments, oils, pills and skin patches. It sounded peculiar to us to say that medical marijuana can’t get you high, regardless of the chemical content. We checked with some experts to clear the air. Doctor’s orders Florida voters will decide in November 2016 whether to allow medical marijuana in the state. The proposed constitutional amendment would allow patients with cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis "or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated" to obtain cannabis with a doctor’s recommendation. What the system would truly look like is still anyone’s guess, because the amendment leaves most of the details up to the state Legislature and state health department. Patients would get a state-registered ID card that would allow them to get their marijuana, but the how, when and where of it wouldn’t be decided until the amendment passes. Also unknown is just what kind of "medical-grade marijuana" will be available. Amendment 2 doesn’t place restrictions on what forms of cannabis the state could allow, including cannabis in its smokable form. To understand the types of marijuana or marijuana products we’re talking about, we need a quick chemistry lesson. Cannabis contains roughly 500 compounds, 70 of which are psychoactive. THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is the main psychoactive ingredient in the marijuana plant. The level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain, the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption. Also present is a substance called cannabidiol, known as CBD, which is an antioxidant and has properties that are thought to protect the brain. It’s also not psychoactive like THC. Florida’s 2014 law approved low-THC cannabis oil or vapor products containing CBD for patients with muscle spasms, cancer, epilepsy and terminal illnesses. Fifteen other states have similar laws. Even the National Institute on Drug Abuse says CBD may prove useful in treating epilepsy as well as inflammation and mental illnesses or addictions. Products like cannabis oil are made from strains of marijuana already bred to be high in CBD and low in THC, although THC still is a part of the equation. Research shows that compound is what brings CBD into the brain. Now for how this applies to McCray’s statement. United for Care spokeswoman Bianca Garza said McCray meant to dispel the notion that medical marijuana patients obtain their medicine for the sole purpose of feeling its well-known euphoric effects. "The point being made in the statement is that doctors and patients will decide on a care plan that will enable them to become more normal," Garza said in an email. "In other words, they'll decide on a dosage appropriate for their debilitating condition to feel less pain, to have fewer seizures and spasms, etc. It will be decided by a Florida licensed physician and will not lead to patients being ‘high.’ " Essentially, their argument is one of semantics: Medical marijuana patients won’t be getting stoned, they’ll be using medication under the supervision of a doctor as a form of treatment. That precludes the idea that patients will just be taking marijuana as a recreational drug, although Garza conceded that "like any medicine, there’s the possibility for abuse." United for Care’s point of view still doesn’t mean some forms of medical marijuana aren’t capable of getting patients baked. Marijuana still has physiological effects, whether it’s doctor-approved or not. Dr. David Casarett, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and author of the book Stoned: A Doctor's Case for Medical Marijuana, said that low-THC strains or oils that have only CBD don’t produce the same buzzed feeling as a joint. But higher-THC marijuana still "will most certainly get you high," he said. "Just calling something ‘medical grade’ won't prevent you from getting high," Casarett said. "It's like alcohol. Laboratory grade ethanol will get you just as drunk as home-brewed moonshine with the same alcohol content." Our ruling A representative of United for Care said, "Medical-grade marijuana alone will not get that patient ‘high,’ no matter what level of THC, CBD or any other compound is found in the plant." The group said McKay is referring to the controlled conditions under which medical marijuana would be monitored by doctors for use by patients. But her word choice could easily lead to misunderstanding. While there are non-euphoric strains of cannabis that are already being used as treatments for some conditions, it’s not accurate to say that no form of medical marijuana will get you high. High-THC medical cannabis will still produce the same intoxicating effects as the street form of the drug will.

pomt-13640	Says Rep. Mike Coffman is "the one who said" he would support Trump.	mostly false	/colorado/statements/2016/aug/09/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-ads-says-rep-coffman-said-youd-support-trump-/	Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman made international headlines with an ad sharply criticizing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump — a first for a House GOP lawmaker. "People ask me, 'What do you think about Trump?’ Honestly, I don't care for him much," Coffman said in the online ad released Aug. 4, 2016. "So, if Donald Trump is president, I'll stand up to him, plain and simple. And if Hillary wins, I'll hold her accountable every step of the way." Coffman, who is fighting for re-election in a suburban Denver district that is one of the state’s most competitive and ethnically diverse, spoke Spanish in one version of his anti-Trump ad. Democratic groups, and some political reporters, were skeptical about whether Coffman’s stand was courageous or politically calculated. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee quickly issued a counter ad. It shows Coffman vowing, "So if Donald Trump is the president, I’ll stand up to him." Then a narrator says, "Wait, you’re the one who said you’d support him. Don’t let Mike Coffman get away with this gimmick." It ends with side-by-side photos of Coffman and Trump and the text: "SAY NO to Mike Coffman AND Donald Trump." It’s been a constant battle this election season as Democrats seek to shackle Republican candidates to their party’s controversial presidential candidate. The DCCC ad cites a six-month-old statement that Coffman’s spokeswoman gave to the Colorado Statesman as evidence Coffman would "support" Trump. But the statement, from Kristin Strohm, also clearly said Coffman supported former GOP presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, whom Coffman endorsed in late 2015. "Will Mike Coffman support the Republican nominee over Bernie or Hillary?" Strohm said in the Feb. 2 story. "The answer is obviously yes. And he believes strongly it is going to be Marco Rubio." At the time, Trump was one of 11 Republicans still in the race. The DCCC attack echoes a May claim by an immigration reform group that cited the Colorado Statesman quote along with criticism of Coffman’s record on immigration as evidence that the congressman was "with Trump." PolitiFact rated that claim Mostly False. At the time, Coffman political director JD Key suggested to PolitiFact that Coffman might be having second thoughts about automatically supporting the GOP nominee. "Rep. Coffman has not endorsed or voiced support for Donald Trump," Key said. In fact, Coffman has said for three months — before and after the billionaire became the GOP nominee — that Trump hasn’t earned his support. "Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have tapped into a legitimate anger about the failures of Washington, but instead of running a campaign built on a positive vision for overcoming these failures, Donald Trump has conducted a polarizing and divisive campaign," Coffman said in a May 4 statement. "Hillary Clinton is a non-starter and lacks the integrity to lead this nation but Trump has a long way to go to earn the support of many — me included." Coffman’s problem with Trump flared when Trump falsely blasted the Colorado GOP’s caucus system as "rigged," after Ted Cruz won all 34 delegates on April 9. Coffman, a Marine Corps combat veteran, fired back with this April 18 Facebook post: "If there is anyone who knows what a rigged system looks like it’s Donald Trump who was able to evade the draft during the height of the Vietnam War when the U.S. was losing, on average, 1,000 troops every month. That system was clearly rigged in favor of young men from politically influential families but Donald Trump never complained about that." Coffman also went after Trump in June when Trump aggressively defended his claims that a judge overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University is biased because of his Mexican heritage in an interview on CNN. Coffman tweeted June 3: "Donald Trump has said plenty of outrageous, ridiculous things this year. And still, I literally can’t believe the words that came out of his mouth here. Donald Trump should call Jake Tapper, sit in front of a camera that’s recording, and retract this completely and totally unAmerican slur." Coffman didn’t attend the Republican National Convention in Ohio. Following Trump’s acceptance speech, Coffman told the Denver Post it hadn’t changed his view of the GOP nominee, saying "I don’t like him much." Then came Trump’s hostile response to the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq. The soldier’s father had criticized Trump’s proposal to ban Muslim immigration, saying the Republican nominee had "sacrificed nothing and no one," during a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Coffman told the New York Times that Trump had disrespected American troops. "Having served in Iraq, I’m deeply offended when Donald Trump fails to honor the sacrifices of all of our brave soldiers who were lost in that war," Coffman said. Soon afterward, Coffman released his anti-Trump ad. Again, Coffman told PolitiFact’s partner Denver7, "Donald Trump has not earned my support," on the day the ad aired. "What does it take for Donald Trump to get your vote?" Denver7 reporter Marshall Zelinger asked. "He has not earned my vote," Coffman said. "I'm going to wait and watch, but the window's closing. (Trump's) wrong on policy, wrong on rhetoric. I think Hillary Clinton is wrong on everything. I think she's so incredibly dishonest and corrupt, but again, Donald Trump has not earned my vote." Coffman said he would not rule out voting for the Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and vice presidential nominee Bill Weld. Yet, when KUSA asked Coffman, "Would you rule out supporting Donald Trump for president?" he said, "No." The fence-straddling reply drew a website headline: "Coffman (kind of) comes out against Trump." The DCCC defends the accuracy of its ad claim — "you’re the one who said you’d support (Trump) — based on the February statement by Coffman’s spokeswoman that he would "obviously" support the eventual GOP nominee. It doesn’t matter how many times Coffman says "Trump has not earned my support," DCCC says, arguing that his position hasn’t changed if he leaves the door open to backing him. "He's trying to have it both ways," the DCCC said. Our ruling The DCCC said of Coffman, "You’re the one who said you’d support (Trump)," in response to Coffman’s ad saying he would stand up to Trump. The DCCC’s evidence is based on a six-month-old statement during the primary by his campaign spokeswoman. The spokeswoman said Coffman would "support the Republican nominee," stressing Coffman wanted Rubio out of the remaining 11 candidates. Since then, Coffman has become the only Republican House lawmaker to issue an ad criticizing his party’s presidential nominee. He has condemned Trump’s treatment of a Gold Star family and demanded that he retract his "totally unAmerican slur" of a Mexican-American judge. Most importantly, Coffman himself has repeatedly said the billionaire has a long way to go to earn his support. The DCCC ad skirts key facts. Coffman has never embraced Trump’s candidacy — even saying "I don’t like him much" — and he’s gone farther than most Republicans in rebuking his "polarizing and divisive campaign."

pomt-14944	"Sixty-one percent of our bridges are in trouble."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/26/donald-trump/trump-says-61-percent-us-bridges-trouble/	Donald Trump wants to build bridges, although not necessarily the political kind. "We’re like a Third World country," he said during a Oct. 14 rally in Henrico County. "Our airports, our roads, our bridges are falling down. Sixty-one percent of our bridges are in trouble. Do you believe this? We drive over a bridge, it’s in trouble." We wondered whether the eye-popping 61 percent figure is true. Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to our request for the source of the statistic, so we did some digging. The Federal Highway Administration publishes annual data on deficient bridges in state and federal highway systems. The most recent report, based on December 2014 findings, found that 61,365 bridges are "structurally deficient." That breaks down to about 10 percent of the nation’s 610,749 bridges. The FHWA website says "a `structurally deficient’ designation does not imply that a bridge is unsafe, but such bridges typically require significant maintenance and repair to remain in service, and would eventually require major rehabilitation or replacement to address the underlying deficiency." These often are rural bridges, according to the agency. The FHWA lists another 84,525 bridges -- or almost 14 percent -- as "functionally obsolete." These are mostly urban spans that the agency says don’t "meet current design standards (for criteria such as lane width), either because the volume of traffic carried by the bridge exceeds the level anticipated when the bridge was constructed and/or the relevant design standards have been revised." All told, 145,890 U.S. bridges have been identified as deficient. That comes to 24 percent of the nation’s spans. We should note that the Henrico rally wasn’t the first time Trump has used the bridge statistic. During an Aug. 25 news conference in Iowa, he said "59 percent of our bridges are in trouble." FactCheck.org published an article two days later saying the claim was inaccurate. Finally, if you’re wondering, Virginia has 13,800 bridges and the highway administration characterizes 3,574 of them as deficient. That’s 26 percent. Of those spans, 1,120 -- or 8 percent -- are structurally deficient. Another 2,454 bridges -- or 18 percent -- are functionally obsolete. Our ruling Trump says "61 percent of our bridges are in trouble." The FHWA identifies 24 percent of the bridges as deficient. This doesn’t mean, to borrow a Trump phrase, that "our bridges are falling down." It means that the infrastructure is aging and many of the spans require high maintenance, while others are serving more traffic than anticipated when they were built. We don’t mean to minimize the nation’s infrastructure problems, but Trump’s inflated figure is nowhere near the mark. We rate his statement False.

pomt-00624	Georgia ranks 49th for women serving in elected state and federal offices.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/27/institute-womens-policy-research/report-georgia-49-women-state-federal-elected-offi/	In 2015, most major political officeholders in the U.S. -- including about 80 percent of the members of Congress and about 75 percent of the nation’s state lawmakers -- are men, a new report from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research shows. The institute ranks Georgia 49th among the 50 states for women serving in elected state and federal offices in 2015, citing its all-male congressional delegation, its 77 percent-male state Legislature and its lack of any women in statewide elected office. PolitiFact Georgia decided to look closer at the numbers. The Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a Washington-based nonprofit, tracks issues considered pertinent to women’s lives, including political participation, employment and earnings, work and family, poverty and opportunity, reproductive rights, health and well-being, and violence and safety. On the political front, the group follows several trends, including women serving in elected office. The new report shows upticks nationally between 2004 and 2015 in both the number and share of women serving in state legislatures, the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, but declines in the number and share of women holding statewide elective office. Nationally, as of March, women held 104 of 535 (19.4 percent) seats in the U.S. Congress, 1,786 of 7,383 (24.2 percent) seats in state legislatures and 78 of 317 (24.6 percent) statewide elective executive offices, the report states. In Georgia, 54 women are serving in the 236-member state Legislature this year, the researchers reported. But they found the state had no women in the U.S. House, U.S. Senate or in statewide elected office. Only Louisiana rated lower than Georgia, with women making up 10.3 percent of its state Senate and 13.3 percent of the state House but holding no seats in Congress and no statewide offices. New Hampshire is No. 1 for 2015, up from 42nd place in 2004, with three of its four congressional seats held by women. The state has a female governor, and women fill about one-third of the state’s House and Senate seats, according to the institute. We checked the institute’s data against information on female legislators available at the website of the National Council of State Legislatures. The NCSL reported 1,782 female legislators, nationally, and 53 in Georgia, numbers just slightly different, as of February, from the institute’s totals. The NCSL pointed out that the data were subject to change due to resignations, appointments and special elections. The National Women’s Political Caucus reported the number of women serving in state legislatures in 2013 was 1,779, essentially what it is today. The institute’s report notes that women haven’t made the gains in elected offices in recent years that they did in the past couple of decades. It points out that, in the six years from 2009 to 2015, the female members of Congress grew only minimally, from 16.8 percent to 19.4 percent. There are various theories on why more women aren’t officeholders. Some research suggests that women generally win elected office at similar rates as men but fewer women run for office. Veteran state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, said politics is frequently a rough business and one where "men assume they are qualified and ready to be elected or appointed, women are more hesitant to take the leap." But when they are willing to serve and willing to compete for opportunities to lead, as well as just to be there, women can do really well, Oliver said. "They can be a moderating influence. They are more collaborative and they can be better at identifying a variety of issues that affect real people, and that’s true of both Democratic and Republican women," she said. State Rep. Debbie Buckner, a Democrat from Junction City, said she believes the House lost more than the normal number of female lawmakers after redistricting. "Maybe it is ‘Southern’ manners or disdain for conflict, but there were some who chose not to run against their colleagues," said Buckner, who was first elected to the House in 2002. She said it is difficult for a woman to serve in the Legislature when it means juggling family, job, campaigning, fundraising, constituent concerns and legislative duties that include preparing for committee meetings and floor debates. "My first year of service my daughter was only six," Buckner said. "I was asked repeatedly: ‘Don't you worry about her? How can you leave her? Or how do how do you do this with such a young child at home?’ … I have often wondered how many male legislators were asked any of those questions." Buckner said she believes "intelligent and thoughtful women add much to the process." "Their perspective is more broad and encompassing and many times more collaborative," she said. Our conclusion: A new report from the Institute for Women’s Policy Research says Georgia is 49th among the 50 states for women serving in elected state and federal offices. It cites the state’s all-male congressional delegation, its 77 percent-male Legislature and its lack of any women in statewide elected office. Other sources report similar data.

The Nazis were known for keeping their plans secret, and while Hitler spurred the majority of the anti-Semitic rhetoric in Nazi Germany, there are no records expressly describing deportations in the 1930s as a military operation.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Information from Trinity College&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s Professor Evelein and the Hamburg Institute for Social Research revealed the German army did have a hand in carrying out the deportation of Jews.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Finally, as Evelein pointed out, there are many differences between Trump&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s deportation plan and the plan Hitler carried out, including the criteria for deportation and in the case of European Jews, torture and execution.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Reilly&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s statement contains an element of truth but ignores many important facts.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Overall, we rate this claim Mostly False.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; It’s not uncommon for politicians to compare their opponents to Adolf Hitler or his policies. This comparison differs from most, though. Reilly refers to an actual statement from Hitler that deportations in the 1930s were part of a "military operation." For this fact-check, we looked back at the policies of Germany’s Third Reich, and specifically whether Hitler or his inner circle had publicly characterized forced deportations in the 1930s as a military operation. Nazi Germany’s anti-Semitic policies To begin, we reached out to Reilly’s office to see where the alderman found the source he used for the tweet. A staffer told us on background that it’s a well-known fact that soldiers aided with the deportation of Jews and that the military, known as the Wehrmacht, guarded concentration camps. The staffer said the information came from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) website. We turned to the museum in order to see whether Hitler actually called the deportation of Jews a "military operation." Anti-Semitism grew in the early-to-mid-1930s as the Nazi Party became more powerful. With the help of the Gestapo, the Sutrmabteilungen (Stormtroopers) and the Schutzstaffel (more commonly known as the SS), Hitler’s Germany restricted Jews from having many basic human rights. According to the museum, for six years, Nazi-inspired legislation restricted Jews from entering certain parts of town and stripped them of any meaningful employment. In 1939, many German Jews were being deported to concentration camps. According to the museum website, the deportations were spurred through the Nisko, or Lublin plan, which were Jewish "reservations" in what was then a German-occupied area of Poland. Adolf Eichmann of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) coordinated the transfer of roughly 3,500 Jews through the Lublin plan. There were other instances of deportations in the 1930s. The USHMM website notes Germans also were deported three days after the official start of WWII if they spoke out against the war. This was enacted by Reinhard Heydrich, commander of the Security Service. However, there is no record on the USHMM website of Hitler publicly announcing his intentions for deportations or of him describing them as military operations. While Hitler often spoke about his goals regarding racial purity, he never actually tied them to his military pursuits, publicly or otherwise. According to the USHMM, it still is unknown when exactly, during 1941, Hitler officially authorized the Final Solution, the name given to the Nazi Plan to exterminate the Jews. In fact, there still is no trace of a written order from Hitler ordering the deportation of Jews. This kind of internal secrecy was common in Nazi Germany. The website Holocaust Denial on Trial, a joint project of Emory University and Emory’s Tam Institute for Jewish Studies, cites Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, as saying, "We will never speak of it publicly … I mean the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish race…This is a page of glory in our history which has never been written and is never to be written." Evidence of Hitler publicly connecting his military plans to the deportation is lacking, though Reilly’s tweet indicates otherwise. The Trump comparison In the CNN story Reilly retweeted, Trump called his deportation plan a military operation. When asked to clarify, the White House told CNN the president meant "military" as an adjective. But Reilly’s conflation of German deportations in the 1930s and Trump’s plan is an inaccurate premise on its face, said Johannes Evelein, a professor of language and cultural studies at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. Reilly’s comparison of Hitler’s deportation raises more differences than similarities, Evelein said. "What we are seeing with Trump’s plan is the deportation of immigrants who came here illegally and being returned back to their original country," Evelein said. "In Hitler’s Germany, actual German citizens were being deported. Trump’s plan is more of a question of who is illegal and who’s not, rather than Hitler’s plan, which gauged which citizens were pure and which ones weren’t." Evelein says as a general rule he hesitates to compare any figure to Hitler. "I have seen a lot of these comparisons and I understand where they are coming from, but I tend to stay away from the comparison," Evelein said. "I feel others should, too, unless people have the time to develop the point and zero in on a very specific element. It’s very easy to write a tweet and be done." He even considers these kinds of comparisons "dangerous," especially when done in a short format like Twitter. "There are limits to how much you can explain yourself," Evelein said. "Given the limited amount of text (on Twitter), it invites a kind of glibness. Oftentimes, it’s provocative. Politically, it seems unwise to do that precisely because you cannot explain yourself." Our ruling A recent tweet from Chicago Ald. Brendan Reilly compared a quote from President Trump to the military aspirations of Adolf Hitler. Trump was quoted as saying his deportation plan is a military operation. Reilly responded in a tweet saying, "I seem to recall a guy in mid-1930s Germany who said the same thing." After reviewing sources from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Holocaust Denial on Trial website, we could not find any record of Hitler expressly calling his deportation of Jews a military operation. The Nazis were known for keeping their plans secret, and while Hitler spurred the majority of the anti-Semitic rhetoric in Nazi Germany, there are no records expressly describing deportations in the 1930s as a military operation. Information from Trinity College’s Professor Evelein and the Hamburg Institute for Social Research revealed the German army did have a hand in carrying out the deportation of Jews. Finally, as Evelein pointed out, there are many differences between Trump’s deportation plan and the plan Hitler carried out, including the criteria for deportation and in the case of European Jews, torture and execution. Reilly’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores many important facts. Overall, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13437	"Within just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/19/donald-trump/trump-says-few-years-immigrant-share-population-wi/	Donald Trump has made immigration a focal point of his presidential campaign, proposing to build a wall to curb illegal immigration, to reinstate and expand deportation programs, and to put in place ideological certifications for those who want to come to the United States. In an immigration speech in Arizona, Trump also said he wanted restrictions on future immigration. He said many of the millions of immigrants admitted into the United States "have greatly enriched our country," but there is now "an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration." "Within just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records," Trump said Aug. 31. That got us wondering: Will the share of foreign-born population soon set new highs? We’ll start with a few points to keep in mind about what Trump said: • "Within just a few years" is a bit vague and can be relative. But by definition, few is a small number. • "Immigration as a share of national population" does not distinguish between illegal immigration, his campaign cornerstone, or legal immigration. So our check will include all foreign-born immigrants, living here legally and illegally. • "Break all historical records" dates back to 1890, the year to beat. That’s the year when 14.77 percent of the country’s nearly 63 million population was foreign born. Trump’s campaign sent us a September 2015 USA Today article that said a new record would be set in 2025 as the share of the foreign-born population reaches 14.9 percent. The article is based on a report from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, noting a "rapid growth" of the foreign-born share from 4.7 percent in 1970 to 13.1 percent in 2013, and "approaching a historic high." "With our data, we could approximate that it would be some time in 2024 or 2025," Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with Pew Research Center, told PolitiFact. "But our projections definitely support the idea of 2025 exceeding the historic high." And that’s assuming that immigration between 2020-25 will exceed current pace by about 20 percent to 25 percent, Passel said. "At current levels of immigration, reaching the high would take a few additional years," he said. Census projections The Census Bureau didn’t start asking people where they were born until 1850. From 1850 to 1930, large-scale immigration from Europe contributed to an increase of the foreign-born population in the United States. Now, the majority of the foreign-born population is from Latin America and Asia, according to the bureau. A "native-born" resident refers to anyone who is a U.S. citizen at birth, including people born in territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam, as well as people born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent. In March 2015 the bureau released projections on the size and composition of the U.S. population. They are based on assumptions about future births, deaths and net international migration. By 2020, 14.3 percent of a total 334.5 million people will be foreign-born, the bureau forecasts. That’s close to the 1890 record of 14.77 percent. The Census Bureau estimated increases per decade up to 2060, when 18.8 percent of the 416.8 million population is expected to be foreign-born. But more detailed, year-by-year census data is also available based on 2014 projections (table 2). By 2023, 14.79 percent of the population is forecast to be foreign-born -- that’s below the 14.8 percent usually rounded and referenced by Census as the record, but slightly above the actual 1890 figure, 14.77. By 2024, the foreign-born share is projected to be 14.94, definitely surpassing the record, per Census estimates. By 2025, the estimated share is 15.09 percent. By these yearly measures, Trump’s statement is correct, said Steven Camarota, director of research for Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring strict immigration policies. "The key thing is that the population is not stable, it keeps going up, unless there is a policy change," said Camarota, who co-wrote a report on the Census projections. Our ruling Trump said, "Within just a few years, immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records." Historic data and projections suggest the foreign-born population is rising. A new record could be reached in about seven years, according to Census Bureau estimates. Experts also say projections are based assuming future immigration exceeds current pace. At current levels, it may take longer. Trump didn’t specify in how many years the record would be broken, but data points to a probable new record in fewer than 10 years. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13252	"Marco Rubio made it clear: Not only does he think Donald Trump is a con man, he went on to say he doesn't trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes."	true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/18/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-right-about-marco-rubio-attacks-don/	Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy questioned how Republican Sen. Marco Rubio could stand by Donald Trump at the first U.S. Senate debate, especially since Rubio attacked Trump throughout the Republican presidential primary. "My opponent, Marco Rubio, made it clear: Not only does he think Donald Trump is a con man, he went on to say he doesn't trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes," Murphy said in Orlando on Oct. 17. Murphy is right — Rubio has not held back in his words against Trump. On multiple occasions, Rubio referred to Trump as a con man or con artist and said he doesn’t trust Trump with the nuclear codes. Rubio did not deny the comments in his response, saying, "I don’t trust either one of them. And the job of a U.S. senator is not to blindly trust a president because they happen to be from your own party." He added later: "I stand by everything I ever said in the Republican primary. And I would admit right off the bat this is not the most inspirational choice we’ve ever had in American history in terms of these two candidates." The problem, Rubio said, is Democrat Hillary Clinton is even less trustworthy with sensitive information than Trump. So the candidates agree that Rubio trashed Trump but backs the nominee anyway. We ran down the quotes in question. Rubio dubbed Trump a con on multiple occasions when he was vying for the Republican nomination. Most of the name-calling happened after a Feb. 25 GOP primary debate, as Rubio made the morning TV news rounds and attended rallies. Rubio called Trump a con man four times in 15 seconds at a rally in Oklahoma City on Feb. 26. "I will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of Reagan and the conservative movement," Rubio said of Trump. "He’s a con man. He's a con man. He’s a con man. I'll tell you why." Rubio, who was critical of Trump’s business background, accused Trump of "taking advantage" of voters’ economic anxiety. Then there were Rubio’s appearances on ABC's Good Morning America, NBC’s Today show and CBS’ This Morning, all on Feb. 26. "A con artist is about to take over the Republican Party and the conservative movement, and we have to put a stop to it," Rubio said on CBS. In that same interview, Rubio said he doesn’t trust giving an "erratic individual" like Trump the nuclear codes. "This is the most important government job on the planet, and we're about to turn over the conservative movement to a person that has no ideas of any substance on the important issues — the nuclear codes of the United States — to an erratic individual — and the conservative movement — to someone who has spent a career sticking it to working people," Rubio said. Our ruling Murphy said Rubio "made it clear, not only does he think Donald Trump is a con man, he went on to say he doesn't trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes." Transcripts and Rubio himself confirm this claim. Rubio even told Monday’s debate crowd he still doesn’t trust Trump with the nuclear codes — he just distrusts Clinton more.

pomt-01568	"Over the next two years, this $1.8 billion deficit will cost individual Wisconsinites $300 each, or $1,200 for families of four."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/11/chris-larson/projected-state-budget-shortfall-will-cost-wiscons/	On the day a Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau report made headlines that said the state faces a "shortfall" estimated at nearly $1.8 billion for its 2015-’17 budget, state Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson put a personal price tag on the news. "Over the next two years," the Milwaukee Democrat said in a Sept. 8, 2014 news release, "this $1.8 billion deficit will cost individual Wisconsinites $300 each, or $1,200 for families of four." Can a mere estimate trigger hard costs to taxpayers? The backdrop We rated Half True a related claim by state Sen. Alberta Darling, a suburban Milwaukee Republican, that the state not only has no deficit but rather a $443 million surplus. Currently, the 20113-’15 state budget has that surplus, but by the end of the fiscal year, in June 2015, that’s projected by the bureau to turn into a $396 million shortfall. Here’s what we know from that earlier factcheck about the nonpartisan fiscal bureau’s $1.8 billion shortfall estimate for 2015-'17: 1. The projected $1.8 billion shortfall is an educated guess about future tax collections and demands for services. Shortfalls occur in large part because of changes in how much money comes in through income and sales tax collections, which are dependent on the economy, among other factors. 2. Again, the projection is not for the current budget cycle, but rather for the 2015-’17 biennium. A budget for 2015-’17 is for the winner of the Nov. 4, 2014 gubernatorial election between Gov. Scott Walker and Democrat Mary Burke to propose and for the new Legislature to adopt during the first half of 2015. The $1.8 billion projected assumes no changes in revenue and no changes in spending -- in other words, continuing the operations of state government as they are now. The figure could turn out to be smaller or larger, depending on how tax collections and spending vary. Moreover, there’s no way to know how state officials will deal with any shortfall. It will be up to the next governor and the Legislature to decide whether tax increases or spending cuts are necessary. When Walker took office in January 2011, he faced a $2.5 billion shortfall, plus an increase of roughly $1.1 billion in funding requests from state agencies. That amounted to a $3.6 billion "deficit," which Walker addressed through funding cuts and the Act 10 collective bargaining law. Later tax cuts have contributed to the projected 2015-'17 shortfall, which is sometimes referred to as the state’s "structural deficit." Larson’s evidence We asked Larson’s staff for evidence that the estimated shortfall will cost individuals $300 and families of four $1,200 over the next two years. A spokesman said the office simply divided the projected shortfall -- $1.766 billion -- by Wisconsin’s population -- 5,742,712, as of a 2013 U.S. census estimate. The result was $307 per person. And multiplying that by four, the figure was $1,230. But breaking down the size of the projected deficit to a per-person level in no way means individuals or families will have to pay those amounts. In fact, Larson spokesman Fred Ludwig told us Larson was referring to "cost" in a broad sense -- that a $1.8 billion shortfall would mean people would experience either tax increases or cuts in services. But as we’ve noted, the $1.8 billion estimate could change and there’s no way to know how state officials will respond to such a shortfall. Had a claim similar to Larson’s been made at the same stage four years ago, it would have also been wrong. One measure of how shortfalls can be addressed: Walker tackled the deficit in his first budget with big spending cuts and other changes, some of which saved taxpayers money. Our rating Larson said: "Over the next two years, this $1.8 billion deficit will cost individual Wisconsinites $300 each, or $1,200 for families of four." No decisions will be made until well after the November 2014 elections on whether to raise revenue or cut spending in order to close the $1.8 billion gap, which is an estimate for the 2015-’17 state budget cycle. And it’s possible that, based on tax collections, the $1.8 billion figure could change. We rate Larson’s statement False.	None	Chris Larson	None	None	None	2014-09-11T11:51:50	2014-09-08	['None']

pomt-06247	"Eighty-five percent . . . of Rhode Island tax returns that were filed for the year 2010 . . . were from individuals who earned $30,000 or less."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/01/lisa-baldelli-hunt/ri-rep-lisa-baldelli-hunt-says-tax-return-data-sho/	One of the unsuccessful amendments proposed during the General Assembly's debate on changing the pension system for state workers called for calculating pension benefits using the average pay over the last 10 years of employment, not the last three or five years. The sponsor, Rep. Lisa Baldelli-Hunt, a Woonsocket Democrat, said the measure would prevent last-minute raises from bumping up a person's pension benefits. Taxpayers, she said, can't afford such largess. "I'm going to give you a little fact that I was given by the general treasurer, which was pretty astonishing, and that is that 85 percent . . . of Rhode Island tax returns that were filed for the year 2010 . . . were from individuals who earned $30,000 or less. Only 15 percent of Rhode Islanders filed tax returns and earned more than $30,000," she said during the debate on the House floor. That's a lot of people making a very modest income -- in fact, in Baldelli-Hunt’s words, it's a "pretty astonishing" number. It was astonishing -- and worthy of more careful checking than Baldelli-Hunt undertook. It turns out Baldelli-Hunt was never directly told that 85 percent of Rhode Islanders make $30,000 or less. She said she calculated that percentage based on what she was told during an Oct. 31 meeting with General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and two members of her staff. As Baldelli-Hunt recalled the meeting, Raimondo said well over 400,000 tax returns filed for the 2010 tax year reported incomes of $30,000 or less. The state representative said Raimondo's number was either 468,000 or 486,000. (She would use the lower, more conservative, number in her calculation.) Baldelli-Hunt said a financial consultant who was with her at the meeting also recalls a number of over 400,000 and "we nearly fell off our seats when we heard that, and that put in perspective how Rhode Islanders are struggling." On Nov. 17, when the pension proposal was being debated, Baldelli-Hunt took that number and divided it by 554,870, a number her financial consultant pulled off the Internet that was supposed to represent the number of 2010 tax returns filed with the state. The calculation gives you 84.3 percent. That’s how she arrived at her 85-percent figure. First of all, 554,870 is not the number of 2010 tax returns. It’s actually the number of 2009 returns filed by early June of 2010. Also, it includes the returns of people who don’t live in Rhode Island. When we called Raimondo's office and also Paul Dion, chief of the state's Office of Revenue Analysis, they referred us to the final report on resident income tax returns for the tax year 2009. Both said it was the most recent data that breaks down the returns by income category. That report paints a very different picture. It says the state received 483,392 returns from Rhode Island residents that year, with 230,289 reporting incomes of less than $30,000. That's 48 percent, not 85 percent. We were curious whether it made a difference to include the tax returns of non-residents, including people who live out of the state but who file here because they work here. Of the 91,231 non-residents who filed in 2009, 27,818 earned under $30,000. Folding those number into the mix brought the percentage down to 45 percent. Baldelli-Hunt said she is sure of what she heard from the treasurer. Perhaps, she speculated, when Raimondo was looking at the number of returns reporting income of less than $30,000, her eye mistakenly jumped one column to the left, to the 483,392 number, which is the total number of returns. The correct percentage -- 48 percent -- still means that "half of working people in the state make $30,000 or less," she said. "It's almost shocking." Raimondo spokesman Joy Fox, who was not at the meeting, said the treasurer always uses the 2009 statistics and no one can recall giving Baldelli-Hunt different information. Our ruling We can't say whether Baldelli-Hunt is accurately recalling something she heard from Raimondo. There is no audio recording of the meeting. We can only rule on the accuracy of Baldelli-Hunt's statement when she said that 85 percent of Rhode Island tax returns, filed for the 2010 tax year, reported income of $30,000 or less. The most-recent income data, from 2009, show that the ratio is 48 percent, far less than what she stated. (The state isn't scheduled to release an income breakdown of its 2010 returns until sometime around March 2012.) That 48 percent turns out to be fairly typical. State reports from 2005-2008 show that the percentage doesn't change much year to year, so it seems extraordinarily unlikely that even when the 2010 tax return numbers come out, the percentage will jump to anything close to 85 percent. Carl Sagan, the late astronomer, liked to say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. We agree. Baldelli-Hunt described the statistic was "pretty astonishing." It would have served her well to double-check it before using it during debate on the biggest issue to come before the General Assembly this year. Her assertion that 85 percent of tax returns report income of $30,000 or less -- based on a hasty calculation -- is not only false but ridiculous, we rule her statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08675	"He's the only candidate who's balanced budgets and brought jobs to Providence."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/11/steven-costantino/costantino-says-hes-the-only-mayoral-candidate/	In the four-way Democratic primary for Providence mayor, state Rep. Steven Costantino has portrayed what some consider a liability -- his years in the General Assembly -- as a strength that separates him from the rest of the pack. His latest TV commercials cite his experience, saying "he’s the only candidate who’s balanced budgets and brought jobs to Providence." We’ll take the claims one at a time, starting with the budget balancing. As chairman of the House Finance Committee, a position he’s held for seven years, Costantino is considered the legislature’s chief budget writer. The Rhode Island Constitution requires state budgets to be balanced. And on paper, when the governor presents his budget to the General Assembly and when the Assembly gives final approval to its revised version, they are. But critics have long complained that Rhode Island's budgets are never really balanced. Too often, they're predicated on spending plans that aren't followed, or on overly optimistic assumptions that federal funding will increase or gambling revenues will grow. Almost every year, the Assembly must pass mid-year "supplemental" budgets to plug the holes. Then the debate continues as to whether they were ever balanced in the first place. Costantino defends the budgets he’s crafted as House Finance chairman, saying they are accurate at the time they are written. "Every budget in the world is an assumption," he said. "At the time we pass them, they are balanced." Yet the finance chairman is also realistic that tax-and-spend plans don’t tend to stay that way for long. They are moving targets. Technically, he’s right about all of that. But is Costantino the only candidate who has experience balancing budgets? Three of his opponents-- Democrats Angel Taveras and Christopher Young and independent Jonathan Scott -- have never held elected office, so none of them has been in a position to balance a budget. Democrat John Lombardi is another story. For 26 years, Lombardi has served on the City Council, including seven years as president. He also filled in briefly as mayor after Vincent A "Buddy" Cianci resigned in 2002. We asked Lombardi about his experience with the city’s budget, which, like the state’s plan, must be balanced each year. As council president, Lombardi said he oversaw the council’s roughly $1-million budget. Each year, he also voted on the $600-million plus tax-and-spend plan (sometimes in favor, sometimes against). In addition, he sent us several examples of letters he wrote to the Council Finance chairmen recommending ways to trim city expenses. The Costantino campaign dismisses Lombardi’s budget experience: "There’s a very clear difference between the person who sits at the table, rolls up his sleeves and manages a budget than the person on the City Council who simply has to take a vote," a spokeswoman said. Yet the fact remains that, with 26 years experience, Lombardi played at least some role, however small, in assembling spending plans. It’s fair for Costantino to say he balanced budgets. But his claim that he’s the only candidate who has done so is not entirely accurate. Now on to the second claim, that he’s the only candidate who brought jobs to Providence. Costantino sponsored and pushed for passage of legislation this year that allowed the Industrial Recreational Building Authority, an arm of the state's Economic Development Corporation, to guarantee up to $60 million in bank loans to help free up credit that small businesses need to hire new employees. The first $6.7-million guarantee went to Providence’s CAPCO Steel, which is currently using the money to hire 100 workers, his campaign said. The Costantino camp provided other examples -- his roles in the Assembly’s decision to purchase and renovate the Dunkin’ Donuts Center -- and in legislation that helped rehabilitate the derelict Masonic Temple into a luxury hotel, to name a few. Therefore, it’s accurate to say Costantino has helped bring jobs to the city. Is he the only candidate who did that? Again, Taveras, Young and Scott were not in a position to do so. But Lombardi cited several examples of how he helped bring jobs to Providence. He said he voted in favor of the tax benefits that lured the GTECH headquarters to the capital city. He also supported a variety of ordinances needed for development of the Rhode Island Convention Center. Finally, he told us he added a handful of jobs to the Providence City Council office.

pomt-02294	"Less than 1 percent of 1 percent of the American population has given an amount over $200" to a federal political campaign.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/03/heather-mcghee/heather-mcghee-less-1-1-give-200-or-more-campaigns/	The U.S. Supreme Court decision to throw out a key campaign donation limit unleashed a wave of predictions that the domination of big money will only increase. What the court did on April 2 was say a single donor can give to as many candidates, party funds and political action committees as he or she might desire. Limits are still in place for how much you can give to any individual candidate -- $2,600 -- or a state party -- $10,000 -- and so forth, but so long as there are campaign committees you want to support, you can keep on giving. Before the court’s ruling, there was an overall cap of $123,200. Heather McGhee, president of Demos, a group that believes too much political and economic power lies in the hands of too few people, said the McCutcheon vs. FEC decision makes a bad situation worse. "We have a large donor dominated system," McGhee said on MSNBC. "Less than 1 percent of 1 percent of the American population has given an amount over $200." If McGhee is correct, then that’s a tiny sliver indeed. It would mean 0.01 percent of the public gives over $200 to political campaigns. With a population of about 314 million, that translates into 31,400 people or roughly the population of Juneau, Alaska. The Center for Responsive Politics has tracked federal campaign donations for many years. According to their latest data, 366,000 people have given $200 or more so far in the 2013-14 election cycle. That’s about 10 times more than 31,400. It’s worse news for McGhee if you look at the 2012 election. That year, over 1.2 million people gave $200 or more to a federal candidate, a party, or a PAC. As a percentage, that’s 0.4 percent. When we brought this to the attention of the people at Demos, spokesman Alex Amend faced up to the gaffe. "Heather misspoke — the correct percentage of Americans giving over $200 to political campaigns is 0.12% of the population," Amend said."However, the accurate number still does the job. A tenth of 1 percent is still a minuscule percentage of Americans contributing over $200 in an election cycle." Bob Biersack, a veteran of the Federal Elections Commission and a senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics, agreed. The percentage is "still a pretty small number," Biersack said. The data support McGhee’s broader point about the role of big donors. In 2012, that very small percentage delivered about two-thirds of all the money that came from individual donors. Now, giving $200 doesn’t necessarily mean you are wealthy. You might be a person of moderate means who is very passionate. But the Sunlight Foundation, a group that presses for more campaign finance disclosure, cut the numbers another way. Looking at all federal donations, they found that almost 30 percent came from just about 31,000 people. That’s pretty much McGhee’s 1 percent of 1 percent. And the median donation in this group? Over $26,000, or more than half the median family income in the United States. These people were not of modest means. "The wealthy have always had big impact," Biersack said. "The recent changes have simply reinforced and extended their advantage." The big donors shade strongly Republican. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, among those giving $10,000 or more, 39 percent of the money went to Democrats and 55 percent went to Republicans. Our ruling McGhee said, "Less than 1 percent of 1 percent of the American population has given an amount over $200." McGhee way overshoots the mark. At that donation level, the more accurate statistic is a tenth of 1 percent. McGhee’s staff acknowledge the error. The data do support her bigger point that big donors dominate the campaign system. But McGhee used very precise numbers for rhetorical effect. And she got those numbers wrong by at least a factor of 10. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-04321	Rhode Island has taken its federal Medicaid funding and shown it can run the program more cost-effectively than the federal government.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/28/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-rhode-island-demonstrated-it-can-/	Is Rhode Island’s $2 billion-a-year Medicaid program for the poor a model for the rest of the United States? That was the impression Mitt Romney gave during the third presidential debate Oct. 22, when he talked about how he would balance the federal budget within 8 to 10 years. One thing he would do, he said, is change the way Medicaid is run. "We'll take that health-care program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently. As a governor, I thought please, give me this program. I can run this more efficiently than the federal government, and states, by the way, are proving it. States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively" than the federal government. Did the federal government get a more efficient Medicaid program in Rhode Island by giving it to the state to run? The idea is certainly in line with Romney's philosophy for health-care coverage. He objects to a nationally administered program such as Obamacare but favors comparable programs if they are run individually by the states, such as the program he adopted in Massachusetts. And Romney has also advocated a block grant system in which Medicaid would be turned over to states to run as they see fit. So let's start with some background. Medicaid is a health-care program for the poor, financed by federal and state money. In Rhode Island, the federal government reimburses 52 cents of every dollar spent. The money is distributed by states under rules set by the federal government. States have limited latitude on how the money is spent and require a "waiver" if they want to bend or break the rules. On Jan. 16, 2009, in the final days of the Bush administration, the federal government granted a sweeping "global waiver" to Rhode Island at the request of Republican Gov. Donald Carcieri. It allowed Rhode Island to, for example, move people out of nursing homes into less-expensive community-based care. It also gave the state more power to make unilateral changes to the Medicaid program. In return, the state agreed to foot the bill if costs increased above a pre-determined ceiling over the next five years. But here's the important point for the purpose of this fact check: the waiver didn't, by any measure, completely turn the administration of Medicaid over to Rhode Island. There are still lots of federal strings attached. So contrary to the impression debate viewers might have gotten from Romney's comment, Rhode Island is not a case study in what happens if you make Medicaid a block grant program and turn control over to a state. It does, however, illustrate what can happen when a state gets more flexibility and officials are committed to improving medical care for the poor. So did the 2009 "global waiver" produce a more-efficient program? Several factors complicate the issue. First, the deal gave Rhode Island federal money for things the state was previously paying for by itself, such as early intervention for at-risk children. It saved money for the state, but not the federal government. Second, some of the efficiencies that occurred were initiated before the waiver was granted; in other cases, the waiver wasn't needed to implement them. For example, a large drop in expensive nursing-home use came the year before the waiver took effect. In other words, other states could achieve those efficiencies under the existing federal program. Because of that, the degree of efficiency, as measured by how much money was saved, is also a complicated -- and debated -- question. Gary Alexander, who was secretary of health and human services when the waiver was approved, published a paper with the conservative Galen Institute, pegging the savings at $110 million over 18 months, or $73 million a year. The Romney campaign cites the Alexander paper as evidence that Rhode Island saved money. The liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued a report saying Alexander was wrong because any savings actually resulted from more than $400 million Rhode Island received in federal stimulus money in 2009 and the shifting of some costs previously paid by the state to the federal government. Rhode Island’s current Health and Human Services secretary, Steven Costantino, asked The Lewin Group, a consulting firm, to do a less-partisan analysis after Carcieri left. According to that group's estimates, the waiver itself saved $23 million over three years, or $7.6 million annually, Costantino said. In addition, the deal also provided a $42.7-million windfall for the state over the same three years because the federal government started sharing the costs of some health services, he said. Total savings per year: just under $22 million. To put this in perspective, a savings of $73 million a year (the high number cited by Alexander) is less than 4 percent of the state’s annual $2 billion Medicaid budget; $22 million would be 1.1 percent. (Costantino told us another $32 million was saved over three years thanks to the improvements to the program that the state made without the waiver.) Our ruling Mitt Romney said Rhode Island took its federal Medicaid money and demonstrated that the state could run the program more cost-effectively than the federal government. In context, his statement suggests that the federal government turned over control of the program to Rhode Island. That's not the case. Instead, the state got a waiver from federal rules through a program designed to let states experiment with better ways to provide health care for the poor. That allowed Rhode Island to continue to realign and streamline the program, saving millions. Even without the waiver, there's evidence that the state would have saved money because it was already inaugurating reforms on its own. The degree of savings is debatable, but Romney never cited an amount. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13741	"The top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/26/bernie-sanders/dnc-bernie-sanders-repeats-claim-top-one-tenth-1-o/	Now that the Democratic primary is over, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ speeches have a new feature: an enthusiastic endorsement of Hillary Clinton. But he’s still reciting his favorite stump speech lines about income inequality that he used throughout his campaign. "It is not moral, it is not acceptable, and it is not sustainable that the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent," he said at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia July 25. That statistic is a classic Sanders line — one we’ve looked at twice before. It rates Mostly True, and here’s why. Sanders’ source is a wealth inequality study released in October 2014, produced for the nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research. The study’s authors were economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics. They based their wealth estimates on 2012 tax records. The study found that, as Sanders claimed, the top 0.1 percent and the bottom 90 percent of U.S. households own virtually the same share of all the nation's wealth. The top 0.1 percent was composed of 160,000 families with average wealth of $72.8 million. All told, they owned 22 percent of the nation’s wealth. Meanwhile, the bottom 90 percent included 144 million families with average wealth of $84,000, and they owned an equal 22.8 percent of America’s wealth. "Wealth is getting more concentrated in the United States," the researchers observed, "but this phenomenon largely owes to the spectacular dynamics of fortunes of dozens and hundreds of million dollars, and much less to the growth in fortunes of a few million dollars. Inequality within rich families is increasing." Two other prominent economists — Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Edward Wolff of New York University — told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the study makes solid estimates about wealth inequality. Wolff said he was not aware of another study that examined the wealth of the top 0.1 percent. But other economists have some noted some concerns with the study’s findings. Richard Burkhauser, a professor of policy analysis at Cornell University, told PolitiFact Wisconsin that although the study’s authors are "very well respected economists," he has a major complaint: it excludes Social Security. "To ignore it as they do grossly understates the wealth held by Americans in the bottom 99 percent of the population," Burkhauser said. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said another flaw is that the study doesn’t take into account certain features in the tax law. For example, the way capital income is reported on taxes for higher-income taxpayers versus middle-income taxpayers could skew the results. "Even if one makes the heroic assumption that the data is completely accurate, our friends on the left take these numbers and want people to believe that the wealth of the top 1 percent (or top 10 percent, or top .01 percent, etc) comes at the expense of the rest of us," Mitchell said. "This is generally nonsense. People such as Bill Gates become rich because they generate real value for others. There is no fixed pie." Our ruling Sanders said, "The top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent." His claim repeats a finding from a study by two internationally respected economists, and others back up the study’s results. But the study has been criticized, for example, for not including Social Security in the wealth calculations. Sanders’ claim is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b0f9797-062c-41c3-a8f3-f6c80a03a103	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-07-26T00:17:44	2016-07-25	['None']

pomt-14812	"Road congestion costs rush hour drivers in Austin and Dallas more than $1,000 a year. And in Houston, it’s even more -- almost $1,500 a year."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/nov/24/greg-abbott/gov-greg-abbott-says-traffic-congestion-costs-texa/	Two weeks before the Nov. 3, 2015, election, Gov. Greg Abbott penned an op-ed that ran in the Dallas Morning News on Oct. 16, 2015, and again in the Austin American- Statesman three days later, urging voters to support a state constitutional proposition to funnel more dollars to funding Texas roads. He made the case by citing what daily traffic congestion costs Texas motorists in dollars, over the course of a year. "Road congestion costs rush-hour drivers in Austin and Dallas more than $1,000 a year," Abbott said. "And in Houston, it’s even more -- almost $1,500 a year." Traffic in the state’s major cities can be awful. Does it really cost Texans up to an extra $1,500 a year? Replying to our inquiry, Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the governor drew on research in the 2015 Urban Mobility Scorecard issued August 2015 by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute. The institute has been compiling this data since 1984. In fact, the institute was subject to a 2012 PolitiFact Georgia fact-check questioning the costs Atlanta residents bear to get around town. That claim was ruled Mostly True. For our part, we reached out to Tim Lomax, a senior research engineer at the Texas Transportation Institute, to get a better handle on the math. The group calculates the cost of traffic congestion using four sets of numbers: - the travel delay (amount of extra time a trip takes compared to "free-flowing conditions") during commuting times (6-10 a.m. and 3-7 p.m. Monday-Friday) divided by the commuter population, using figures from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. - the travel delay during off-peak non-commuting times (all other times) divided by the total number of people in the urban area. - excess fuel consumption from being stuck in traffic calculated using the state average cost per gallon for gasoline during peak commuting times. - excess fuel consumption during off-peak non-commuting times. And, according to the institute, the peak congestion cost for Texans in 2014 came out to $17.67 per hour for personal travel. In Houston, the number-crunchers found a 61-hour average yearly delay per commuter and an excess fuel consumption of 29 gallons at $3.12 (average price for a gallon of gasoline in Texas in 2014) for a total congestion cost of $1,490 per commuter, according to the scorecard. When we took a look, however, the math worked out differently. We multiplied the yearly delay (61 hours) by $17.67, and added that to the excess fuel consumption rate (29 gallons at $3.12 per gallon) and got a lower annual average cost of $1168. Our calculations for Austin and Dallas also came up short ($987.48 instead of TTI’s $1159; Dallas came out to $1005.15 compared to the scorecard’s $1185; we found San Antonio to have a cost of $839.88, instead of $1,002). We went back to Lomax to explain the math discrepancy. He said the total congestion cost Abbott and others cite ($1,490 per year per commuter for Houston) includes both peak travel and off-peak travel times; the tables in the scorecard only show figures for peak travel times. Lomax said the scorecard focused on "numbers that seem relevant," and that most people are concerned with what their daily commute costs them. However, he also said that total congestion cost is important to use because it calculates for all times of the day. Critics question calculations Joe Cortright, an urban economist at City Observatory, has been critical of the Urban Mobility Scorecard for years, and often is cited by other urban transportation organizations, as well as in the 2012 PolitiFact Georgia fact-check. We spoke with him over the phone to better understand his qualms. For him, the congestion cost figure is overblown and used mainly to justify the need for more roads by transportation departments. City Observatory is a Knight Foundation-funded think tank focused on debunking "misconceptions" in urban research and city planning. The Transportation Institute’s travel delay compares the extra time it takes to get to your destination due to congestion, compared to how long it would take in free-flow conditions. Cortright argues it’s unreasonable to expect there to be zero congestion on roads during peak times, and impossible to increase the supply of roads to the extent that there would be no travel delays. Also, he says if roads are increased to handle that demand, more people could end up on the roads creating congestion after all. If you can’t drive faster than the speed limit, that represents a cost to you, he said. "I’m not sure anybody, as a matter of public policy, would argue that makes sense." Another component of the total congestion cost is excess fuel consumption. Lomax said the institute uses the state average fuel price for each year. While fuel costs have declined steadily since August 2014, that won’t be reflected until next year’s scorecard. Lomax added that fuel prices account for less than 10 percent of the total congestion cost, and most of that congestion cost is travel time. The Transportation Institute partnered with Inrix, a Seattle-based traffic data provider for this year’s scorecard. Inrix had its own travel time index, which didn’t account for traffic volumes on different roads. The Inrix method would give "every piece of road the same weight," Lomax said in an email, so a portion of the West Loop in Houston would be considered equal to a more sparsely traveled road. The Institute’s method gives more weight to heavily traveled areas such as the 610 Loop because "it carries a lot more people." "Our swings, whether up or down, were not nearly as big as their changes," Lomax said. Cortright with City Observatory also criticizes the Transportation Institute’s lack of peer review in its research. Asked about how the group gathers its data and why a peer review doesn’t occur, Lomax said TTI has a timely topic with a limited shelf life, and does not "wait around six months" for other people to look at the data. Todd Litman with the Victoria Transport Policy Institute, a Canadian independent research organization based in Victoria, British Columbia, criticizes the Urban Mobility Report for "overestimating congestion costs and roadway expansion benefits" and for not incorporating research methods, such as a dedicated literature review. PolitiFact Georgia’s claim from TTI on congestion costs for Atlanta residents cited a University of Connecticut civil and environmental engineering professor Norman Garrick, who said the report doesn’t take other factors such as health care and the environment into account. Research sponsors of the Texas Transportation Institute include the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Texas Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Transportation, often the same organizations that cite the institute’s research as proof of a need for more funding for new roadways. Asked how this could affect the work done, Lomax said it’s not a factor. While TTI has several sponsors, he said the mobility scorecard only has two sponsors: the institute and Inrix. At any given time, anywhere from 250 to 300 projects could be going on at once at TTI, he said. Our ruling Greg Abbott said "Road congestion costs rush hour drivers in Austin and Dallas more than $1,000 a year. And in Houston, it’s even more -- almost $1,500 a year." Abbott’s claim was based on an annual Urban Mobility Report produced by the Texas Transportation Institute. While his figures match those in the report, critics have raised significant questions about how the numbers are calculated, as well as the premise that normal traffic conditions result in a congestion cost to motorists. They also point to the institute’s sponsors, most of which are transportation agencies that can be expected to use the report to advocate for additional funding for road projects.

pomt-02252	Says the Koch brothers want to "protect tax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/11/senate-majority-pac/senate-dem-group-claim-koch-brothers-support-tax-b/	As we’ve noted, Democrats are hellbent on bringing up the Koch brothers as often as possible during this election cycle. They’ve sought to criticize the billionaire brothers and conservative backers on a number of issues — even when the connection appears to be a stretch. Such is the case with an ad from the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic outfit going toe-to-toe on the airwaves with the Koch-supported Americans for Prosperity in a handful of heavily contested Senate races, including Louisiana. "Out-of-state billionaires spending millions to rig the system and elect (Louisiana Republican candidate for Senate) Bill Cassidy," a narrator says as a picture of David and Charles Koch appears on the screen. "Their goal: Another politician bought and paid for. Their agenda: Protect tax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas. Cut Social Security and end Medicare as we know it. They even tried to kill relief for hurricane victims. Cassidy’s billion-dollar backers: They’ve got a plan for him. It’s not good for Louisiana." This ad first came out about a month ago, and it has already earned Four Pinocchios from the Washington Post Fact Checker, the lowest rating on their scale. But given the recent focus on the Koch brothers and the staying power of Democratic attacks on them, we thought we should review the ad ourselves to see if we reached the same conclusion. We’re looking at the claim that the Koch brothers are protecting "tax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas." The Senate Majority PAC said this is in reference to a 2012 bill called the Bring Jobs Home Act. The measure had two key components. The first was to create a tax break for companies that chose to repatriate jobs, meaning bring them back to the United States from overseas. The second part was to bar companies from using a standard tax deduction for moving expenses if they were for work outsourced to other countries. The ad makes it seem like companies that move jobs overseas have a special tax preference carved out for them that grants privileges not awarded other companies. It’s actually a standard business expense deduction used for companies moving 10 blocks or 10,000 miles. The Senate bill would have put overseas moving expenses into a new category by eliminating their ability to claim this standard deduction. The merits of this policy can be debated. (For what it’s worth, the bill failed to pass the Senate. Twice.) But to imply this is a tax cut or special loophole for only businesses that move jobs overseas is misleading. Follow the money Regardless of what the bill does, let’s get to the other issue: Did the Koch brothers try to block it? We asked Senate Majority PAC for their evidence because none was presented in the ad. If what follows sounds like a game of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, that’s because it kind of is. The source for the claim is a blog post written by Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that advocates for a flat tax. When you think of Americans for Tax Reform, the first name that pops into mind is Grover Norquist, not the Koch brothers. Norquist for years has famously collected signatures from Republicans on a pledge not to raise taxes and he first started Americans for Tax Reform in 1985. It turns out Americans for Tax Reform receives some funding from an organization close to the Koch brothers, the Center to Protect Patient Rights. The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan watchdog of campaigns spending, described this organization as one of three "dark money groups tied to the Kochs that did nothing but give out checks." The Center to Protect Patient Rights has given Americans for Tax Reform about $4 million since 2010. Of that, $350,000 came in 2012, the year the Bring Jobs Home Act came up for a vote. The group reported about $30.9 million in contributions that year. While $4 million represents one of Americans for Tax Reform’s largest donations from a single benefactor, it pales in comparison to the amount of money the group has received from another conservative group, Crossroads GPS, an organization run by Republican strategist Karl Rove. Crossroads GPS gave Americans for Tax Reform $30 million since 2010, an overwhelming chunk of the group’s funding. Americans for Tax Reform has "been around a long time and doesn't seem to be a central part of the Koch network," said Viveca Novak, a spokeswoman for the Center for Responsive Politics. "That said, it has received millions in the last few years from a group that is a hub of that network, the Center to Protect Patient Rights." Back to the blog post written by Americans for Tax Reform. The author was not speaking directly about the Bring Jobs Home Act, but rather was "fact-checking" President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech, in which he said "companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas." The blog post said Obama’s claim wasn’t true. That blog passage coupled with Norquist’s anti-tax pledge is evidence enough that the group opposed the Bring Jobs Home Act, Senate Majority PAC said. But we think that’s pretty flimsy ground to stand on. We asked Americans for Tax Reform for their official stance on the Bring Jobs Home Act. A spokesman said they did not take one — a notable development since the organization vocalizes positions on dozens of bills each year and often grades lawmakers on how closely they align their votes with the organization. Americans for Prosperity, which is closely affiliated with the Koch brothers, also said they took no position on the legislation. "We did nothing to try to oppose that bill," said Christopher Neefus, a spokesman for the organization. "We favor lower, simpler corporate taxation without special treatment for favored interests — that would be much broader than what this bill set out to do." Neefus said Americans for Prosperity in the past has supported tax incentives for companies to bring jobs back into the United States. Our ruling Senate Majority PAC claimed the Koch brothers sought to "protect tax cuts for companies that ship our jobs overseas." The ad is misleading in two ways. For starters, there are no carved-out tax cuts for companies that outsource work. There is a standard deduction companies can utilize when they move, but it can be used at home and abroad. Secondly, the organization pinned the Koch brothers’ opposition to a statement from Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that has received only limited funding from the Koch network and never took an official position on the legislation. Americans for Prosperity, a group closer to the Koch brothers, also took no position. A note to ad makers: Supporting negative claims with flimsy evidence won’t win you points on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-00745	"By age 65, the average woman will have lost $431,000 throughout her working career was a result of the pay gap."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/apr/20/mark-herring/herring-says-average-woman-looses-431000-pay-gap-o/	Attorney General Mark Herring was among scores of Democrats across the nation who posted a message on April 14 in recognition of Equal Pay Day. "According to U.S. Census data, by age 65, the average woman will have lost $431,000 throughout her working career as a result of the pay gap," Herring wrote on his Facebook page. We wondered if he’s right. A quick web search showed Herring’s words mirrored statements made by many liberal organizations and politicians since 2012 to quantify the pay disparity between women and men. Ellen Qualls, a senior political adviser to Herring, said the attorney general’s source was a 2012 White House blog headlined "By the Numbers: $431,000." The calculation is based on Census Bureau statistics on the median yearly earnings of males and females, 15 or older, who worked full time for at least 50 weeks. In 2010, the middle pay was $47,715 for males and $36,931 for females. The gap was $10,784. The next step is to multiply the gap by 40 -- representing the number of years one may have worked full time before reaching age 65. You come up with $431,360 and then round down. The lifetime disparity increases slightly if you use the most recent census figures. In 2013, median pay was $50,033 for men and $39,157 for women. The gap rose to $10,876 which, multiplied by 40 years, comes to $435,040. The question that intrigues experts is how much of the gap is attributable to sex discrimination. A 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh concluded that three-fourths of the disparity can be explained by other factors that are common to women: they tend to choose occupations that have relatively low wages; they tend to have degrees leading to lower-paying occupations than men; and they take more time off than men for child-related reasons. The American Association for University Women issued a 2013 report that offered similar explanations, saying the pay gap is partly due to "men’s and women’s choices, especially the choice of college major and the type of job pursued after graduation. For example, women are more likely than men to go into teaching, and this contributes to the pay gap because teachers tend to be paid less than other college graduates." Pamela Coukos, a senior program advisor at the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, said in a July 2012 blog post that "economists generally attribute about 40 percent of the pay gap to discrimination -- making about 60 percent explained by differences between workers or their jobs." The White House Council of Economic Advisers issued a report this month citing 2007 research by two economists at Cornell University: Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn. They concluded that career choice and experience largely accounted for pay disparity. But 41 percent of the gap is unexplained, they concluded, opening up the possibility that some or all of it was caused by discrimination. Our ruling Herring wrote, "According to U.S. Census data, by age 65, the average women will have lost $431,000 throughout her working career as a result of the pay gap." The much-used figure accurately describes the disparity in the median earnings of men and women over a 40-year career. It’s widely accepted by economists that sexism plays a role in the gap, although, perhaps, not the lead part. We quibble, however, with the part of the statement saying the average woman will have "lost" that sum. It ignores the fact that many women chose to go into lower-paying fields than men and make other lifestyle decisions that affect their career earnings. On the whole, we rate Herring’s statement Mostly True.	None	Mark Herring	None	None	None	2015-04-20T00:00:00	2015-04-14	['None']

pomt-13856	Says Attorney General Loretta Lynch "was a member of Bill Clinton's defense team during the 1992 Whitewater corruption probe."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/08/viral-image/meme-resurrects-bogus-claim-2014-about-loretta-lyn/	Want to know why Attorney General Loretta Lynch isn't indicting Hillary Clinton for her email practices? An unsigned viral image posted on Twitter by a self-proclaimed "news organization" suggests an explanation. It shows pictures of Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, who had a controversial meeting with Lynch as his wife was under investigation by the FBI, with the words, "Fun fact of the day. Lynch was a member of Bill Clinton's defense team during the 1992 Whitewater corruption probe." That factoid was debunked years ago. PolitiFact, for one, gave it a Pants on Fire in 2014 — when she was nominated — after the conservative website Breitbart posted it and, eventually, took it down. (Others like Patriot Update and the Christian website WND, have kept the uncorrected story on their sites.) The reason the post is wrong? It's the wrong Loretta Lynch. First, a little background is in order. Whitewater is the name of a failed Arkansas land deal in which Bill and Hillary Clinton were investors. When the deal was inaugurated, he was Arkansas attorney general. The developer behind the project, James McDougal, owned a savings and loan called Madison Guaranty that was also involved in the project. Complicating the affair is the fact that McDougal later hired Rose Law Firm to do some of its legal work, and one of the firm's partners was Hillary Clinton, who had, by then, become Arkansas' first lady. When billing records for the project became lost, and it turned out that Hillary Clinton was signing off on those records, things looked even more suspicious. The records were eventually recovered, and no charges were ever brought against the Clintons despite numerous investigations. The land deal was a bust — the Clintons sold their share in the project to McDougal for $1,000 in 1992, three years after Madison Guaranty failed. The Loretta Lynch who helped Bill Clinton in the Whitewater case is a white woman who got a law degree from Yale and worked on several political campaigns, including Clinton’s. She served as president of the California Public Utilities Commission from 2000-02 and as a commissioner until 2005. Loretta Lynch, the current U.S. attorney general, is a black woman and Harvard Law School graduate who began working as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York in 1990, so she couldn’t have been part of Clinton’s defense a few years later. She was appointed by President Barack Obama on May 3, 2010, as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, an office she previously led from 1999 to 2001. From 2002 to 2010 she was in private practice. She took over the Justice Department in April 2015. The Twitter post, which begins with the message "Why does this matter? Cause it freaking does!" remained posted even after a few commenters pointed out that the Lynches are two different women. The allegation was ridiculous at the time. It's even more ridiculous now because a quick Google search would have revealed that it's wrong. Pants on Fire! (Here's a PolitiFact-approved version of the meme.

pomt-04105	Seven of America’s 10 wealthiest counties are in the Washington, D.C., area.	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/14/jim-jordan/jim-jordan-says-seven-nations-10-wealthiest-counti/	Conservative Ohio Republican Jim Jordan has long preached the need to get government spending under control. In 2011, the congressman from Champaign County voted against raising the nation’s debt ceiling, and he recently opposed a compromise to keep the nation from plunging off a "fiscal cliff" because he felt it delayed needed spending cuts. On Jan. 6, Jordan brought his critique of out-of-control government spending to Fox News Sunday, where he compared the federal government to an 18-year-old with a maxed out credit card and argued that Washington was the only winner in the "fiscal cliff deal," while his constituents in Ohio lost money. "Washington always wins," said Jordan, whose congressional district was recently altered to include parts of Lorain County "The politicians, the consultants, the folks here always win. In fact, seven of the 10 wealthiest counties are in the D.C. area. . . . It's regular Americans who lose and it's about time we said stop this madness, cut up the credit card, we want a solution. Not another Washington deal which helps D.C." PolitiFact Ohio thought Jordan’s point about the relative wealth of the counties around Washington, D.C. was worth exploring. It didn’t take long to find the statistics behind his assertion. An article in The Washington Post last September that examined 2011 Census data verified Jordan’s claim that seven of the 10 counties in the nation with the highest household incomes are in the Greater Washington region. Loudoun, Fairfax and Arlington counties in Virginia held the top three spots with respective median household incomes of $119,134, $105,797 and $100,735. Howard County, Maryland, ($98,953) ranked fifth. Prince WIlliam County in Virginia ($95,146) ranked seventh. Fauquier County, Virginia ($93,762) was eighth. Montgomery County in Maryland ($92,909) placed 10th. That’s seven of the top 10. And just for good measure, nearby Charles County in Maryland ranked 11th with a median household income of $91,733. The District of Columbia itself, which the Census Bureau compared to both states and counties, had a median income of around $63,000, which would have been 125th among counties and fifth among states. Just two counties in Jordan’s home state ranked among the nation’s 100 most affluent for 2011. Delaware County, north of Columbus, ranked 18th with an income of $85,365. Warren County northeast of Cincinnati ranked 80th at $69,201. Neither, by the way, is in his House district. According to Census Bureau estimates, Ohio’s $45,749 median household income put the state in the bottom third, well below the national average of $50,502. Maryland ranked No. 1 in 2011, with a median income of $70,004. Virginia ($61,882 ) ranked ninth. Mississippi had the nation’s lowest median household income: $36,919. The Washington Post attributed the region’s relative opulence to "the stability of an economy built on the pillars of the federal government, its legions of contractors and a flourishing high-tech sector." It noted that the Washington metropolitan area has the nation’s highest level of adults with college degrees, that a high proportion of its households have two wage earners and that many of its married couples put off childbearing until they’re professionally established. The Post said that in 2007, before the recession began, five counties in suburban Washington made it into the top 10. By 2010, there were six. The seven in the latest ranking are "all-time high," it said. "It’s not only that we have low unemployment and a lot of dual-income households," Stephen Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University told the Post. "We lost a few government jobs, but not the high-paying, professional business-service jobs that are still growing, if not as fast as they used to. Since the rest of the country is in such poor shape, we just have to show a little bit of growth here, and we look pretty good." Jordan’s claim that the Washington area contains seven of the 10 wealthiest counties in the nation checks out. On the Truth-o-Meter, his claim rates True.

pomt-00736	Women make only 78 percent of what men make for the same job.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/22/viral-buzzfeed/viral-video-misfires-on-wage-gap/	The two-minute video is hilarious. And unsettling. A young woman and a male coworker, who appear to be about the same age, are examining their paychecks when the woman discovers she makes only 78 percent as much on payday as her cubicle mate. "That’s so weird because we have the same job," the woman says. "That’s not fair." In protest, the woman then proceeds to do only 78 percent of her job, much to the dismay of her male co-workers and bewildered bosses. The comedic attack on the gender wage-gap struck a nerve. As of this week, it had 9.7 million views, thanks to social media sites. It was released on the site BuzzFeed in conjunction with Equal Pay Day (April 14th ) and entitled "One Woman Discovers the Wage Gap." PolitiFact couldn’t resist. We’ve been here before. But it ‘s worth another visit based on the viral dissemination of the video. The bottom line is this. There is a gender wage-gap. But it is not 22 percent for men and women of the same age performing the same job. That is an urban myth perpetuated by politicians and advocacy groups misreading Census data compiled on cumulative earnings by men and women. PolitiFact has given you the nuts and bolts about gender wage-gap statistics in past fact-checks. You can read the two most important works in this area here and here. Basically, there is a wage gap. That is a fact. But it tends to diminish when you compare women and men in the exact same jobs who have the same levels of experience and education. The video implies the woman and her better-paid cubicle-mate are otherwise equals. Their cubicles are at least identical and the co-workers appear to be about the same age. We reached out to the folks at BuzzFeed. They shared word from the video’s producer, Chantel Houston, that a research team had looked at information from the White House and four other sources before deciding to go with the 78 percent statistic. This included a 2014 report in the liberal groupThink Progress, which cited 2013 data from the U.S. Census Bureau showing that the average woman working full-time and year-round was making 78 percent of what a man with similar employment. The report said that was a slight but not statistically different increase from 77 percent in 2012, and not far off the wages in 2007. The double-digit gender pay-gap relying on U.S. Census Bureau data has been widely reported. That data has shown women’s total wages were about 23 percent lower than the total amount of men's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. The Census Bureau did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield much smaller wage gaps. BuzzFeed actually looked at some sources that got it right, but then produced a misleading video. For example, BuzzFeed reviewed a CNN Money report from last October, which said that 78 percent stat was "an aggregate of all men and women in the workplace" that doesn't take into account important variables like education level, total hours worked, type of work and job tenure. A wage gap does exist, the show’s audience heard. But CNN Money talked about a study from the American Association of University Women that controlled for college major, occupation, age, geographical region, hours worked and more, and found there was still a 7 percent wage gap between male and female college grads a year after graduation. In addition, the video’s researchers said they reviewed a recent report from the Pew Research Center, which says women have to work about 60 extra days, or about three months, to earn what men did by the end of the previous year, based on the White house estimate that full-time working women earn 77 percent of what their male counterparts earn. But for young women, the wage gap is even smaller – at 93 percent – meaning they caught up to their same-aged male counterparts by roughly the last week in January of this year, the Pew Research Center estimates. Some studies put the real gender-based wage gap at half that. And some studies show that highly educated single women in urban areas actually make more than their male counterparts. Our ruling. The BuzzFeed video takes a legitimate statistic and illustrates it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it actually is. The 78 percent figure is real, but for culmulative wages. It does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure. And, unlike the video, the Census data never attempted to compare equal pay for equal work. Using this statistic to illustrate the gender pay-gap is misleading. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Viral BuzzFeed	None	None	None	2015-04-22T00:00:00	2015-04-20	['None']

pomt-13359	Says Proposition 205 "blocks market entry" for new marijuana dispensaries.	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2016/sep/30/arizonans-responsible-drug-policy/does-arizonas-recreational-marijuana-initiative-bl/	Arizona is one of five states where voters will decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana this November. Our partners at ABC15 have reported on the weed effort in Arizona, noting that individual, anti-weed contributions outnumber pro-weed contributions almost four to one. A Sept. 15 attack ad from an anti-marijuana group, Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, portrays the potential passage of Proposition 205, which would legalize recreational marijuana, as a monopoly for existing medical marijuana dispensaries. "Prop. 205 is a 20-page special interest goldmine that elevates the rights of users over the public," the ad’s narration claims. "(It) blocks market entry for new dispensaries." The first medical marijuana dispensary in Arizona opened in December 2012 after voters approved the act in November 2010. But, we wondered, would new dispensaries hoping to sell legal, recreational pot not be able to do so under this initiative? The state’s Health Services Department currently regulates medical marijuana in Arizona. If Prop. 205 passes, a new state agency, the Arizona Department of Marijuana Licenses and Control, would regulate both recreational and medical marijuana. Part of this would be done through a seven-member Marijuana Commission within the new agency, which would approve and deny licenses. Ciara Archer, a spokeswoman for Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, said existing medical marijuana dispensaries are given preference to become retail marijuana outlets. "Newcomers to the market cannot even apply for licenses until after Dec. 17, 2017, nearly a full year after medical marijuana business owners can apply and have licenses awarded to them," Archer said. But that is not the same thing as an outright block on new dispensaries. Will Humble, a health policy expert at the University of Arizona, said the new agency still has to set several rules if Prop. 205 passes, including how much pot each retail store can produce, as well as a cap on the number of stores permitted. "While the existing medical marijuana dispensaries would have a distinct advantage to becoming a retail store, it’s not a total blocked entry. The Prop. 205 cap is 147 dispensaries," Humble said. According to Humble, the agency could also add an undetermined number of new stores to "meet demand" in 2021. Barrett Marson, a spokesman with the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, a pro-marijuana group, said there is "certainly growth" for new licenses in the initiative. Moreover, according to the initiative’s language, the new agency would not set rules on recreational marijuana until September 2017. Our ruling The ad claims Prop. 205 "blocks market entry for new dispensaries." While the ballot language does give an upper hand to existing medical marijuana dispensaries, it does not completely block a new dispensary from entering a legal recreational marijuana market. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f8897d46-310c-461d-9ec1-8cdae62d5ba4	None	Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy	None	None	None	2016-09-30T12:00:00	2016-09-15	['None']
pomt-14692	We've "lifted high school graduation rates to new highs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/13/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-high-school-graduation-rates-are/	During his 2016 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama cited education as an area of bipartisan agreement. "We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job," he said. "The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we’ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, (and) boosted graduates in fields like engineering." We wanted to see if high school graduation rates have never been higher. At first glance, he appears to be correct. In December, the U.S. Education Department reported that the rate had reached 82.3 percent, and the department billed it as a "new record high." But there's an important caveat. As the department acknowledged, the 82.3 percent rate was "the highest level since states adopted a new uniform way of calculating graduation rates five years ago." It's a key distinction because high school graduation rates can be a slippery topic and difficult to track. Different states and different school districts have used different measures over the years. For example, some states included private school students who received public funding. That's why a uniform system was adopted. The last time the rates were close to being this high was for the class that graduated in 1970, when the Education Department pegged the rate at 78.7 percent. Yet because the current method for calculating rates is only 5 years old, it's not clear that the 1970 rate, or even the subsequent ones, are comparable to current rates. Since the mid 1970s until around 2008, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, the annual rates consistently stayed at 75 percent or below. With the new system, begun with the 2010-11 school year, rates were calculated to be 79 percent once again and have since been rising, albeit slowly. It was 80 percent for 2011-12, 81.4 percent for 2012-13, and 82.3 percent for 2013-14, the most recent rate available. Even when we checked this statistic two years ago, there was a consensus in the education community that graduation rates were rising. But uncertainty persists about those old rates. If Obama had restricted his time frame to the past four years, the numbers would be on firmer ground. But he didn't. He gave the impression that these were the highest rates ever. Because Obama's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-03675	"Abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973."	false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/25/charles-van-zant/florida-republican-says-without-kkk-or-holocaust-a/	While debating abortion rights, a Republican Florida House member made a startling claim: Doctors who perform abortions are to blame for reducing the African-American population in the United States. "In America alone, without the Nazi Holocaust, without the Ku Klux Klan, Planned Parenthood and other abortionists have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973," said the House member, Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights. Van Zant is sponsoring a bill (HB 845) that would criminalize abortions performed because of the race or sex of the fetus, and during debate, he suggested that abortion groups such as Planned Parenthood are targeting African-Americans. Do statistics about the African-American population in the United States support his claim? What we found in this case is that Van Zant makes a complicated, and largely unsubstantiated leap of logic. Taken at its most literal meaning, his statement is preposterous. The black population grew by 67 percent, not decreased by 25 percent, from 1973 to 2010, according to U.S. Census figures. Interpreting his statement the way Van Zant and other anti-abortion groups intend -- that the U.S. black population would be at least 25 percent higher were it not for Roe v. Wade -- is also fraught with problems. To start, federal data for abortions is imprecise, and that’s not even factoring in the additional layer of abortions by race. Van Zant’s claim is largely based on guesstimates. Then there’s the bigger issue of arguing that every fetus would be alive today had the pregnancy not have been aborted, a premise social scientists called over-simplified and inaccurate. We’ll take you through it. How does Van Zant get there? Van Zant’s legislative aide gave us a packet of information relating to his remarks, including print-outs from Abort73.com, an antiabortion advocacy group, on abortion and race. Here, we found a similarly worded version of Van Zant’s claim. "From 1973 to 2012, abortion reduced the black population by 30 percent, and that doesn’t even factor in all the children that would have been born to those aborted a generation ago," Abort73.com states. The website explains how it gets to 30 percent (we’re not vouching for the methodology, mind you): 17 million black babies were aborted since Roe v. Wade (55 million total abortions, as reported by National Right to Life, multiplied by 31 percent, which is what they say is the average rate of abortions by black women since 1973). The black population (people who identified as only black, not a combination of races, to the Census) was around 39 million people in 2010. So the black population, once you include 17 million would-be babies, should be 56 million people. That’s how they get the talking point. So is it reasonable or accurate? Data limitations and manipulations The U.S. Census Bureau, not surprisingly, does not come up with projections for what a population would have been without abortions. (We checked.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not have a complete record of the number of abortions on black mothers since Roe v. Wade. We knew from the start the agency’s abortion data is incomplete, as not every state reports abortion data to the feds. Florida, for example, reports its abortions but does not break down the mother’s race or age. The center, which only started collecting racial/ethnic abortion data from state health departments in 1990, compiled this spreadsheet for us, emphasizing it has many caveats. By the CDC’s count, there have been 39.3 million abortions since 1973. Between 1990 and 2009, 4 million of those were by black women. We checked with the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports access to abortion and uses a different method to count abortions. Instead of collecting data from state health departments, the Guttmacher Institute surveys a sample of abortion providers every few years. From 1973 to 2008, the most recent year for which their data is available, nearly 50 million legal abortions occurred in the United States. The Guttmacher Institute also does not have a total for abortions by race and ethnicity since 1973, as the group started collecting demographic data of women obtaining abortions in 1994. Their findings do not offer totals, just a proportion of abortions to each racial group. In 2008, white women accounted for 36 percent of abortions, black women for 30 percent, Hispanic women for 25 percent and non-Hispanic women of other races for 9 percent, according to Guttmacher’s tally. Not so simple There is one thing not up for debate: If all of the black women who had abortions had decided to carry their pregnancies to term, there would be more black people alive today. But Van Zant’s number is considerably inflated, social scientists told us. "The claim that all terminated pregnancies would be alive today is false," said Elwood Carlson, a Florida State University sociology professor who specializes in demography for reproductive health, adult mortality and family. Some of the pregnancies would have ended by stillbirths and spontaneous abortions, which end an estimated 15 to 20 percent of pregnancies, said Karin Brewster, director of FSU’s Center for Demography and Population Health. Plus, black Floridians are twice as likely as white Floridians to have spontaneous pregnancy losses, Carlson said. And even among the pregnancies ending with birth, some of those babies would have died as infants. The rate of infant death after live birth is also twice as high for black Floridians as for white Floridians, he said. Further, he said, the risk of involuntary death for black Floridians is twice as high as the risk to white Floridians from conception through adulthood. "Induced abortions are only the tip of an iceberg of unequal life chances faced by black citizens of Florida, an iceberg that has been part of life in the state for at least the last half-century and which is showing no signs of drifting away," he said. Elwood criticized Van Zant for isolating black abortions and not also mentioning there would be more white, Hispanic and Asian citizens if not for abortion. Other criticisms from the sources we consulted said it is inappropriate to take correlational data and make causal inferences, and that we don’t know what effect an abortion has on subsequent family planning. Some of the people counted in 2010 may not have been conceived had their mothers elected to carry their first pregnancy. Before we close, we’ll point out that Van Zant’s claim does not bolster his case that minority abortions happen because of race, as most abortions are performed because the mother cannot afford a child or having a child would interfere with other responsibilities at work, school or to other children. Our ruling Van Zant made a fiery case for his bill preventing gender- and race-based abortions, saying abortion providers like Parent Parenthood -- without the Nazis or the KKK -- "have reduced our black population by more than 25 percent since 1973." Van Zant’s statement is wildly incorrect by the most literal measure -- the African-American population has increased since 1973. There’s also problems with the claim if you buy into Van Zant’s logic. Namely, abortion statistics are incomplete and/or difficult to interpret. And there’s no one-to-one correlation between an abortion and the population today. We rate this claim False.	None	Charles Van Zant	None	None	None	2013-04-25T18:33:57	2013-04-18	['None']
pomt-09127	Alex Sink was "the first official who said that BP should pay $25 million for an ad campaign to promote Florida tourism."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jun/16/james-carville/carville-says-sink-was-first-official-say-bp-shoul/	Since the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, several Florida politicians have been talking tough and trying to take credit for demanding a stronger response on the oil spill. And now Democratic political consultant and Louisiana resident James Carville says CFO Alex Sink, a Democratic candidate for Florida governor, should get props for being first to ask BP for tourism ad bucks. Here's what Carville wrote in a June 8 fundraising letter for Sink's campaign, which he supports: "Alex is the one who called on BP's CEO to come to Florida to explain how he expects to protect Florida's economy and environment. She was also the first official who said that BP should pay $25 million for an ad campaign to promote Florida tourism." We wondered if Sink really was the "first official" to say BP should fund a campaign to promote Florida. How quickly politicians make such a request is relevant because the spill started April 20 and the tourism season in part of the state gets underway Memorial Day weekend. For starters, we need to set the parameters for "official." Appointed officials? Anyone in elected office? Any statewide official? That's unclear from Carville's letter, and Carville's office referred us to the Sink campaign. Spokesman Kyra Jennings told us in an e-mail that the reference was to the "first elected official in the state (which I believe she was, at least high profile or statewide elected official)." For Sink's part, Jennings sent us a link to a Bay News 9 TV story about a May 8 press conference Sink had in St. Petersburg after she met with a BP representative. That story stated, "According to Sink, she has asked BP to fund a global media campaign to explain to tourists that the state is open for business, to consider fronting or advancing money on behalf of small businesses and coastal communities for interruption claims." On May 10, Sink wrote a letter to BP asking that it "fully fund the cost of a worldwide advertising campaign to put the brakes on the economic damage to our state's number-one industry." Neither the TV news story posted on the website nor Sink's letter included a specific dollar request from BP. Gov. Charlie Crist announced on May 25 that $25 million had been wired to the state. Jennings also pointed to a St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald story on May 26 about a press conference Crist held about the tourism ad money. The article stated: "It was Sink on May 10 who first demanded that the oil giant BP pay for a TV ad blitz aimed at shoring up Florida tourism.'' So Sink pushed BP for the tourism ad money on May 10, and even raised the idea on May 8. What about other statewide elected officials? Jennings sent us a link to an Associated Press article about Gov. Crist asking BP to provide about $35 million for tourism ads on May 12. Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey confirms for PolitiFact Florida that Crist first sought tourism ad dollars from BP on that date. As for the rest of the state cabinet, spokesmen for Attorney General Bill McCollum and Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson said neither sought tourism ad dollars from BP. The only other statewide elected officials in Florida are our two senators. Sen. Bill Nelson did not seek tourism ad dollars, according to his spokesperson. Sen. George LeMieux's spokesman said he didn't think LeMieux asked for tourism ad money, but never gave a definitive answer. We searched news articles and press releases and could find no such proposal from LeMieux. So Sink was the first statewide elected official to demand tourism ad money from BP. But Carville's letter said she was "the first official" and we think a reasonable person would not limit the statement to statewide officials. Next we contacted Visit Florida, the state's tourism office, which received money to pay for a campaign promoting Florida. CEO Chris Thompson told us that he spoke on the phone with state Rep. Marti Coley, R-Marianna, while she attended a May 4 town hall in Fort Walton Beach. "Rep. Coley was the one that seemed to be taking the lead," Thompson said. "'She said, 'If BP was willing to make some funding available for tourism promotion could you put it to good use?' And I said, 'Yes ma'am.' '' Coley helped connect Visit Florida with BP and two days later, on May 6, Visit Florida had a proposal ready for $19.45 million. That proposal later grew to $34.75 million, Thompson said, because the Governor's Office wanted a more significant initial response. Thompson said that he did not discuss the tourism ad proposal directly with Crist but did discuss it with Chris Hart, the director of the Governor's Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development. "Even though I didn't have a conversation with Gov. Crist, his office was in on the conversations," Thompson said. "The first politician that got me involved was Marti Coley." We interviewed Coley about the May 4 town hall meeting. "One thing we kept hearing from everyone was they were being inudated with cancellations," she said, referring to hotels and charter boats. She said she asked a BP representative attending the town hall meeting if BP would help advertise through Visit Florida and other organizations that the beaches were open. "I called our state agency, which does our advertising, and said, 'Put a proposal together,' " Coley said. We also talked to Hope Lanier, the BP spokesperson at that meeting. Lanier said Coley "stood up in the meeting and volunteered to be a point person to work with BP and VISIT FLORIDA toward trying to pull together a workable solution for tourism funding." PolitiFact Florida could not find news coverage of the town hall meeting in a Nexis search and when the state did get the $25 million, Coley didn't appear to take credit for it in a press release. But she did in a June 9 article in the Jackson County Floridan. (Coley is running for re-election in Florida House District 7.) The article stated: "In response to the disaster, Coley mentioned to attendees that she has been working with Visit Florida -- Florida's main tourism advocate -- and BP officials to get the initial $25 million contribution from the oil company to go towards damage control. Coley says she worked hard to ensure BP officials stepped up to their financial responsibility of lessening the impact on tourism with an advertising campaign. She is now pushing for an additional contribution for further efforts, but all is up to Gov. Charlie Crist at this time." Officials at Visit Florida also recalled state Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, speaking up about the need for tourism ads early. Gaetz's chief legislative aide, Chris Clark, said Gaetz spoke with a BP representative on May 2 to ask "if they would be willing to help with advertising" but did not ask for a specific dollar amount. Sink's campaign did not provide any documentation that she specifically asked for $25 million, either, but we think the more interesting point is whether she was the "first official" to say BP should give the state money for a tourism ad campaign. We find evidence that other state officials spoke up earlier than Sink, though she was the first statewide elected official to raise the issue. Carville's letter is unspecific on this point, so we have to consider what a reasonable person would think. And by the accounts of Visit Florida, we find others spoke up sooner. We rule this Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15005	"380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/oct/08/debbie-wasserman-schultz/how-many-americans-have-been-killed-mass-shootings/	In the wake of the mass shooting at a community college in Oregon, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that the "national epidemic" of such incidents demands a response from Congress. She directed some of her criticism at former Gov. Jeb Bush -- one of the Republican presidential candidates from her home state of Florida: "A message for Jeb Bush: 380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone. ‘Stuff’ doesn't just ‘happen.’ Inaction happens," she said in an Oct. 2 tweet. (Here’s the background of what Bush said.) A reader asked PolitiFact to look at her statistical claim, because if you divide victims by shootings, then the numbers suggest that there are less than two deaths per "mass" shooting. We found that Wasserman Schultz used an overly broad definition of what most people would consider a mass shooting. A look at the statistics Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman said she was citing a report in the Washington Post’s Wonkblog, which stated that the Oregon shooting brought the total of mass shootings this year to 294. The statistic came from Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowdsourced site, which defines mass shooting as any in which four or more people are shot, regardless of whether they die or are injured. But that definition is more broad than some other definitions, which we will get into later. Mass Shooting Tracker showed 294 mass shootings as of Oct. 1. About 122 of those incidents -- or about 42 percent -- involved zero fatalities. The shootings killed 379 people and injured 1,094. Brock Weller, a Portland, Ore., resident who launched the website in 2013, told PolitiFact he gets his information from news reports. Weller said he supports more gun control "but the site is just data and is no more political than a phone book." While the website defines mass shootings to include fatalities and injuries, a key federal government report defined "mass shooting" and "mass murder" as four or more fatalities. The federal government’s more restrictive definition means it tends to count fewer incidents than Mass Shooting Tracker. Using 2013, the most recent year for which federal data is available, the Congressional Research Service found 25 mass shooting incidents -- far less than the 363 counted by Mass Shooting Tracker. We looked for 2015 data for the federal definition of mass shootings, but it isn’t yet available. Based on its definitions, we would expect the total to be significantly lower than Mass Shooting Tracker, but we can’t say by how much. USA Today has been tracking the data and found approximately 18 mass killings by firearms so far in 2015. A spokesman for Wasserman Schultz defended her use of a broad definition of mass shooting. "I think the main point is that mass shootings that result in both deaths and injuries are occurring too frequently in this country," spokesman Sean Bartlett said. "And it’s both reasonable and publicly understood that a mass shooting does not necessarily have to require a minimum amount of deaths, because the intent of the shooter is to kill and instill fear. Regardless of the outcome of a shooting, there are still serious physical and psychological effects." Experts’ caveats An academic told us that one problem with Mass Shooting Tracker is it lumps together incidents that are different -- for example, those shot in bar fights are counted along with school shootings. "This is not consistent with the motivations behind events like Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson, or Sandy Hook, and therefore are not comparable in the way we think of mass shootings," said Jaclyn Schildkraut, at State University of New York System. "By including such events to try and quantify a phenomenon (though the loss of one life is one too many), these sources essentially are inflating the statistics." Northeastern University professor James Alan Fox said it’s the fatal shootings that draw the most attention. "If six people are shot and they survive, it has nowhere near the impact as six people killed. ...It’s qualitatively different," he said. Politicians or others who want to make a point about guns choose a set of data and a definition that reinforces the point they want to make. People who want more gun control tend to choose more expansive definitions. "Those who want to create a sense of crisis over the violence will tend to use lower cutoffs, while those who want to minimize the problem will use higher cutoffs," said Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, "380 Americans have been killed in 294 mass shootings in 2015 alone." She cited the crowdsourcing site Mass Shooting Tracker, which showed 379 people killed in 296 mass shootings. But Mass Shooting Tracker uses an extremely broad definition of what many people would consider a mass shooting. If she had used a more restrictive definition that only counts incidents with deaths, as the federal government does, she would have come up with a much lower number. The Congressional Research Service counted 25 incidents in 2013, compared with 363 incidents counted by Mass Shooting Tracker. The claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/56b4d880-7973-452f-9c07-15cf56b8aa09	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2015-10-08T16:39:19	2015-10-02	['United_States']
pomt-09231	Bill McCollum explained his lack of action on mortgage fraud by saying, "You can't do everything."	true	/florida/statements/2010/may/13/florida-democratic-party/bill-mccollum-curbing-mortgage-fraud-you-cant-do-e/	Florida Democrats last week attacked Attorney General Bill McCollum in a press release, saying he didn't do enough to curb mortgage fraud. His "flippant response to homeowners in trouble," according to the Democrats, was, "You can’t do everything." We wondered if the Republican gubernatorial candidate was indeed so "flip," especially at a time when mortgage flipping fraud was so pervasive in Florida. The state has ranked first nationwide in mortgage fraud every year since 2006. Indeed, we found the Democrats quoted him correctly. On July 25, 2009, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune ran a front-page article in which reporter Jeremy Wallace noted that McCollum had acknowledged that his agency hadn’t done enough to stop more than 10,000 cases of potentially illegal real estate deals uncovered by the West Florida newspaper (the Democrats' campaign literature cites the Herald-Tribune article but gives an incorrect date of July 25, 2007). In the story, McCollum cited a lack of resources and his agency’s limited jurisdiction over criminal mortgage fraud for his inability to do more. The newspaper noted that McCollum had formed a task force in 2007 to investigate mortgage fraud cases, but that other consumer issues took priority. And so when a Sarasota reporter asked McCollum in an interview in Venice why he hadn’t done more on mortgage fraud prior, McCollum replied: "It’s not the only thing we do. You can’t do everything." It's worth noting that McCollum gave his response to the Herald-Tribune – and, not as the Democrats say, to "homeowners in trouble." Still, the Democrats were right about his words and quoted him accurately. We find their statement True.	None	Florida Democratic Party	None	None	None	2010-05-13T17:51:03	2010-05-13	['None']

pomt-00682	"The people of Tiverton have historically supported [gambling measures] at a rate higher than the rest of the state."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/may/07/john-taylor-2/twin-river-chairman-john-taylor-says-tiverton-vote/	A month after announcing an agreement to purchase the Newport Grand slots parlor for an undisclosed price, owners of the Twin River casino in Lincoln unveiled a plan on April 21, 2015, to move the Newport Grant operation to Tiverton, building a new facility near the town's northern border with Massachusetts. Why move to Tiverton? John Taylor, chairman of the board of Twin River, was asked that question during WPRI-TV's Newsmakers during a show recorded April 24. "We were looking for a place with minimal impacts to the local community," Taylor said. "We were looking for a location which was proximate to where Newport Grand's customers primarily come from, and today those customers come from Southeastern Massachusetts and Aquidneck Island," which covers Portsmouth, Middletown and Newport. "One of the other things we looked at is propensity in the past to support gaming measures, and the people of Tiverton have historically supported [such measures], at a rate higher than the rest of the state, which demonstrated in our mind an openness to the issue," he said. We were interested in whether Taylor was accurately characterizing Tiverton's past support for gambling measures, particularly because it might indicate whether voters there might give it the local approval required for a casino to be built there. We contacted Twin River spokeswoman Patti Doyle and, while waiting to hear from her, we went looking for gambling ballot questions that might have served as the basis for Taylor's statement. Ballotpedia, the questions website, says there have been five statewide gambling questions since 1996. Four seem relevant to this fact check. (The fifth deals with requiring approval of voters before a gambling establishment can be relocated.) In 2006, Question 1 asked voters to authorize a resort casino in West Warwick. That proposal was defeated. In 2012, two questions -- one allowing casino games at Twin River, the other at Newport Grand -- were approved, although Newport voters rejected the Newport Grand proposal. In 2014, a new proposal to authorize casino gambling at Newport Grand was approved in a statewide vote, but lost again in Newport, where approval was also required for passage. When we checked the votes with the Rhode Island Board of Elections, we confirmed the tallies Doyle sent us and found a clear pattern. Here are the various approval rates: Year Question R.I. Tiverton 2006 Question 1: Gambling in West Warwick 37.0% 41.9% 2012 Question 1: Table games at Twin River 70.8% 74.7% 2012 Question 2: Table games at Newport Grand 66.5% 73.3% 2014 Question 1: Table games at Newport Grand 56.3% 65.8% In every case, Tiverton voters approved gambling provisions by a wider margin than voters statewide. Last year, the number of Tiverton voters approving table games at Newport was nearly 17 percent higher than the state as a whole. The big question, of course, is whether Tiverton voters' degree of support will be as high if the gambling facility is going to be located in their town. Taylor's meeting Monday night with the Town Council didn't offer many clues, but the casino plans aren't going to be firmed up until November. But if Twin River is looking to set up a facility in a community that is receptive to a casino, it looks like Tiverton is a good bet. We rate Taylor's claim as True.

pomt-04135	Says "last year the graduation rate for our combined six-district footprint jumped 5.5 percent."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/jan/04/sam-adams/did-graduation-rate-portland-area-jump-55-percenta/	With his term officially over, Sam Adams took some time to look back at his tenure as Portland mayor. In a newsletter, he recapped what he said were his biggest accomplishments -- from arts and transportation to economic development and education. The education category caught our attention -- in part because the mayor has little control over the way public schools operate. In the introduction to his term-in-review, Adams said the city is now on track to greatly increase the graduation rate in high schools over the next few years, thanks to a trend that began while he was in office. "Last year," he wrote, "the graduation rate for our combined six-district footprint jumped 5.5 percent (from 56.8 percent to 62.3 percent)." We wondered whether he had that last bit right. Portland City Hall reporter Brad Schmidt forwarded us correspondence with Adams’ former spokeswoman Caryn Brooks, who noted that their source was All Hands Raised, an education nonprofit. All Hands Raised analyzed data from the Oregon Department of Education and found that the percentage of students graduating on time rose to 62.3 percent in the most recent data from 56.8 percent the year before -- an increase of 5.5 percentage points. (Now, wonks among us will note that the actual percentage increase is roughly 9.7 and that Adams should have said percentage points. But we’re going to let that go because he included both years’ graduation rates. It’s clear what he meant.) The numbers aren’t wrong -- but there’s a big caveat: The 5.5 point increase may not be as robust as it appears. Last January, Portland Public Schools announced a 5 percentage point increase in its graduation rate from the 2009-10 school year to the 2010-11 school year. It was an eye-popping improvement for any district, but especially for Portland, which has one of the lowest rates in the state. The problem, though, as The Oregonian’s education reporter Betsy Hammond discovered, was that "most of the gain is due to deeper digging through old records, not new techniques teachers and counselors used with students." The district, it turned out, had not been closely tracking students that transferred and had been counting them as dropouts. After the class of 2011 graduated, Hammond reported, the district's manager of state reporting "asked principals to dig through paper files to check whether students whose electronic records indicated they were dropouts in fact had transferred away." The principals found that was the case for hundreds of students and documented the transfers. That raised the 2011 graduation rate substantially and gave an artificially rosy picture of the district's year-over-year improvement. Hammond calculated that "better handling of paperwork accounted for 3 percentage points of that 5-point gain." In May 2012, Portland Public went back and dug deeper into both the 2011 and 2010 graduation data. The state was convinced by the district's new evidence and revised upward Portland's graduation rate for both years. Those higher figures are the ones All Hands Raised used in their analysis. However, the size of the year-to-year increase is likely inflated because it was easier to track down accurate information about the 2011 graduates than the 2010 graduates. Basically, it's hard to say how much of the increase is better paperwork and how much is genuine improvement in graduating students. We spoke with Nate Waas Shull at All Hands Raised and asked him if his organization knew how much of the area-wide increase was due to the improved paperwork. "There's no way to know," he said. "That would be a pretty complex study." Still, he said, it certainly had something to do with the recent improvement. "My sense is that, across the board, every district has become motivated to really know, to no longer let kids disappear. Districts are tracking students down." We called and emailed Adams’ temporary spokeswoman for comment but never heard back. We did get Amy Ruiz, Adams’ chief of staff, on the phone. She said simply that improving graduation rates takes time. In reviewing his tenure as Portland mayor, Sam Adams said that the city was well on its way to improving graduation rates. Last year alone, he said, "the graduation rate for our combined six-district footprint jumped 5.5% (from 56.8% to 62.3%)." We checked Adam’s figure and found that it relied on graduation statistics that benefited from, at least in part, better record keeping and not just better student retention. Waas Shull at All Hands Raised said as much. That’s an important detail. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2013-01-04T16:49:24	2012-12-20	['None']
pomt-06196	Says that as Wisconsin governor, "we ended welfare."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/11/tommy-thompson/did-gop-us-senate-candidate-tommy-thompson-end-wel/	Wisconsin Republican Tommy Thompson made a sweeping statement in announcing his candidacy for the U.S. Senate on Dec. 1, 2011, saying that while he served as the state’s governor, "we ended welfare." As in, completely? Thompson, during his brief run for president in 2007, called himself the "father of welfare reform." With experts agreeing he was a national leader in that area, Thompson’s claim earned a True from our colleagues at PolitiFact National. Reforms similar to those made in Wisconsin were later adopted at the federal level under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, who had previously made welfare changes as governor of Arkansas. But reforming welfare isn’t the same as ending it. As Thompson tries to burnish his conservative credentials against two other candidates for the GOP nomination in 2012, let’s step back in time. Before becoming President George W. Bush’s health and human services secretary in 2001, Thompson served for 14 years as Wisconsin’s governor. One of his signature accomplishments was "Wisconsin Works -- W2," a measure he signed in to law in 1996. Thompson’s Senate campaign spokesman, Darrin Schmitz, cited W-2 as the primary evidence to back Thompson’s claim. A booklet on W-2 produced by the Thompson administration at the time hailed the law as "the end of welfare," saying it eliminated "automatic welfare checks" provided by the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. For decades, AFDC’s cash entitlement to low-income families, which sometimes lasted for many years, was synonymous with "welfare" in America. AFDC included virtually no work requirements, but W-2 not only requires recipients to work, or engage in work-related activity such as training, it puts a five-year limit on how long they can be in the program. There are several types of W-2 assistance. Some recipients, for example, work in private-sector "trial jobs" that pay at least minimum wage and are intended to become permanent, while others earn up to $673 per month working in community service jobs. In October 2011, the number of people in W-2, which is budgeted to cost $626 million in state and federal funds in 2010-2011, was nearly 16,000 -- up 15 percent from a year earlier. So, Thompson replaced the AFDC entitlement with the work-required W-2 -- but does that mean he ended welfare, period? The definition of welfare is key. Thompson "had a leading role in ending welfare as we previously knew it," said Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a liberal think tank. "Whether he eliminated welfare altogether is a matter of semantics. If by welfare, one means an entitlement program that doesn’t require work, then I think one can say that (Thompson) played a leading role in the effort to eliminate welfare. If one uses a more expansive definition, equating welfare with public assistance generally or with any form of cash assistance, then it’s not accurate to say it was eliminated." New York University professor of politics Lawrence Mead, who has done a number of studies on W-2, agreed. "If welfare means the old system, then he’s right, he did indeed abolish it," Mead said of Thompson, noting Wisconsin was the first state to create an "all-work-based" aid system. But "it’s not true in a more literal sense," Mead said, because other forms of welfare -- such as food stamps -- still exist. For instance, in October 2011, more than 800,000 low-income Wisconsin adults and children participated in FoodShare, Wisconsin’s version of what used to be known as the food stamps program. Moreover, despite its strict work requirements, W-2 arguably has its own welfare components. For example, the custodial parent of an infant who is 12 weeks old or less receives $673 per month and is not required to work. That is, to be sure, a small group and a limited time. Our conclusion Thompson declared that as governor, "we ended welfare." His W-2 program didn’t eliminate every program that might be considered a handout. But it did end the entitlement program most commonly known as welfare, replacing it with one that requires nearly all recipients to work for their benefits. We rate Thompson’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-09686	"In the health care bill, we're now offering insurance for dogs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/12/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-claims-health-care-bill-includes-insura/	We're months into this health care debate and frankly a lot of the claims we've been fact-checking from opponents and proponents alike have gotten a little stale. So we were thrilled to hear a new one on the Glenn Beck radio program on Nov. 12, 2009: "Do you know in the health care bill, we're now offering insurance for dogs," Beck said. "Do I need to say any more?" Actually yes. Keep going. "If you are somebody who is like, 'Well, I just, I'm struggling and we're barely making ends meet,' I'm not paying for your dog cardiologist!" Beck said. "Not gonna do it. I'm sorry, the dog goes nighty night." There was some discussion between Beck and his executive producer about their own dogs' medical issues, whether or not they have pet insurance, and whether the Obama administration is putting animals on par with humans. Like so many claims in the health care debate, Beck has taken a kernel of something in the bill and spun it to an absurd conclusion. Included in the House bill is the creation of a Public Health Workforce Corps to address shortages in the public health workforce. The program would provide scholarships and education loan repayment assistance for public health professionals serving in areas of need. Veterinarians are included among those public health professionals. "The rationale is that with mad cow disease, swine flu and other animal-borne diseases and issues, there is logic in helping to create more and better trained individuals to treat animal health," said Vincent Morris, spokesman for the House Rules Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. But the inclusion of veterinarians in the health bill didn't sit well with Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., who noted on the House floor on Nov. 7, 2009, that the loan repayment program will cost $283 million over five years. "So the real question I have for you folks (Democrats): Why are veterinarians part of this health care bill?" Stearns asked. Rep. Slaughter responded: "Have you ever heard of swine flu? Have you ever heard about food safety? Have you ever heard that 70 percent of all of the antibiotics produced in the United States are given to cattle and poultry even though they are not ill? But swine flu should make you worry a little bit, don’t you think?" The bill also would provide funding for fellowships to support public health training, and again, veterinary medicine is included in the mix. Lastly, the bill would create an advisory committee to assess the health workforce and to make recommendations to ensure that workforce is meeting the nation’s needs. The bill says that would include public health professions "including veterinarians engaged in public health practice." In other words, not the local vet who gives your dog heartworm pills. Two other things about the scholarships and loan assistance programs. In order to qualify, the bill says applicants must "have demonstrated expertise in public health" and as quid pro quo must serve for a period equal to their scholarship in a public health program assigned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Again, not your pet vet down the street. "Veterinarians are a part of the public health workforce, especially those that deal with disease outbreak," said Brian Cook, press secretary for Pete Stark, D-Calif., chair of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee. "We have a shortage of veterinarians right now who are trained to deal with disease outbreak." Still, scholarships, loan assistance and fellowships to veterinarians is one thing. Providing government health insurance to dogs is quite another. "We are not offering insurance for dogs," Morris said. We pored over the bill and came to the same conclusion. There is no health insurance of any kind for dogs -- no public option for Rex, no death panels for Fido. So we've got to put Beck in the doghouse for this one -- Pants on Fire!

pomt-11864	"Under Gov. (Rick) Scott’s leadership, Florida has had much success in lowering the rate of uninsured children."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/nov/02/florida-agency-health-care-administration/ahca-oversells-gov-scotts-role-reducing-number-uni/	The vast disruption of Hurricane Irma meant many families risked losing their children’s health insurance coverage due to missed payments. As the board for the state’s children’s health insurance program prepared to meet about this issue, the Agency for Health Care Administration defended Gov. Rick Scott’s record on insuring children. The agency sent out a news release with comment from Secretary Justin Senior before the meeting of Florida Healthy Kids, which operates the KidCare insurance program that provides coverage for children ages 5 through 18. Members discussed the possibility of asking the federal government for a waiver to assist families financially burdened by Hurricane Irma but ended up postponing a decision. Through the agency, the Scott administration said it would work to ensure no children lose their insurance coverage as a result of the hurricane, touting its history of getting kids insured. "Under Gov. Scott’s leadership, Florida has had much success in lowering the rate of uninsured children," the Oct. 25 news release said. We wondered if it was fair for the administration to give Scott credit for decreases in the rate of uninsured children, given his general record against public health care expansion. What does the report say? The agency cited a September 2017 Georgetown Health Policy Institute Center for Children and Families study about children’s health coverage in Florida. According to the report, the uninsured rate has been dropping since before Scott took office in 2011. Florida cut the rate of uninsured children by more than half since 2009. The rate dropped from 14.8 percent in 2009 to 6.2 percent in 2016. That’s a reduction from 601,000 uninsured children to 257,000. There are four sources of public coverage in Florida: the largest is Medicaid (2.2 million), followed by the Children's Health Insurance Program (almost 196,000), CHIP-funded Medicaid (about 145,000) and the federal heath care exchange (about 121,000). What happened? The report says Florida’s progress is "largely a result of public coverage eligibility expansions and improvements for children through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program that began decades ago." In addition, the report also gives credit to the Affordable Care Act signed by President Barack Obama. Its implementation "solidified the gains" and "accelerated the positive trend for children." Scott was a persistent critic of Obamacare and flip-flopped on whether to expand the state’s Medicaid eligibility pool under the federal law. Scott’s most recent position in 2015 suggested the state Legislature should not expand Medicaid, saying it would be "hard to understand how the state could take on even more federal programs." How the health care law helps kids get insurance Mallory McManus, a spokeswoman for the health care agency, said "the ACA actually did not alter or expand coverages for children." She noted that Florida, under Scott, reduced its children’s uninsurance rate faster than every other state but one — faster than roughly 30 expansion states. McManus pointed to two strategies to reduce uninsurance taken by the Scott administration: improving the economy and reducing unemployment; and getting kids enrolled in Medicaid who are already eligible for the program — before they get sick or go to the emergency room. But health care experts — including the author of the report the agency cited — all said the federal law likely lowered the rate of uninsured children in Florida. While Medicaid and CHIP eligibility were not technically expanded for children under the ACA, health policy experts said they expected that children would gain coverage due to the new marketplaces, outreach efforts, and the expansion of coverage to parents. "I think the Affordable Care Act has much more to do with decreasing Florida’s uninsured rate than any actions that have come out of the Legislature and governor’s office," said Anne Swerlick, a health policy expert at the Florida Policy Institute, a nonprofit that examines how policy affects the economy. (Swerlick said the the Florida Legislature did implement a provision allowing lawfully residing immigrant children to enroll in Medicaid and CHIP without waiting five years, which the Georgetown study includes.) Joan Alker, who co-authored the Georgetown study, said the ACA has clearly contributed to a sharp decline in the percent of uninsured children in Florida and nationwide. (Chart via Georgtown study) In 2013, the year before the the federal health care law was implemented, Florida’s uninsured rate for children was 11.1 percent, and by 2016 it had fallen considerable to 6.2 percent, she said. "The fact that the recent decline in the uninsured rate for Florida children began abruptly in 2014 and coincided with a decline in the uninsured rate among children nationwide is consistent with that view," said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program. One way the health care law might have helped, which Alker and Fiedler both mentioned, was the "welcome mat" effect. "In general, the outreach efforts and new coverage opportunities of the ACA created a ‘welcome mat’ for children who were already eligible for Medicaid and CHIP but not enrolled," Alker said. The ACA also increased the availability of subsidized coverage on the federal health insurance exchange, Fiedler said. He said that children with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid or CHIP are eligible for subsidized coverage through the federal marketplace. As the Georgetown report states, Florida kids are only eligible for Medicaid or CHIP if family income is below 215 percent of the federal poverty level. By contrast, subsidized Marketplace coverage is available to families with incomes as high as 400 percent of the federal poverty level, Fiedler said. And had Florida decided to expand Medicaid under the ACA, experts said that the expansion would likely improve the state’s child uninsured rate because research has shown that when parents are covered more children get covered. For example, the Urban Institute found larger increases in children getting insurance in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA, which was also documented in a study that found that Medicaid expansion to parents had a measurable "welcome mat" effect on their kids. Our ruling The state health care agency said, "Under Gov. Scott’s leadership, Florida has had much success in lowering the rate of uninsured children." The rate of uninsured children has declined dramatically since 2011. But the decline really was in the works since before Scott’s term, in 2009. Also, this claim leaves out important context in the report as to why there’s been a decline. The report credits the decline to decades of improvements for children in Medicaid and CHIP that have been in the works long before Scott took office. The report also said that the ACA solidified the state’s gain, which Scott opposed. This statement is partially accurate, but gives too much credit to Scott. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-12582	Two options for a new train station site in Buffalo are at Canalside	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2017/apr/09/brian-higgins/remaining-train-station-options-buffalo-are-not-ca/	Four locations remain under consideration for a new train station in Buffalo. Rep. Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo, wants the new station at the Central Terminal, an abandoned art deco marvel 2.5 miles east of downtown Buffalo. The Central Terminal was Buffalo’s main passenger station for 50 years until Amtrak pulled out in 1979. Higgins says the downtown Canalside location is a bad place for a train station. "While I have argued here that Central Terminal is actually preferable from an affordability standpoint to the Canalside options, I have not wavered in my view that this important decision should not be reduced to a matter of mere dollars-and-cents," Higgins said. "The Central Terminal alternative meets those two objectives in a way that Canalside never can." Higgins has referred to two of the downtown options as Canalside locations in press releases on his website. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown’s staff says Higgins is misleading the committee and the public by saying two of the four proposed locations are at Canalside. "We have been trying to clarify all along that the sites we are looking at now are not at Canalside," Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told The Buffalo News. "They are all downtown." So, who’s right? Where exactly are the options for a new train station? Downtown vs. Canalside Look at a map, and the Canalside and downtown sites are only a block or two apart on the railroad tracks -- hardly far enough to warrant such a dispute. Higgins says he uses definitions from a consultant’s report, which identified Canalside East and Canalside West as two possible locations. "The report made public by the consultants on March 21 identifies two of the three locations as Canalside East and Canalside West," Higgins said in a statement. The Canalside West location in the report is where the Memorial Auditorium once stood. That option now appears to be off the table after an engineer determined it would be difficult to accommodate the city’s bus service at the location. The three remaining downtown options are within a few blocks of the old Aud site but are generally considered beyond the boundaries of Canalside: • The site of the current station on Exchange Street, less than a quarter mile off Washington Street downtown. The footprint would have another entrance at Washington Street. • Closer to Washington Street on Exchange Street. A second entry would be built between Washington Street and Main Street, across the light rail tracks from the old Aud site. • By the on-ramp to the I-190, across from the Courtyard Marriott. The consultants' report labeled this option Canalside East. It would be on the other side of the tracks from where the current Exchange Street station and closer to Washington Street. Part of that location is now a parking lot. Behind the spat Higgins’ aides argue that the downtown locations would cut down on parking options for people who want to visit downtown Buffalo. That would hurt businesses and restaurants in a district where the state has spent millions to redevelop. Tim Tielman, who wants to preserve the Central Terminal but also supports a downtown train station, disputes that. "The congressman keeps on reiterating that if a train station goes down there it will wreak havoc with things going on at Canalside," Tielman said. "No. 1, I’d like to indicate that the trains are already there. "The entire purpose of any urban development is to attract people and, of course, the most efficient way to attract people is through public transit," said Tielman, executive director of The Campaign for Greater Buffalo. Our ruling Higgins said in press releases on his website and in a memo to the Train Station Site Selection Committee that at least two options for a new train station in Buffalo are at Canalside. Imprecision in the consultant’s report added to the confusion because only one of the two possible sites labeled as "Canalside" locations in the report is actually within Canalside boundaries. None of the options now being considered is at Canalside. Two of the options have entries across the street from Canalside to give passengers easier access to the city’s public transit system. That’s close to Canalside, but not in the district. Higgins’ claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03178	Under the Endangered Species Act, "only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/03/cynthia-lummis/endangered-species-act-percent-taken-off-list/	The Endangered Species Act, the law that protects animals and plants at risk of extinction, has had some dramatic successes -- among them, saving the bald eagle, the gray whale, the peregrine falcon and the American alligator. But the law has also drawn complaints from landowners and energy interests that it unnecessarily harms economic development. The debate over the decades-old law is resurfacing in Congress, with critics of the law citing a statistic that raises questions about the law’s effectiveness. Specifically, a reader suggested we check a claim by U.S. Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., in a recent interview with Wyoming Public Radio. In the interview, which aired Aug. 23, 2013, Lummis said, "Our goal is not to repeal the Endangered Species Act. Far from it. Our goal is to make the Endangered Species Act work. We have a law where only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted. To me, that indicates a law that is failing in its ultimate goal which is to list species, recover them, and then delist them." Whether the act is "failing" is an opinion, and as we'll see, opinions differ on that point. We wanted to concentrate on whether Lummis is right that under the act, "only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted." How does the act work? The precursor to the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1966. The law was revised in 1969 and underwent a major rewrite in 1973. A key element of the 1973 act is that it prohibits federal agencies from "authorizing, funding, or carrying out any action that would jeopardize a listed species or destroy or modify its ‘critical habitat.’ " While this doesn’t necessarily affect privately held land, many major development projects on private land may require one or more federal permits, so they can be delayed or otherwise affected by the law. In addition, states may have their own laws on endangered species. So what does "listing" mean? The federal government can confer protection upon species after completing a lengthy regulatory process that includes public input. The factors that would qualify a species for the list, according to the 1973 act, include "the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; disease or predation; the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence." The two key categories are "endangered" and "threatened." An endangered species is at more severe risk than a threatened species; a species can be either "uplisted" from threatened to endangered or "downlisted" from endangered to threatened, depending on the improvement of its prognosis in the wild. Species can also be "delisted" entirely. That can be done if the threats to the species "have been eliminated or controlled, based on several factors including population sizes and trends and the stability of habitat quality and quantity." How many species have been delisted? The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, one of the key agencies that carries out the act’s provisions, has a running tally of species that have been listed and delisted. All told, 56 species have been delisted. Because Lummis said she was talking about the ability of the law to "list species, recover them, and then delist them," we will use the 28 species that were delisted due to recovery as the focus of our calculation. We will exclude the 10 that were delisted because they became extinct, and an additional 18 that were delisted for a variety of other reasons, such as an error in the original listing. Meanwhile, 2,105 species have been listed as either threatened or endangered. So, doing the math, 1.3 percent of listed species have ultimately been delisted.. In other words, numerically, Lummis is right -- slightly more than 1 percent of listed species have been taken off the list because they recovered. Is this the only purpose of the act? Experts say that while Lummis was right on the number, they add that the number tells only part of the story. They argue that while delisting is great, it isn’t the primary goal of the law. At root, they say, the law is designed to prevent extinction -- and on that score, the law has been a success. Only one-half of 1 percent of species placed on the list have become extinct, which works out to a success rate of over 99 percent plus. "By the time species are listed as threatened or endangered, their numbers are so low that preventing extinction is the major challenge, with recovery and delisting a remote consideration," said Wm. Robert Irvin, president and CEO of the advocacy group American Rivers. "The law acts as an emergency room. Recovery requires much longer treatment through actions under the full panoply of conservation laws and programs." In addition, focusing on delisting ignores species that have seen improvements in viability, but not large enough to justify a delisting. This has been the case for a variety of species, from sea otters to black-footed ferrets. J. Michael Scott, an emeritus professor in the fish and wildlife department of the University of Idaho, said studies suggest that more than half of the endangered and threatened populations are stable or improving, and that percentage increases with the length of time the species has been protected. Such statistics "suggest that the act is far more successful than the 1 percent figure suggests," he said. Our ruling Lummis said that under the Endangered Species Act, "only 1 percent of the species that have been listed have actually been delisted." She’s correct, though one could just as easily say that less than 1 percent of the species placed on the list have become extinct, and that many species have improved without being delisted. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Cynthia Lummis	None	None	None	2013-09-03T16:38:18	2013-08-23	['None']

pomt-14338	Congress will begin its recess "without having allocated one penny" to fight Zika.	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/mar/25/hillary-clinton/clinton-congress-hasnt-allocated-one-penny-fight-z/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton stepped into the Zika funding debate and chastised Congress for failing to step up to the plate. "Congress should meet President (Barack) Obama’s request for $1.8 billion in emergency appropriations to fight Zika," Clinton said March 18, 2016 on Medium. "The president asked for this funding over a month ago, but on Saturday, Congress will begin a two-week break without having allocated one penny." Clinton went on to note that "Congressional Republicans said the administration should use funds left over from fighting Ebola — even though that money is still being used. Why would we lower our defenses against one public health threat in order to meet another one? That’s senseless and dangerous. Congress needs to provide the funds to fight Zika now." We were curious whether Congress recessed without "allocating a single penny" to deal with the Zika virus. The Zika virus has spread rapidly in South America and is making inroads in the United States, mostly in Puerto Rico, but in many mainland states as well. The mosquito-borne disease has been linked to birth defects and neurological disorders. On Feb. 8, Obama asked Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to expand mosquito control programs in the states, accelerate vaccine research and take a number of other steps to rein in the disease. By the budget rules in Washington, emergency funding is not controlled by the deficit reduction spending caps that apply to most programs. At first, Republicans sounded receptive. A few days after the administration’s request, House Speaker Paul Ryan said "we do anticipate some kind of bipartisan action on this, because this is something we want to get ahead of." On Feb. 18, the GOP chair of the House Appropriations Committee, joined by two Republican subcommittee chairs, told the White House Office of Management and Budget that before it asked for new money, it should use dollars left over from the emergency response provided to fight Ebola. "If the aim of the request is to mount as rapid a response as possible, it is clear to us that the most expeditious way to identify the needed funding is to maximize the use of unobligated funds previously provided for Ebola response, prevention, and preparedness." The House Republicans said they estimated that $2.7 billion remained unused out of the original $5.4 billion emergency appropriation. They noted that under the rules of the emergency appropriation, about $400 million of those funds need to be spent by the end of September. We’ll dig a little deeper into that Ebola money in a moment, but to settle one piece of this fact-check, in terms of committing new dollars explicitly to combat the Zika virus, Congress has not done that. The remaining Ebola money Jennifer Kates, director of the Kaiser Family Foundation’s program on global health and HIV policy, tracks Washington spending in this area about as closely as anyone. Kates told us that the Republican number might be a bit high, but by her latest count, about $2.4 billion of Ebola funding remains. So in theory, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department’s Agency for International Development (USAID) could redirect some of that money to fight Zika. But there are some issues to unpack. First, Congress appropriated many of those dollars to be spent over a period of five years. For example, the funding bill gave the CDC over $1.7 billion with the broad instruction to "prevent, prepare for, and respond to Ebola domestically and internationally." "Initially, they recognized that part of the job involved building the health care systems over time," Kates said. "They wanted the tools to be in place so we could be on top of things when another outbreak took place. And we know there will be other outbreaks, of Ebola or something else." There are plenty of examples of lawmakers, both Republican and Democratic, talking about the Ebola money as a longer term investment. Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a high-ranking subcommittee chair on the appropriations committee, held a hearing in April 2015 to review the impact of the emergency funding. Cole opened the hearing saying he wanted to discuss "the lessons learned from this outbreak and how the funding Congress provided will support longer term public health capacity." At another appropriations subcommittee hearing in February 2015, Dirk Dijkerman, USAID’s coordinator for its Ebola Task Force described how his agency was using the money as the immediate Ebola threat eased. "We are focusing on building more resilient health and prepared systems in West Africa, in other hot spots in Africa," Dijkerman said. "Our goal is to detect, prevent and respond to future outbreaks before they become global security threats." So while one could make the case that the emergency Ebola money was intended to be used for a future outbreak, much of the discussion was not about putting out fires, but about building health care infrastructure. CDC director Thomas Frieden told the House Appropriations Committee on March 23, 2016, that while his agency was working hard to tackle the Zika virus, "we will not be able to do so without the resources requested in the administration's FY 2016 emergency supplemental request." "If you look at the definition of emergency -- unanticipated, potentially catastrophic, permanent damage -- I can't imagine a situation that meets this more than Zika," Frieden said. "There has never before been a mosquito borne illness that can cause a birth defect; we've never seen that before." Frieden said all of the dollars Congress had allocated before were for specific activities. While he could move dollars around, he warned that there would be trade-offs. Kates said a long-running debate in Washington lies behind this current tug-of-war. "We have an episodic response to these things," Kates said. "There's an interest in having a steady stream of funding to build up the systems we'd need to respond to new outbreaks, but that doesn't seem to be the way things are done." Our ruling Clinton said that Congress had not "allocated one penny" to fight Zika. In terms of targeting new dollars to deal with the Zika virus, that is correct. House Republicans say that they did provide money through the emergency Ebola appropriation. To the extent that those funds could be redirected, that holds up. But it is also true that when that money was approved there was a bipartisan agreement that it would be used for longer term efforts to build overall health care system capacity. There is a policy disagreement on the best way to deploy federal funds -- and we're not weighing in on that here. But regardless, there is no new money to confront Zika. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-03-25T11:10:59	2016-03-18	['None']
pomt-01174	"The pass rate for a high school level test to join the military" is 35 to 40 percent.	false	/florida/statements/2014/dec/09/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-only-35-40-percent-pass-military-ent/	Common Core’s Republican defender-in-chief, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has been known to marshal a varied portfolio of evidence to show that the United States need to raise its education standards. In a question-and-answer session at a Wall Street Journal event on Dec. 1, Bush told attendees that a majority of high school graduates aren’t ready for college or work. He added that our educational schools are also a problem for the military. "In the video beforehand," Bush said, Gen. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "talked about 25 percent pass rate. Now, that's not just because of the test. That's also because of obesity and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. And these are abysmal numbers. (These are) horrific numbers. And yet, there's no one marching in the streets. There's no one saying, you know, ‘The end is near because of this.’ But the fact is, the end is near if we can't fix this." Bush is correct that obesity and tattoos keep out some applicants. But do only 35 to 40 percent of applicants for the military pass the test? Military entrance exam We’ll note right off the bat that Bush is wrong because he flubbed this talking point. Bush’s spokeswoman Jaryn Emhof told PolitiFact that Bush had meant to say that about one-third fail the test rather than pass it. In fact, she added, just a month earlier, Bush gave an education summit speech in which he said, "Almost a third of high school graduates fail the military entrance exam." We applaud Bush’s team for acknowledging his error, but the topic is an interesting one, so we’ll proceed by continuing to address the facts behind the claim. We were unable to find a single, definitive source of data to show what percentage of applicants pass or fail the exam. This is partly because each branch of the military sets its own acceptance rate. Applicants for the military take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB. A subset of the tests are combined to compute a score that is used to determine eligibility. This is called the Armed Forces Qualification Test, or AFQT. It tests applicants’ verbal and math abilities, among other areas. For the military, the largest single disqualifying factor is health, including such problems as obesity. The estimate for those who are disqualified only because of aptitude is about 2 percent, said Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman. That includes not just people who failed the test but also those with other academic deficiencies, such as failure to get a GED. However, this number does not tell the full story, since it doesn’t account for those who are ineligible for more than one reason -- for example, failing the test and being obese. By law, the military can process any applicant who scores in the 10th percentile or higher, although individual services set their cut-offs somewhat higher, typically in the 30 percentile range or higher. We tried to get data from the service branches regarding what percentage failed the test based on the minimum score they accept and were unable to do so. The Army referred us back to the Defense Department. We were unable to get additional details from the Navy. A spokesman for the Marines said that they don’t track data for potential applicants who are disqualified. "The short answer is that 31 is the minimum score required for an applicant to enlist into the Marine Corps without incurring greater scrutiny," Marines spokesman Sgt. Bryce Piper said, referring to scores in the 31st percentile or higher. Applicants who score 21-30 can still enlist if they pass an additional review and don’t require waivers due to any other issues. However, we found a couple studies that looked at the failure rate of test takers. The most specific was was a 2010 study by The Education Trust, an entity focused on improving educational achievement. Researchers looked at nearly 350,000 high school graduates between the ages of 17 and 20 who applied for entry to the Army between 2004 and 2009. That means the sample included recent high school graduates who had already been screened out for other disqualifying factors. The study found that about 23 percent failed to achieve the qualifying score. We asked a spokeswoman for Bush if that study was his source and she told us that it was, as well as a 2009 paper written by Mission Readiness, a group of retired military officials. That paper cited a 30 percent test-taker failure rate for the Army (though it attributed that information to an Army official without providing any further details). A Mission Readiness spokesman said his organization now relies on the Education Trust figure. Meanwhile, a 2009 paper by the Rand Corp. found that the passage rate varied widely when broken down by race and service branch. For example, about 70 percent of whites passed the test for the Air Force, while the figure was closer to 40 percent for Hispanics and blacks. The test isn’t the biggest hurdle, said Beth Asch, senior economist at Rand and one of the paper’s authors. "The real issue is weight and high school diploma," she told PolitiFact. Our ruling Bush said that "the pass rate for a high school level test to join the military is 35 to 40 percent." A Bush spokeswoman said he meant to say that one-third failed the test, a rate that is roughly in line with one credible measure of applicants to the Army (though the available data is scattered and incomplete). Still, what Bush said was incorrect, so we rate it False.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2014-12-09T15:22:23	2014-12-01	['None']
pomt-04981	The Pasco County budget "has doubled in the past three years."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/22/rachel-oconnor/rachel-oconnor-says-pascos-budget-has-doubled-thre/	Rachel O’Connor is running against three-term incumbent Pasco County commissioner Ted Schrader and another well-financed businessman, Ron Oakley. So, the University of South Florida graduate student and Republican activist is trying to use her conservative message to stand out from the pack. During a recent interview with an editorial writer and reporter from the Times, O’Connor said she brings a different perspective to Pasco’s problems. One problem? Excessive spending, she said, casting Pasco County’s budget in stark terms. "Our budget has doubled in the past three years," she said, echoing a claim she made at a recent candidate forum. "I think we need to prioritize spending." The claim prompted a double take. Here’s what happened next: Editorial writer C.T. Bowen: "I’ve got to back you up. The budget’s doubled the last three years?" O’Connor: "Yeah." Bowen: "How’s that possible?" O’Connor: "It’s possible. I talked to Mr. Nurrenbrock (the county’s longtime budget chief). You can double-check it with him. It has. In the past three years. It’s now over $1 billion." Reporter Lee Logan: "Um, there must be… I guess… That’s not the general revenue portion of the budget?" O’Connor: "That’s the total budget." Clearly there’s something funky going on here. So we called budget chief Mike Nurrenbrock. He pointed us to the budget’s final summary page. Sure enough, under "total county budget," it includes $554 million for Fiscal Year 2011, $1.1 billion for Fiscal Year 2012, and $1.1 billion for the proposed budget that begins Oct. 1. But Nurrenbrock explained that line doesn’t exactly compare apples to apples. Here’s the key: the FY2011 figure lists what was actually spent that year. The next two numbers are the total budget, even though officials know a good chunk of the money won’t be spent that year. Nurrenbrock said that "dramatic difference" is money that is rolled from each year to the next. That includes reserves, large capital projects and money for bond issues. "There’s a major portion of our budget that just goes forward the next year, pretty much every year," he said. Some high-profile examples: The county has $32 million in general fund reserves in case a major storm hits, and there is a similar $5 million pot in the municipal service fund. About $11.5 million in tourism taxes have been collecting for 20 years, and commissioners recently earmarked the money for a sports complex in Wesley Chapel. There is a $7 million fund for economic development incentives or infrastructure. And there’s a total of $93 million in transportation impact fees. Those are set aside for specific projects that simply haven’t gone out to bid. That figure includes about $40 million for the long-stalled Ridge Road extension. And so on. Nurrenbrock said it’s more accurate to compare the total spending plans from each year. Here are the last five bottom-line budgets: $980 million (FY09), $949 million (FY10), $1.03 billion (FY11), $1.09 billion (FY 12), and next year’s proposed $1.1 billion. O’Connor acknowledged the mistake. She said it stems from trying to make sense of a complex, 292-page spending plan. Challengers are often at a disadvantage to incumbents regarding budgetary details, because sitting commissioners are supposed to know how the county’s money is spent. "As candidates, it’s very difficult to look at that budget and come up with specific things to cut," she said. "When you try to get insight with the county administration, they’re not the easiest to work with." Fair enough. Also, O’Connor isn’t the only candidate to make a wild claim about Pasco’s spending. District 3 hopeful Kathryn Starkey recently retracted a line about reining in "runaway local government spending" that was on her campaign flier. In an interview, she said, "All in all, I think our county government has done a good job of being fiscally conservative in a tough time." But O’Connor’s claim about a ballooning county budget is shocking — especially as property tax collections have shriveled in the past several years. The claim is also incorrect. O’Connor’s statement earns a False.	None	Rachel O'Connor	None	None	None	2012-07-22T10:00:00	2012-07-12	['None']
pomt-07653	"Seven of the 10" school districts with the lowest graduation rate for African-American boys in the country are in Florida.	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/14/steve-wise/explaining-graduation-gap-between-african-american/	One of the attacks against SB 736 -- the controversial teacher tenure and merit pay proposal that passed the state Senate on March 10, 2011 -- is that the bill is attempting to make sweeping changes to an education system that doesn't need it. Florida's education system, after all, was just ranked fifth in the nation by Education Week. But state Sen. Stephen Wise, R-Jacksonville, SB 736's prime sponsor, said the ranking shouldn't stop the state from pursuing major education reforms. "We're doing a great job. Yeah, we're fifth in the country," Wise said in passionate comments on the Senate floor shortly before the bill passed 26-12. "We're doing a great job. We've got great graduation rates. "That's if you get there," he said. "The dirty little secret we don't talk about is, where are the black boys? It's awful, it's absolutely pathetic what the graduation rate is for African-American boys. ... We have seven of the 10 worst school districts in America on graduation of black boys. We've kept it a secret." PolitiFact Florida wanted to pull back the curtain on Wise's claim. Wise told us the figure came from a 2010 report released by the Massachusetts-based Schott Foundation for Public Education. The report attempted to calculate the percentage at which African-American males are graduating high school compared to other students. The foundation examined 2007-08 data from 59 large school districts across the country with African-American student populations of at least 10,000. Michael Holzman, a research consultant for the Schott Foundation, told the St. Petersburg Times he simply divided the number of standard diplomas awarded in 2008 by the number of students who entered high school four years earlier. The calculation does not include people who obtained a GED. The Schott Foundation then compared the performance of black males to white males. Nationwide, 47 percent of black males graduated high school compared with 78 percent of white males. In Florida just 37 percent of black males graduated compared with 57 percent of white males. Going district-by-district, Florida results appeared even worse, the Schott Foundation found. The three lowest African-American graduation rates among the 59 districts examined were all in Florida -- Pinellas County graduated 21 percent of its African-American students, Palm Beach County 22 percent and Duval County 23 percent. A fourth Florida district, Miami-Dade, had the seventh-lowest graduation rate, according to the Schott analysis. The other low-performing districts are from outside Florida -- Philadelphia, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Charleston County in South Carolina and Jefferson Parish in Louisiana. That's four out of 10, more than any other state, but not the seven of 10 Wise claimed on the Senate floor. For the record, Pinellas officials criticized the Schott report, saying that the formula it used was oversimplified, and, among other shortcomings, did not account for students who transferred away from the district. Pinellas school officials said the rate for black male graduations was 47.3 percent in 2008 and rose to 57.5 percent in 2009 after also including students who move into GED or adult education courses. That's an additional caveat to Wise's claim that Florida is home to seven of the 10 worst school districts in America when it comes to graduation rates for African-American males. In judging his statement, however, let's remember the context. Wise was attempting to show that problems remain with Florida's public education system by highlighting the poor track record some Florida school districts have when it comes to graduating African-American males. He said specifically that seven of the 10 worst school districts are in Florida. It turns out he got the number wrong, and some districts have criticized the specific study and its findings. But the Schott study, at the least, is an apples-to-apples comparison of school district performance. Maybe Pinellas' graduation rate number should be higher. But in that case, so should Cleveland's. And so on. "'No matter what it is, it's terrible," Wise said. Wise's number is a bit shaky, but we're giving him credit for his point. To us, that rates Half True.

pomt-10199	John McCain said last year he didn't know of a solution to the mortgage crisis.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/16/barack-obama/mccain-said-he-had-confidence-in-paulson/	Barack Obama promoted his record on the economy and attacked John McCain's policies in a speech in Golden, Colo., on Sept. 16, 2008, the day after the stock market reeled on news of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. "Last September, I stood up at Nasdaq and said it's time to realize that we are in this together — that there is no dividing line between Wall Street and Main Street — and warned of a growing loss of trust in our capital markets," Obama said. "Months later, Sen. McCain told a newspaper that he'd love to give them a solution to the mortgage crisis, 'but' — he said — 'I don't know one.'" Obama did give a speech at Nasdaq on Sept. 17, 2007, in which he talked about the mortgage crisis and how it could affect both homeowners and Wall Street. He proposed several ways that the government could regulate markets more effectively. So that part of his statement is true. We wanted to know if McCain said that he "didn't know" of a solution to the mortgage crisis, as Obama said, and to see if McCain's remarks were taken in context. The source for that claim is a videotaped interview McCain gave to the Keene (N.H.) Sentinel on Dec. 4, 2007. In McCain's defense, it should be noted that at that time, the larger topic of debate was how to help homeowners losing their homes to foreclosure. The crisis in the financial industry then was a lesser, though still serious, concern. When McCain was speaking with the Sentinel board, the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns was still more than four months in the future. In the interview, McCain disparaged speculators who contributed to bad loans, but his comments focused on how to help homeowners meet their house payments and stay out of foreclosure. McCain specifically mentioned creating a simplified form for mortgages so loan applicants could more easily understand the terms of their mortgages. "In an ideal world, we'd have enough people to go case-by-case and say, okay, you can go back to your previous interest rate, and you can't," McCain said. "But, my God, we're talking about hundreds of thousands, if not millions (of homeowners) and how long would that take? Meanwhile, people are suffering very badly." "I don't know how bad it's going to get, and obviously the worse it gets, then, the more there is a role for goverment," McCain added. "But I can't come down yet and give you a specific solution, because I don't claim to be smart enough, but I do have some confidence in (Treasury Secretary Henry) Paulson and I'm glad to see him more and more active in this issue. I'd love to give you a solution, but I don't know." He also said he he relies on his advisers and other "smart people" to keep him up to speed on economic matters. Let's stipulate that this interview does not showcase McCain at his best on issues of the economy and finance. But Obama's statement that McCain said he "didn't know" of a solution to the mortgage crisis appears to be accurate given the full context of the interview. We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-02399	Says five Democratic state senators were for her bicycle tailgating bill "before they were against it."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/mar/10/barbara-comstock/barabara-comstock-says-democrats-flip-flopped-bicy/	Republican Del. Barbara Comstock says five U-turning Democrats ran over her bicycle safety bill in the state Senate last month. Comstock, who represents Fairfax County and is running for the 10th District congressional seat being vacated by Republican Frank Wolf, complained on her campaign’s Facebook page. "Democrat senators were for my bipartisan ‘following too closely’ bicycle bill (HB 82) before they were against it!" she wrote on Feb. 21. "It was the same bill that Democrat senators voted for last year but this year, after I got it through the House (unlike the previous House patron) the senate killed it! Welcome to the new Democrat-controlled Virginia Senate." Comstock was referring to the Senate Transportation Committee’s 9-5 vote on Feb. 19 to kill her bill that would have made it illegal for a motorist to tailgate a bicycle. Two of Comstock’s political supporters posted Facebook replies accusing the Democrats of switching to undermine Comstock in her congressional race. A third supporter urged to her reveal the flip floppers. So Comstock posted the names of five Democrats: Sens. Creigh Deeds of Bath County, Henry Marsh of Richmond, Ken Alexander of Norfolk, Phil Puckett of Russell County and John Miller of Newport News. Records show that each of the five did vote to kill the bill. So we looked into Comstock’s claim each changed his previous position. Comstock’s one-paragraph bill would have barred motorists from following bicycles "more closely than is reasonable and prudent." In recent years, bills with the same language have passed the House and Senate, but they’ve never been able to muster a majority vote from both chambers during the same year and make it to the governor’s desk. Last year, the Senate passed an anti-tailgating bill containing an additional provision that would have extended the 2-foot width motorists must allow when passing bicyclists to 3 feet. Deeds, Alexander, Puckett and Miller supported the legislation. Marsh voted against the measure. Marsh, however, did support legislation in 2012 that solely contained the tailgating provision. So did Deeds, Puckett and Miller. Alexander was not in the Senate that year and did not cast a ballot on the bill. We asked the Democrats why they changed their votes this year. Marsh and Deeds emailed that they were swayed by questions about the bill’s enforceability that were raised at a hearing last month by Sen. Charles Carrico Sr., R-Grayson. Carrico, a former state trooper, said issuing a tailgating ticket is a judgement call by police that’s tough to make stick in court unless there’s been an accident. "I do not recall hearing this discussion in past years when I voted for similar legislation," Marsh wrote. Deeds emailed, "I always reserve the right to be smarter today than I was yesterday." Alexander told us that before his vote in favor of the measure last year, he hadn’t had the benefit of sitting through a committee hearing on the law because he was new to the Senate and had not received his assignments. After hearing the committee debate this year, Alexander said he had concerns about how police would apply the "necessary and prudent" standard for following bicyclists. After voting to kill the measure on Feb. 19, Alexander asked the Transportation Committee to reconsider the bill to see if his colleagues would be willing to replace the "necessary and prudent" following distance with an exact measurement. The panel took the bill up and killed it a second time on Feb. 26, this time with Alexander voting in the minority. We reached out to Miller and Puckett about their changed votes, but didn’t hear back. It should be noted that backpedaling on bicycle tailgating bill is a bipartisan sport. Comstock’s list of Senate defectors included two Republicans who opposed tailgating legislation this year and supported it last year: Steve Newman of Lynchburg and Ralph Smith of Botetourt County. We should also note that the vote tallies were evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Of the nine senators that voted to kill the measure five were Democrats and four were Republicans. Our ruling Comstock said a group of Senate Democrats once backed the language of her bike tailgating bill but now oppose it. She correctly identified five Democrats who changed their position, leading to the defeat on her bill this year. Although Comstock directed her ire at the Democrats, she did note that two Republican senators also switched positions this year. We rate her statement True.

pomt-03701	The Manchin-Toomey amendment "would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members" to get government approval.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/18/national-rifle-association/nra-says-manchin-toomey-would-have-criminalized-so/	Not long after the Senate voted down a bipartisan effort to expand background checks on gun sales, the National Rifle Association released a statement hailing the proposal’s downfall as good news. "This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution. As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools," the pro-gun rights group said on April 17, 2013. The amendment, offered by Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, would have required background checks for private sales at gun shows and on the Internet, two areas that are currently exempt from federal law. But it specifically exempted transactions between family members from the background check requirement. So we wondered what circumstances the NRA envisioned that could have "criminalized certain private transfers of firearms." What’s in the amendment The Manchin-Toomey amendment stopped short of language in a larger Senate bill on guns, which would have mandated criminal background checks on all sales between private parties with limited exceptions. Current law requires checks on purchases only from federally licensed gun dealers. So the Manchin-Toomey amendment attempted to find middle ground -- expanding the checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. "As under current law, transfers between family, friends and neighbors do not require background checks. You can give or sell a gun to your brother, your neighbor, your co-worker without a background check. You can post a gun for sale on the cork bulletin board at your church or your job without a background check," a press release from the senators said. The amendment itself specifically said background checks wouldn’t be required of family members if "the transfer is made between spouses, between parents or spouses of parents and their children or spouses of their children, between siblings or spouses of siblings, or between grandparents or spouses of grandparents and their grandchildren or spouses of their grandchildren, or between aunts or uncles or their spouses and their nieces or nephews or their spouses, or between first cousins, if the transferor does not know or have reasonable cause to believe that the transferee is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm under Federal, State, or local law." "It’d have to be pretty distant family" for the background check rule to apply, said Chris Calabrese, legal counsel for the ACLU. As for friends buying and selling guns, no background check was required if the sale was not advertised online or in a publication. So how could such transfers be "criminalized?" The amendment required a background check for any advertised sale. So imagine these two circumstances overlapping. "If I do an advertisement that I’m looking to sell a firearm and then my friend comes and says to me, ‘I’d like to buy a gun,’ then I’d have to do a background check," Calabrese said. Same goes for a gun sold to a friend or a family member at a gun show. Calabrese said the ACLU did not oppose the Manchin-Toomey amendment because it made clear what transactions were subject to background checks. "We didn’t think anybody should inadvertently become a criminal. The criminal laws should be clear in who they apply to so people don’t have a problem understanding and following the law. We think this meets this standard," he said. John Frazer, a spokesman for the NRA, described some circumstances "in which transfers among such people could have been subject to prosecution under the amendment." He mentioned friends running into each other at a gun show, or someone posting a gun for sale on Facebook and receiving interest from a cousin. If a gun was sold in those circumstances without a background check, "the transfer would be a crime." Garen Wintemute, an expert in gun issues who favors more gun control, told PolitiFact that the amendment didn’t go so far as criminalizing private transfers. "It simply subjected them to new procedural requirements," he said in an email. Our ruling The NRA said that the Manchin-Toomey amendment would have "criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring lifelong friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution." The amendment specifically exempted family and friend transfers from the requirement to conduct a criminal background check. But it did extend the requirement to Internet and gun show sales. So only if a friend or family member purchased a gun in one of those settings would the background check requirement kick in. That’s a limited circumstance, to be sure. And as Wintemute argued, it was added a layer of paperwork but did not make familial gun transfers crimes. The NRA’s statement contained an element of truth but was otherwise a big stretch. We rate it Mostly False. Update: This report has been updated to include a comment we received from the NRA shortly after we published. The rating remains the same.

pomt-12281	The New York State Senate "passed legislation allowing minors to race snowmobiles, get their own hunting licenses, and not be employed gathering or picking rags, cigar stumps, or collecting bones."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/jun/30/samantha-bee/joke-about-bills-passed-ny-state-senate-not-joke/	State lawmakers have left Albany for the year without taking up a bill that would extend the statute of limitations for child sex abuse victims. Current law allows those victims to bring criminal charges against their alleged abuser until the age of 23. The Child Victims Act would extend the age to 28 and create a one-year revival period for past cases regardless of when they happened. Victims could also bring civil cases until age 50. The bill passed in the State Assembly with the support of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, but was blocked by Republicans in the State Senate. Comedian Samantha Bee took aim at the Senate on her weekly late-night talk show last week. "I don't want you to think the New York Senate is anti-child," Bee said. "This session they passed legislation allowing minors to race snowmobiles, get their own hunting licenses, and not be employed gathering or picking rags, cigar stumps, or collecting bones." Anyone who does not follow New York state politics closely may be surprised by the claim. Those inside what’s known as the ‘Albany bubble’ were most likely not. But Bee is known for comedy. Some may have seen her claim as satirical. Were those bills a joke, or was Bee talking about legislation that actually passed the Senate? Snowmobile racing The Senate passed a bill in March that would allow people under the age of 18 to compete in organized snowmobile racing events without a safety certificate from the state. Current law requires anyone under the age of 18 to take a state-approved safety course before they ride a snowmobile. Anyone under 14 has to also be supervised by an adult when riding. The regulations do not apply if the minor rides on land owned by their parent or guardian. The bill would throw out those rules as long as the minor is participating in a snowmobile racing event. The bill, sponsored by Republican Sen. Betty Little of the North Country, passed the 63-member Senate with 49 votes. The Assembly did not take up the bill. Looser hunting restrictions Another bill, passed by the Senate in June, would allow 12-year-olds to get a universal hunting license by lowering the age for some hunting activities. You can start hunting when you are 12 in New York, but certain restrictions remain until the hunter is 14. The bill would drop the age from 14 to 12 for someone to participate in muzzle-loading season, obtain muzzle-loading privileges, hunt with a crossbow, and hunt big game. The child would have to be supervised by a parent or youth mentor. The sponsor, Republican Joseph Griffo, says in the bill’s memo it’s intended to give parents the opportunity to teach children about hunting at a younger age. The bill passed the Senate with 53 votes. The Assembly did not take it up. Begging for money The third bill targets people who use children to panhandle on the street. It’s already illegal for someone to use a child to beg for money but the crime is under the state’s arts and cultural affairs law instead of the penal law. This bill, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeffrey Klein of the Bronx, would transfer the crime to the penal law and strengthen the penalty for repeat offenders. The bill says someone cannot ask or allow a child under 16 to beg for money or receive payment for "picking rags, or collecting cigar stumps, or collecting bones." That provision has actually been in state law since 1971. It’s part of a broader law that bans children from doing several things for money. Among the more interesting: children cannot be employed as tightrope walkers and cannot receive money for displaying a physical deformity. The Klein bill to move the crime to the penal law passed the Senate in June with 55 votes. The bill was not taken up in the Assembly. Our ruling Comedian Samantha Bee said the New York State Senate "passed legislation allowing minors to race snowmobiles, get their own hunting licenses, and not be employed gathering or picking rags, cigar stumps, or collecting bones." Each of the bills is real and passed the Senate this year. Her claim is True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Samantha Bee	None	None	None	2017-06-30T12:43:23	2017-06-21	['None']
pomt-02056	"Nathan Deal cut the HOPE scholarship program so that literally 100,000 Georgians will not be able to go to college or get technical training that they so badly needed to raise -- you know, give them a chance at a good job."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/may/30/peter-shumlin/target-deal-hope-mark/	Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, went on the attack just one day after Georgia’s primary election. Shumlin was on MSNBC promoting state Sen. Jason Carter, his party’s nominee for governor of Georgia, and pouncing on Gov. Nathan Deal, Carter’s GOP opponent. "Nathan Deal cut the HOPE scholarship program so that literally 100,000 Georgians will not be able to go to college or get technical training that they so badly needed to raise -- you know, give them a chance at a good job," Shumlin said. The HOPE scholarship program, which is funded by lottery sales, is sacrosanct in Georgia. Since the mid-1990s, HOPE has given tens of thousands of students the chance to attend a college, university or technical college. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Shumlin was correct. Did Deal slash the HOPE program to the detriment of 100,000 students? Deal pushed through several changes to HOPE in his first year in office that he said were needed to ensure its long-term viability. He took similar steps with the state’s popular universal and voluntary pre-kindergarten program, which also is funded by lottery ticket sales. The changes to HOPE, which had Republican and Democrat backing, were effective for fiscal 2012, which started July 1, 2011. For the first time, technical college students had to maintain a 3.0 grade-point average -- instead of a 2.0 -- to qualify for a HOPE grant. For all but the top students, HOPE awards were cut -- to cover about 90 percent of tuition costs (now about 80 percent). Another new requirement meant students had to start college within seven years of their high school graduation in order to receive a HOPE scholarship. The fallout was immediate. At the technical colleges, for example, the share of students receiving HOPE dropped from 74 percent in 2011 to 54 percent in 2013. They included 11,471 students who lost HOPE because their GPAs straddled between 2.0 and 3.0. A chart on the Georgia Student Finance Commission website documents what happened. It shows: -- 256,380 students were receiving scholarships and grants, totaling nearly $748 million, in 2010-2011, the year before the program was changed. -- 214,671 students received scholarship/grant awards, worth a combined $529 million, for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the first year of the changes; -- and in 2012-2013, 193,876 students were on HOPE at a cost of $501 million. The result: 62,504 fewer HOPE recipients. That’s a lot. But it’s not 100,000. So where did Shumlin get that 100,000 students who lost HOPE? We reached out to the Democratic Governors Association, where spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told us the 100,000 figure came from an Atlanta Magazine article published in January 2014. The article showed 256,392 students on HOPE in 2011 and 148,331 in the scholarship/grant program in 2014, for a difference of about 108,000. The problem: The article included data for only part of 2014. (The 2014 Fiscal Year doesn’t end until June 30, 2014.) It should be noted that, according to Tracy Ireland, president of the Student Finance Commission, the 2014 figures were omitted from the agency’s website beginning in late April due to a computer error and were not reposted until May 23, after Shumlin’s MSNBC appearance and after PolitiFact started making calls for this fact check. The agency also went back May 23 and adjusted the website report to show more grant and scholarship awards than had previously been reported. (Award totals for fiscal 2012 were changed from 202,891, as shown on the website earlier in May, to 214,671. The fiscal 2013 awards were revised from 173,723 to 193,876). The numbers were changed, in part, to include students who received the Zell Miller Scholarship in fiscal years 2012, 2013 (as well as 2014) and others who received the new Strategic Industries Workforce Development grants, Ireland said. Both the scholarship and grant are funded by HOPE. Ireland said officials previously planned to add those numbers as part of a website rewrite, but instead updated them May 23. Democrats called the revisions suspicious. "They are actively revising numbers to make the governor look better in an election year when his opponent is making this a key issue," said Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for Carter. Data on the Student Finance Commission’s website in early May showed there were 82,682 fewer HOPE scholarship/grant recipients between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2013. (The numbers are not independently audited, according to Ireland.) More to consider No one disputes that the changes to HOPE contributed to coinciding enrollment declines (Enrollment in the state’s technical colleges went from 195,366 in 2011 to 151,150 in 2013 and from 318,027 to 309,469 in the University System of Georgia in the same period.) But there’s more to know about the numbers. State officials say other factors likely played a role in the drop in HOPE awards and enrollment. Technical colleges moved during this period from quarters to semesters, causing some temporary upheaval. Likely more importantly, the state was starting to rebound from what’s generally referred to as the Great Recession. "Changes to the (HOPE] program had an impact," Ireland said. "But the improving economy also affected enrollment negatively." Colleges and technical schools typically see enrollment increases during economic slumps and decreases as the job market improves, said Mike Light, a spokesman for the Technical College System of Georgia. Earlier this month, Ron Jackson, the agency’s commissioner, wrote Jason Carter after learning Carter was being quoted in the media as saying technical college enrollment is off 45,000, largely due to changes in the HOPE grant program. Jackson said technical colleges added nearly 45,000 students between 2008 and 2010, the peak of the Great Recession. Their enrollment of 151,150 students last year was closer to the colleges’ pre-recession numbers and follows a decline in two-year college enrollment, he wrote Carter. The picture also for some HOPE recipients isn’t as bleak as it first seemed, Jackson said. Of those 11,471 students who could not meet the 3.0 GPA requirement, 2,341 remained in college and graduated. An additional 2,341 came back after the GPA requirement was returned to 2.0 in 2013, he said. Claire Suggs, a senior education policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, agreed that there’s no way to know exactly how many students fell off the HOPE rolls as a result of the policy changes pushed by Deal. "We do know HOPE was a significant driver [in the decline in scholarship and grant awards]," Suggs said.. The " immediate plunge" in awards after the changes were enacted makes that apparent, she said. The Student Finance Commission’s Ireland said the program changes had to be made. In fiscal 2011, agency projections showed that the costs of lottery-funded programs were outstripping new lottery revenues at an accelerating rate. If unchecked, lottery reserves would have been depleted by the end of fiscal 2013, he said. Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Deal, said Democrats’ numbers are "flat wrong and their analysis is sheer speculation." "We saved HOPE," Robinson said. "We maintain the most generous scholarship program in the nation. Vermont should be so lucky." He said Georgia’s technical college enrollment went down because 240,000 new jobs have been created in Deal’s tenure. "That's a big reason technical college enrollment declined," Robinson said. Our conclusion: The number of students who receive HOPE grants and scholarships to attend universities, 2-year, 4-year or technical colleges fell off after changes to the program were enacted in the fiscal year that started July 1, 2011. Those changes undoubtedly were a big factor. Numbers on the Student Finance Commission website show 62,504 fewer HOPE scholarship and grant recipients in the first two years after the new rules were put in place. But state officials say other facts were at play, including the improving economy. Shumlin relied on a magazine article, which included data from only part of a year. There is some truth in his statement. The number of HOPE recipients are down. But they are not down as much as Shumlin said. And the declines can be attributed to a variety of factors. We rate his statement Half True .	None	Peter Shumlin	None	None	None	2014-05-30T00:00:00	2014-05-21	['Nathan_Deal']
pomt-07841	"Governor’s proposed budget raids K-12 school funds to grow DHS again."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/14/dan-lucas/did-john-kitzhaber-raid-schools-human-services/	Money for schools is always a hot topic, even more so as the Legislature starts tackling the budget for 2011-13. Earlier this month, Gov. John Kitzhaber released his proposal, including $5.558 billion for K-12 schools. That figure, charges former Oregon House candidate Dan Lucas in an online post, sacrifices schools for the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority. "Governor’s proposed budget raids K-12 school funds to grow DHS again" is the title of the piece, posted on the conservative-minded Oregon Catalyst. Lucas explains that Kitzhaber not only takes $225 million out of the State School Fund but that he gives the money to human services, which is growing by $333 million. Since the budget is set anew every two years, it’s hard to trace one agency’s growth to the demise of another. But we wanted to know if Lucas’s numbers were accurate. Is K-12 losing money from the previous two-year period? Is social services growing? How much is one to blame for the other? Kitzhaber’s proposal calls for schools to get $5.558 billion of state general fund and lottery dollars. He proposes that human services -- which includes the fairly new Oregon Health Authority and the traditional Department of Human Services -- get $3.8 billion. Naturally, we want to know, what do schools and social services receive now? According to Oregon’s Budget and Management Division , the Legislature approved $5.782 billion for K-12 schools in 2009-11. A $1 billion revenue shortfall prompted two rounds of budget reductions in June and September of 2010, which dropped the K-12 figure to $5.38 billion. After add-backs, however, schools now are on track to receive $5.705 billion for the period that ends June 30. The governor’s proposal is indeed $225 million less than what was allocated originally, and about $147 million less than what was allocated for 2009-11 with reshuffling. Let’s turn to social services. The Oregon Health Authority, which oversees health care, is scheduled to receive $1.74 billion of the $3.8 billion for human services. The Department of Human Services, which handles welfare, food stamps and protective services, will get the remaining $2.05 billion. For 2009-11, the department is on track to receive $3.55 billion in state money. So human services, under the governor’s proposal, will receive $250 million more in state money in 2011-13 than in this period. Now that the numbers are clear, can we say that K-12 shrank to grow Human Services? No, and here’s why: Lots of other areas were whittled in the governor’s proposed budget: Community colleges: $473.6 million in 2009-11 (legislatively approved, general fund and lottery) and $445.5 million in 2011-13. Difference: Down $28.1 million. Oregon University System: $775 million in 2009-11 and $743.2 million in 2011-13. Difference: Down $31.8 million. Oregon Youth Authority: $265.2 million in 2009-11 and $231.7 million in 2011-13. Difference: Down $33.5 million. On the other hand, the Department of Corrections went from an allocated $1.252 billion this biennium to a recommended $1.404 billion in 2011-13. That’s a $152 million increase. You could argue that K-12 was cut to give more money to prisons. But Linda Gilbert with the budget and management division says you can’t even say that -- because Kitzhaber did no pitting of agencies. "He started them all at flat funding and then added revenue back to some. Addback decisions for each agency or program area were made in isolation. So, it would not be true to say that a shortfall in K-12 funding exists to fund corrections," she wrote. Basically, Lucas has a problem with growing Human Services, and he wishes the state would do a better job making its case to the public as to why. He has a problem with the amount of money going to schools, as do House Democrats. We give him credit for getting his numbers correct. But the direct line cause and effect just isn’t there. To say that the governor is "raiding" schools to fund human services contains just an element of truth -- K-12 going down, DHS going up -- and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08398	Jerry Brown "gave California state employees collective bargaining powers" and "now, state employees can retire at 55 with much of their salary for life."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/22/meg-whitman/meg-whitman-ad-blames-brown-too-generous-state-pen/	With California struggling with debt and burdened with costly pension obligations to state workers, Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman is running an ad against Democratic opponent Jerry Brown accusing him of being a shill for labor unions. Here's the text of the ad: How can you retire at age 55? Just ask Jerry Brown. He gave California state employees collective bargaining powers. Since then, the unions have grown stronger and stronger. Now, state employees can retire at 55 with much of their salary for life. And taxpayers are on the hook for $100 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. No wonder those unions are 100 percent behind Jerry Brown. He'll just spend and spend and spend. Brown has a complicated history with labor unions. It's true that as governor in the late '70s and early '80s, he was a champion of collective bargaining rights. And it's also true that under the current system, state employees in California with 25 years of service can retire at age 55 and receive half their salary for life. But whether that's a cause and effect relationship, as the ad implies, is debatable. A little history lesson on California public employee labor laws is in order. In 1968, then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan signed the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, establishing collective bargaining for California's municipal and county employees. But most of the other major collective bargaining laws came during Brown's two terms as governor, between 1975 and 1983. They include the Educational Employment Relations Act of 1976, establishing collective bargaining in California's public schools and community colleges; the Ralph C. Dills Act of 1978, establishing collective bargaining for state government employees; and the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act of 1979, extending collective bargaining to the state university system. "As you can see, Brown signed the major collective bargaining laws for the state," said Dan Mitchell, professor emeritus of management and public policy at UCLA. But whether Brown rightly deserves blame for the current state of the pension system is less clear. "None of these laws directly involve pensions," Mitchell said. "Unions can bargain about pensions or other terms and conditions of employment under these laws. Ultimately, the legislature must approve any bargained deals for state workers." That's essentially the position of the Brown campaign. "Collective bargaining didn't create this system," said Brown campaign spokesman Sterling Clifford. "The bargaining created the system." It wasn't until 1999 that the state adopted a policy that allowed employees to retire five years earlier, at age 55, and get 2 percent of their annual salary for each year of their employment. In other words, someone who retired at age 55 with 25 years under their belt could get 50 percent of their salary in an annual pension. That's why the Whitman ad -- which states that "state employees can retire at 55 with much of their salary for life" -- carries the prominent disclaimer that the scenario "assumes 25-plus years in state employment." Someone who retired at age 55 today, but who worked less than 25 years, would get less than half their current salary. According to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System website, the average years of service for all retirees is 19.6 years. That was a bill signed by then Gov. Gray Davis, 16 years after Brown left office. And it was a measure that caused pension costs to skyrocket. According to the Brown camp, if the pension plan is a bad deal for taxpayers, the governors and state legislators that negotiated them are to blame. Since Brown left the governor's office in 1983, there have been four governors, three of them Republicans, Clifford said. "Any of them could have taken a harder stance on benefits and didn't." Clifford notes that in the year after Brown signed the bill giving collective bargaining rights to state employees, "he then promptly vetoed raises for state employees twice." That's true. In July 1979, Brown twice vetoed proposals to give state workers a 14.5 percent pay hike, at a cost of about $220 million to the state. In a move unpopular with the unions, Brown proposed smaller pay increases for the state workers. The state legislature overrode his vetoes. It's also true that in 1980, Brown okayed a 10.5 percent pay hike for state workers, as well as a 10 percent pension increase for retired state workers. Brown has, indeed, gotten the support of labor unions in his latest gubernatorial bid, but on his campaign website, he calls the pension programs adopted during the years of the Wall Street boom unsustainable. Brown says he would fight to raise the retirement age and lower pension contributions to all new state workers. His unpredictable stance on labor was explored in a July 25, 2010, story in the Sacramento Bee, which ran under the headline, "As governor, Brown had complex relationship with labor." "Like many politicians, Brown has seen his relationship with labor fluctuate, influenced less by ideology than by the state of the economy and public sentiment toward government spending," wrote the Bee's David Siders. "Labor leaders today believe public employee unions will be treated better by Brown than by Whitman, and rhetoric from both campaigns supports that view. But Brown's history with public employees suggests that, if elected, he might at times disappoint them." The story quotes Marty Morgenstern, Brown's chief labor negotiator when he was governor, saying that Brown's relationship with labor was "up and down." "We allowed collective bargaining," Morgenstern said, "but then bargained tough." But the story also argues that Brown's collective bargaining greased the way for union negotiators in future years. "The measure taken by Brown and the legislature (to allow collective bargaining) was significant, improving employees' ability to negotiate and strengthening the stature of employee unions in state politics," the story states. In an Oct. 2, 2009, commentary piece in the Sacramento Bee, Dan Wallter argued Brown "created the almost hegemonic power of public worker unions by giving them collective bargaining rights." So what to rate the Whitman ad's claim that Brown "gave California state employees collective bargaining powers. Since then, the unions have grown stronger and stronger. Now, state employees can retire at 55 with much of their salary for life"? Individually, those facts are all true (although as we noted earlier, you'd have to have worked for 25 years to get at least half your working salary, and most retirees have not). But the implication is that Brown's support of collective bargaining for state employees was responsible for a sweetheart pension deal that many now argue is unsustainable and poses one of the biggest threats to California's future financial health. Perhaps, as some argued, collective bargaining laws set the ground rules that strengthened the unions' position. But subsequent governors and the state legislature still had to negotiate those deals. Brown's track record shows he was sometimes a tough negotiator with the unions. And the most expensive change to the pension program (the one highlighted in the ad) came 16 years after Brown left office. And so we rate the ad's claim Half True.

pomt-06111	"New Jersey taxpayers … will now face the highest tolls in the country."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/02/steve-lonegan/steve-lonegan-says-new-years-day-toll-hike-new-jer/	New Jersey motorists may be fuming over the New Year’s Day toll hikes. But a conservative activist has a case for serious road rage: he claims New Jersey now has the most expensive tolls in the country. Steve Lonegan, director of Americans for Prosperity’s New Jersey chapter, railed against the Jan. 1 toll increase in a newsletter last week. "Did You Know? Tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway, & Atlantic City Expressway Are Set to Go Up 50% on Jan. 1!" the headline on Lonegan’s Dec. 27 email newsletter said. Further down, he wrote: "New Jersey taxpayers, the most over-burdened in the nation, will now face the highest tolls in the country with no noticeable improvement in service." First, tolls are not increasing on the Expressway. But residents are forking over 50 percent more to drive on the Parkway and 53 percent more to drive on the Turnpike. Are those tolls now the highest in the country? That’s one claim to fame New Jersey doesn’t have. The state isn’t top in the country by cost per mile -- a measure several experts said was more significant -- or actual toll prices, according to statistical comparisons. Driving the full span of the Parkway in a passenger car paying cash or E-ZPass now costs $8.25, up from $5.50. A start-to-finish trip for a car paying cash on the Turnpike goes for $13.85 now, up from $9.05. Compare that to $35.55 for a trip from Ohio to New Jersey on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. That’s a cost of more than nine cents per mile -- more than the Parkway, but less than the Turnpike. An analysis conducted for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority by Wilbur Smith Associates, a transportation and infrastructure consulting firm, shows the cost per mile on the Parkway for a car paying cash is now 4.8 cents, up from 3.2 cents. The Turnpike would cost the same motorist 11.3 cents per mile, up from 7.4 cents. Still, there are more than a dozen other roads that charge more than both the Parkway and Turnpike, according to the same analysis. Motorists on Route 73 in California pay 38.3 cents per mile, the Dulles Greenway in Virginia costs drivers 34.3 cents per mile and E-470 in Colorado will set you back 33.4 cents per mile "It seems to me that while the rates for NJ may seem high compared to their past rates – they are nowhere near ‘the highest tolls in the country,’" Neil Gray, the director of government affairs for the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, an association that aims to advance toll financed transportation, said in an email. "It’s ridiculous to say that they’re going to be the highest in the country," said Peter Samuel, editor of the trade publication Toll Roads News. Steve Carrellas, the New Jersey representative of the National Motorists Association, which opposes tolls, said, "they’re not the highest." Lonegan conceded that the per-mile cost on New Jersey’s toll roads aren’t the highest in the country. But he argued New Jersey drivers face the highest toll burden in the country. Motorists have alternatives to "boutique" toll roads in other areas, while drivers in New Jersey are forced to rely on the Parkway and Turnpike, Lonegan said. For a driver heading south from Lonegan's hometown of Bogota, he said "it’s not even practical to think that you are going to take 1&9 to Atlantic City." "It’s not as cut and dry as saying the cost per mile," he said. "We are very much trapped into using these roads." Our ruling With a toll hike on the Parkway and Turnpike, New Jersey now has "the highest tolls in the country," according to Lonegan. Lonegan argued that New Jersey’s toll burden is greater than the rest of the country. But he said "highest tolls" in his newsletter and there are other roads charging more per mile for drivers to head out on the highway. We rate the claim False.

pomt-05028	"America used to be the third easiest country to get established in a business. It's now number 17."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jul/13/charles-bass/it-getting-more-difficult-start-business-us-and-it/	Veteran congressman Rep. Charles Bass, R-NH, labeled 2012 as "gut-check time" in America when he filed to run for another two-year congressional term last month. After signing his papers at the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s Office on June 11, Bass stumped on national jobs and economic issues. His call for a gut check spurred a PolitiFact New Hampshire fact check. "The economy is going nowhere," Bass said, touting jobless rates and unemployment statistics, median income levels and the national debt. "America used to be the third-easiest country to get established in a business," Bass went on. "It’s now number 17, and I could go on." Ranking a country on the "ease" of establishing a business seemed curious, so we contacted his "Victory Committee" to find out which sources Bass used to support his claim. Victory Committee spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne pointed us to Doing Business reports from 2006 and 2012, which are conducted by the World Bank and International Finance Corporation, specifically the "Starting a Business" category listings produced with each. And, they owned up for an error. Bass, "incorrectly stated that we are ranked 17th and instead it should have been 13th" for 2012, Tranchemontagne wrote, though Bass did get the 2006 ranking right. "While the congressman inadvertently stated the wrong number, it is clear that 13th is an entirely unacceptable ranking - and indicates that our economy has been going in the wrong direction." The 2012 study considers a number of factors when weighing the ease of starting a business, including regulations on "starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency (formerly closing a business) and employing workers." Bass was clear about who he thinks is to blame. "Congressman Bass has clearly indicated that he believes that the administration's economic plan is not working and it is time to try something else," Tranchemontagne wrote. But is "the administration" really to blame for the country’s drop on the global "starting a business" list? It is not accurate to compare rankings across several years, according to Nadine Ghannam, head of communications for The World Bank & International Finance Corporation’s Global Indicators and Analysis Department. "Doing Business only publishes rankings for the current year, and the year immediately preceding the publication," Ghannam said. "Rankings are relative and only represent an economy's position vis-a-vis the rest of the economies sampled. An economy's ranking may drop even if the situation did not get worse, simply by the fact that other countries have improved." Essentially, a ranking is only accurate at the time of publication and does not account for data changes that have occurred, Ghannam said, such as countries being added over the years, methodology changes, and minor corrections that were made to the data. What’s more, by examining the data sources, or the indicators and sub-indicators, Ghannam said, one will find that the "Starting a Business" process in the U.S. has not actually changed over the years, except for some fees that have increased "non-significantly." Ghannam used the 2004 report to show that it took six procedures, six days, and a cost of about 0.7 percent of gross national income (GNI) per capita to start a business in the U.S. In 2012, the report shows it still takes six procedures and six days to start a business, with the cost slightly increased to 1.4 percent GNI. "It is important to note that this indicator records the procedures, time, cost and paid-in minimum capital requirement to start a domestic LLC in New York City," Ghannam added, "and therefore all of the costs associated with the increase are a result of fees charged in the State of New York, and not linked to any federal fees." Our ruling: Bass said America took a 14-spot hit from 2006 to 2012 in its ease-of-starting-a-business rank when compared with other countries--and blamed it on the administration. He was four off from the actual Doing Business ranking for the United States--it was ranked 13 in 2012, not 17-- and took credit for his error. And if he had been comparing apples to apples, that might have been a reasonable conclusion. But it turns out, he was off on the logic. The team behind the report says Doing Business rankings should be examined independently of each other. Countries go up or down on the Starting a Business leaderboard if other countries’ have improved, if data has changed, if other countries are added to the list, and other factors--not necessarily because the United States’ own situation has gotten worse. And the process to start a business in the U.S. has hardly changed at all. For getting the ranking wrong and misinterpreting the data, we give Bass a Mostly False.

pomt-13665	The Trans-Pacific Partnership "knocks out 18,000 tariffs that other countries place on American products and goods."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-trans-pacific-partnership-eliminates-/	Speaking with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Loong, President Barack Obama emphasized America’s renewed commitments to the Asian Pacific region. It didn’t take long for the conversation to focus on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade deal pending Senate approval that has been highly contentious in the 2016 election. Defending the deal, Obama made several claims regarding its benefits for American workers. Obama portrayed the deal as having wide-ranging influence — improving American manufacturing by removing tariffs, promoting labor rights in Vietnam and combatting human trafficking in Malaysia. "Number one, it knocks out 18,000 tariffs that other countries place on American products and goods," he said. "So if everybody agrees that we're going to have lower tariffs, that's good for American businesses and American workers. And we should want that, we should pursue it." In this fact-check, we’ll look at the claim about tariffs. Eliminating tariffs We found Obama cited the right numbers, but first we need to explain a few things. Section 2-D of the TPP agreement provides for the gradual elimination of tariffs. As part of the agreement, each country has a "tariff elimination schedule," with some tariffs removed immediately and others phased out over as many as 30 years. The White House calculated 18,000 tariffs by subtracting countries already subject to a free trade-agreement, leaving only Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand and Vietnam. They used a World Trade Organization report to figure out how many goods those countries subject to tariffs, and then calculated the TPP would remove 98 percent. We spoke to trade experts who told us Obama’s number is likely accurate. "It is wholly reasonable for the agreement to eliminate 18,000 tariffs," said Scott Lincicome, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute who specializes in trade policies. "There are obvious caveats to the economic effect of those tariff cuts, but the simple question of whether the TPP does that is very cut and dried." So, yes, the agreement eliminates 18,000 tariffs. But there’s a qualification. The White House informed PolitiFact that in calculating the 18,000 number, it did not exclude goods the United States does not currently export. They did so because reducing tariffs could lead to new goods being exported in the future, and said that was consistent with Obama’s statement. Put simply, the 18,000 figure includes tariffs on American goods that would be removed, and tariffs on products that America isn’t yet exporting but might. "TPP cuts over 18,000 tariffs," said Matthew McAlvanah, assistant U.S. trade tepresentative for public and media affairs. "Those who argue for a lower number do so by undercounting the tariff cuts on current exports and ignoring the reality that tariff cuts expand exports -- including into areas where countries do not export, especially if it's because prohibitively high tariffs block trade on otherwise competitive goods." Lincicome agreed with the White House assessment, saying only counting currently exported goods is a "myopic" view of free trade. Jeffrey Frankel, an economics professor at Harvard University, said including future exports is the "right" measure. Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the 18,000 number is accurate but could have benefited from additional qualification. "I think that there will be some products that the U.S. does not now export to specific countries that would be traded after TPP, but the number is unknowable," Bosworth said. "I think it would be good to say how many of the 18,000 currently appear as a U.S. export to at least one of the other participating countries." If one interpreted the claim as referring to tariffs on goods currently exported by the United States, the White House said the number is 11,467 tariffs. Economic impact Experts also said the economic effects of the tariff cut are debatable. The effects will be lessened because the United States does not have a comparative advantage on all goods. According to comparative advantage theories, countries produce and export what they can produce more efficiently. As such, Lincicome said, not all of the 18,000 tariff cuts will be as significant for some goods as for others. Agricultural products, higher-end manufacturing products and chemicals are likely to benefit the most from the agreement. Also absent from Obama’s claim was a time-frame. Lincicome noted that some tariffs are phased out over several years, and that others don’t go all the way to zero. "You combine those two legal aspects and you’re not just looking at the immediate elimination of 18,000 tariffs," Lincicome explained. "That’s not a bad thing, that’s very standard for United States free trade agreements, for all free trade agreements." J. Bradford Delong, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley, also said the number was likely correct. He added, however, that most of those tariffs being eliminated are small to begin with, which saying "18,000 tariffs" doesn’t capture. Lincicome told us the average TPP tariff reduction is estimated to be from 7 to 15 percent to between zero and 2 percent. Another clarification Lincicome added was that the 18,000 tariffs do not apply to 18,000 different goods, because multiple countries apply tariffs on the same goods. A White House guide on how the TPP would affect state exports, while not comprehensive, only lists around 250 goods. Our ruling Obama said the TPP removes 18,000 tariffs that other countries place on American goods. That number is one reasonable estimation, though it’s leaving out a lot of context. The 18,000 number includes tariffs on goods the United States doesn’t currently export but could in the future.

pomt-00100	As California's Insurance Commissioner, "Steve Poizner pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting MediCal health insurance."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/oct/30/ricardo-lara/fact-checking-immigration-claim-california-insuran/	Democratic State Sen. Ricardo Lara, who is running for California Insurance Commissioner, showcased his opponent’s past stance on immigration in recent full-page newspaper ads in Sacramento and the Central Valley. This claim from the ads caught our attention: "As Insurance Commissioner, Steve Poizner pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting MediCal health insurance." The Ricardo Lara for Insurance Commissioner 2018 campaign produced the ad above. Poizner, who served as insurance commissioner from 2007 to 2011, is running for the open position this year after switching his party affiliation from Republican to Independent. The incumbent, Democrat Dave Jones, is termed out. California’s insurance commissioner regulates the insurance industry and implements state law, but does not create it. We wanted to know whether Lara’s claim about Poizner was accurate. We set out on a fact check. Our research When asked about the claim, Lara’s campaign consultant Richie Ross pointed to a campaign ad from Poizner's 2010 run for governor, when he took several hard-line stances on immigration. The ad shows a car crashing off a cliff, as Poizner says: "We all know California is heading right over a cliff. How did this happen? Years of liberal failure doing too much for too many. Take illegal immigration: Politicians have lacked the guts to tackle the problem. As governor, I will stop taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants." In the ad, Poizner doesn’t specifically bring up health benefits, but instead makes the blanket pledge to stop all benefits for undocumented Californians. Changed positions In April, Poizner told newspaper editorial boards he’s changed some of his positions on immigration. "I regret the tone and direction that we took in that campaign," he said in an interview with the Bay Area News Group editorial board this week, calling his approach in that race "wrong and harmful." Poizner told the editorial board that he now believes everyone who’s undocumented should be "put on a path to get documented," and young people in the DACA program should be eligible for U.S. citizenship, The Mercury News reported. He also told the San Francisco Chronicle editorial board he no longer wants to cut tuition benefits to undocumented immigrants. Poizner said he took his previous anti-immigrant positions while under "huge pressure" in a competitive primary race against former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, according to the newspaper. Poizner’s campaign did not respond to three requests from PolitiFact California on where he stands on the specific issue of providing health benefits to undocumented children. During his time in the Legislature, Lara has worked to expand health coverage to all undocumented Californians. In 2015, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Lara's Health For All Kids Act 2015, which gave Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented kids and teens. Our ruling Democratic State Sen. Ricardo Lara claimed in full-page newspaper ads that his opponent in California’s Insurance Commissioner race, Steve Poizner, "pledged to block immigrant children from ever getting MediCal health insurance," when Poizner previously held the state post. Poizner did make a general promise to block benefits for undocumented Californians, though that was eight years ago, in a Republican primary race for governor. He said in an ad: "I will stop taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants," though he didn’t specify the kind of benefits. Notably, Lara’s statement ignores Poizner’s shift on immigration. Poizner told newspapers this spring he now favors some benefits for undocumented Californians and a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, and that his past approach was "harmful." Poizner’s campaign did not respond to requests about his stance on health benefits for undocumented children, leaving his position on that unclear. In the end, we found there’s some truth to Lara’s statement, but it leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-11644	"In Trump’s first year as president, job growth slowed to a six-year low."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/16/democratic-national-committee/dnc-strains-find-problems-current-job-market/	As the first anniversary of Donald Trump’s presidency drew near, the Democratic National Committee published a Medium post critical of Trump’s tenure. A reader suggested that we look at the Jan. 16 post, which was titled "Trump At One Year: President For The 1%." In focusing on Trump’s economic record, the post at one point said, "In Trump’s first year as president, job growth slowed to a six-year low." The DNC has a point, but it carefully chose the talking point to shine a poor light on what, by most measures, is an impressive period of job growth. The following chart summarizes the yearly growth in nonfarm employment since 2008. Years under President Barack Obama are in blue, while the one year under Trump is in red. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Using this measure, the DNC actually undersold its point a bit. The annual job gains in 2017 — 2,055,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — are the smallest since 2010, or seven years. (Important technical caveat: The figures for November and December 2017 are preliminary and could be adjusted either up or down in the next few months to account for new data. We are rating this statement based on what was known at the time of the DNC’s post.) That said, the DNC is straining to portray a favorable job market as a disappointment. Some additional context to consider: • An annual job gain of more than 2 million is impressive in its own right. "In four of the previous six years under Obama, U.S. job creation was not much faster than it was in 2017," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Specifically, annual job gains in four years — 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2016 — were close to what Trump saw in 2017. Equally important, that pace of job creation is "well ahead of what the economy needs to keep up with slow working-age-population growth," said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for the jobs site Indeed.com. • The job gains under Trump are especially impressive because they came at a later point in the recovery. Rapid employment gains are generally easier early in a recovery because more people are unemployed or underemployed. That means there will be a surplus of possible applicants for new job openings, which generally means the jobs can be filled quickly. By contrast, after seven years of improving employment prospects, "there are fewer unemployed and out-of-the-labor-force workers who are willing to take jobs than was true when the unemployment rate was higher," Burtless said. This made it "harder to achieve rapid job gains in 2017," he said. • Other measures make 2017 look more impressive. Consider the unemployment rate, the other key jobs-related metric. (In this chart, a negative gain is "good" since it means that unemployment is heading downward.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The improvement under Trump in 2017 (0.7 percent) exceeded the improvement in all but two of the years under Obama. Kolko added that several other measurements of the labor force were better in 2017 than in 2016, including the U-6 rate (which uses a broader definition of unemployment than the usual rate cited above) and the percentage of the population between 25 and 54 years old that is employed. Our ruling The DNC wrote that "in Trump’s first year as president, job growth slowed to a six-year low." This statistic is carefully chosen to make what is actually a strong job market appear disappointing. Experts say the gain of more than 2 million jobs in 2017 was healthy, especially coming at a later point in the recovery, and it was similar in scope to half of the years during Obama’s presidency.

pomt-00235	Says Gavin Newsom "didn’t solve the homeless problem at all" as mayor of San Francisco, "and it’s gotten worse."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/oct/08/john-cox/fact-checking-gavin-newsoms-record-solving-homeles/	During his run for California governor, Republican John Cox has tried to tie Democrat Gavin Newsom to the state’s growing homeless problem. In Cox’s latest radio campaign ad, a narrator even uses "Newsomville" to describe the state’s homeless camps "springing up in every town." At Monday’s gubernatorial debate, Cox attacked Newsom over San Francisco’s struggle with this human crisis. "Gavin was mayor (of San Francisco) for eight years. He didn’t solve the homeless problem here at all. And it’s gotten worse." We wanted to know whether Cox was right. Did Newsom really fail to "solve the problem at all"? And has it "gotten worse"? We set out on a fact check. Our research Newsom was San Francisco’s mayor from January 2004 to January 2011. He has served as the state’s lieutenant governor for the past seven-plus years. Few big city mayors in the United States, if any, have completely solved homelessness during their tenures. For his part, Newsom has often pointed to his role in cutting San Francisco’s "street population by 40 percent" during his time as mayor, adding his administration "got 12,000 people off the street." His campaign has cited the 2009 San Francisco Homeless Count and Survey to support that statement. We examined that claim in May and rated it Half True. We found Newsom cherry-picked the timeframe of this reduction, which took place from 2002 to 2009, two years before he became mayor to two years before he left that office. The street population went back up by 400 during his final two years. But even considering that uptick, the city’s unsheltered total still decreased by 31 percent from 2002 to 2011 RELATED: Fact check round-up of California governor's debate Tracking San Francisco's overall homeless population We also noted that Newsom’s statement does not reflect the slight increase in San Francisco’s overall homeless population during his time as mayor. The first available report during his tenure, from January 2005, shows a total of 6,248. By January 2011, Newsom’s final month in office, that number was 6,455. San Francisco’s most recent overall count, from June 2017, places the total at 7,499. That’s 1,044 higher than Newsom’s final month as mayor, and generally supports the last portion of Cox’s statement that the problem has "gotten worse." Newsom credited as leader While the homeless crisis continues in San Francisco, Newsom has been credited as a leader on the topic. A 2010 San Francisco Chronicle article said Newsom had "moved more homeless people into supportive housing in his seven years in office than any other mayor in the city's history - and has one of the best track records of any mayor in the country on that score." Newsom’s campaign pointed a 2016 Chronicle investigation Beyond Homelessness, which examined the city’s response to the issue over the past two decades. Here’s what the newspaper found: "Gavin Newsom, took the most aggressive stance yet toward tackling the issue. In 2004, he announced a 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness. While it failed to reach that goal, it did result in moving 22,000 homeless people off the streets either into housing or onto buses headed home. And in the past few years, the majority of the city’s indigent military veterans — many suffering post-traumatic stress from as far back as the 1970s — have been moved indoors, thanks in part to a national effort led by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. And yet the city’s streets look the same today. "There’s a mythology that you can, quote unquote, end homelessness at any moment," Newsom said in 2014. "But there are new people coming in, suffering through the cycles of their lives. It’s the manifestation of complete, abject failure as a society. We’ll never solve this at City Hall." The city’s bus ticket program, Homeward Bound, which accounts for sending thousands of homeless out of San Francisco, has been criticized by some homeless advocacy groups as simply moving the problem elsewhere. Asked to support Cox’s claim, his spokesman responded in an email: "Wait, is there not a homeless problem in SF?" Our ruling Republican John Cox claimed Gavin Newsom "didn’t solve the homeless problem" in San Francisco "at all," adding "it’s gotten worse." Under Newsom’s administration, San Francisco’s homeless street population fell by 31 percent, from 2002 to 2011. Newsom has been credited with taking an aggressive stance on the topic and for helping move thousands off the street into housing or onto buses. The overall sheltered and unsheltered homeless population, however, rose slightly during Newsom’s tenure, and has increased since he left office by more than 1,000, supporting the second part of Cox’s statement. But the first part of his claim, that Newsom didn’t solve the problem "at all," ignores his accomplishments. While homelessness didn’t end on Newsom’s watch, he made steps considered unprecedented for the city. We rate Cox’s statement Half True.

pomt-01555	"I sponsored the new Buy American law"	false	/oregon/statements/2014/sep/12/shemia-fagan/did-oregon-state-rep-shemia-fagan-sponsor-new-buy-/	State Rep. Shemia Fagan, a first-term Democrat, is running for re-election for House District 51. House Republicans, who support Fagan’s challenger, Jodi Bailey, sent us a statement from Fagan’s Voters’ Pamphlet entry. They argue that the statement mischaracterizes Fagan’s involvement in a bill introduced into the regular session of the 2013 Legislature. The claim: The statement pertains to House Bill 3473, which would have amended part of the state’s public contracting code to require public agencies to buy American-made iron or steel if the purchase amount exceeded $50,000. Fagan says in her entry: "I sponsored Oregon’s new Buy American law and fought to give local companies the first shot at state contracts, so your hard earned tax dollars create more jobs here at home." "HB 3473 of the 2013 session did NOT become law," wrote Kara Walker, a House Republicans’ spokeswoman. "Rep. Fagan’s assertion that she sponsored a new law is false and misleading." PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. The analysis: We contacted Fagan’s campaign. Fagan, a business attorney by profession, defended her choice of words in an email. "Yes, the terms ‘bill’ and ‘law’ are frequently used interchangeably in common speak," she wrote, "particularly by everyday Oregonians, who are the audience for my Voter’s Pamphlet statement." A quick Google search, she added, turned up two instances supporting her assertion. One linked to a report by a southern Oregon television station headlined "Now it’s Oregon Senate’s turn to vote on gun laws." The second took us to a press release issued last spring by the Oregon Republican Party. The release, Fagan said, "...used the terms ‘bill’ and ‘law’ interchangeably." We checked the state’s legislative website and found Fagan among the 10 sponsors -- six Democrats and four Republicans -- of HB 3473. The bill had a first reading in the House on March 28, 2013. One public hearing was held on April 10, 2013. The bill was still stuck in the House Business and Labor Committee when the session ended on July 8, 2013. So could she rightfully call it a law? We called Legislative Counsel Dexter Johnson, whose office reviews legislators’ proposals for new laws and drafts them into bill form for presentation to the full assembly. He walked us through the bill-drafting process then summed up: "This is technically a bill. It didn’t become law." We called Vera Katz, a longtime Oregon Democratic legislator who served as speaker of the House and later as Portland mayor. We didn’t identify Fagan by name, but asked if "bill" and "law" are routinely used interchangeably in Salem. "That’s not accurate," she said. "It’s a bill. It’s not a law. That person should have been more careful." We turned to the links Fagan provided. The KPIC (Roseburg) headline referred to "gun laws," but every reference in the story was to "bills." The GOP press release, issued April 4, 2013, stated why the party opposed four proposed Democratic gun bills. "Such laws," the release stated, "assume the guilt of all firearms owners…" That language, however, seems conditional, gathering any anti-gun legislation under one umbrella and saying, in essence, "laws such as these aren’t needed." Finally, we tackled the aspect of Fagan’s claim where she argues that the words ‘bill’ and ‘law’ "are frequently used interchangeably in common speak, particularly by everyday Oregonians…" PolitiFact Oregon hit the streets and put the question to the first two dozen people we encountered: Where the Legislature is concerned, are the words "bill" and "law" interchangeable? Not counting the three people who waved us off, all answered immediately that the terms are separate and distinct. The ruling: Fagan, in her first re-election bid for House District 51, wrote in her Voters’ Pamphlet that she "sponsored Oregon’s new Buy American law." HB 3473, the proposal to amend Oregon’s public contract code, died in committee after one public hearing. It didn’t pass either chamber and was never signed into law by Gov. John Kitzhaber. The office that drafts legislative proposals said the words can’t be used interchangeably, while a longtime Oregon politician said Fagan should "have been more careful" in her statement. The links Fagan provided to defend her statement fell short of being persuasive, and a quick and unscientific survey of "everyday people" failed to back her claim. If re-elected, Fagan said she plans to reintroduce the bill in the 2015 session. There’s still the chance, then, that her bill will become a law. In the meantime, we rate her claim False.

pomt-15260	Says Hillary Clinton "refuses to testify before Congress" about the 2012 attack in Benghazi.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/31/facebook-posts/meme-says-hillary-clinton-refuses-testify-benghazi/	A meme critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has recently been making the rounds on social media. The meme is headlined "I’m not ready for Hillary" -- a takeoff on the PAC that supported Clinton during the months leading up to her official announcement -- and proceeds to list five reasons to oppose the former secretary of state. In this article, we’ll check one of those claims -- that Clinton "refuses to testify before Congress about what really happened at Benghazi where four Americans died." As most readers will recall, on Sept. 11, 2012, Islamic extremists attacked U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, killing U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Clinton was secretary of state at the time, and critics -- many of them Republicans -- have insisted there’s more to be learned about the attacks. However, the claim in the meme struck us as odd, since Clinton has already testified twice on Benghazi, both on Jan. 23, 2013. On that day, she testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the morning and before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the afternoon. In fact, this produced some memorable and widely replayed video when Clinton offered an exasperated comment in response to questioning by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. "With all due respect," she said, "the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator." So the meme’s claim seems wrong on its face. We could not track down the meme’s creator, and we did not receive a response to an email sent to an author who wrote about it for a conservative website. There is a committee -- the House Select Committee on Benghazi chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. -- that’s still investigating the matter. The committee and Clinton have indeed had some trouble coming to an agreement about her appearance before the committee. But the bones of contention are primarily logistical, not because Clinton "refuses to testify." Quite the contrary: In a letter written to the committee on May 4, 2015, Clinton’s lawyer, David E. Kendall, made that clear. "Please let me know what date the Secretary may appear before the Committee to publicly testify again about the attacks on the U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, and to answer questions the Committee may have about her email use at the same hearing -- whether that be during the week of May 18th or at a later date. On such a day, she will stay as long as necessary to answer the Committee's questions, but will not prolong the Committee's efforts further by appearing on two separate occasions when one will suffice," Kendall wrote. Committee Democrats said that Clinton had made clear as early as December 2014 that she was willing to testify before Gowdy’s panel. As it happened, May came and went without an appearance by Clinton, but the campaign said on July 25 that she would be appearing before the committee instead in October 2015. The two parties are still negotiating the final logistics. But differing over logistical negotiations are not the same thing as refusing to testify. The Benghazi panel itself acknowledged in a July 25 statement that the issue has not been whether Clinton would testify, but how. Citing Kendall’s letter, the panel noted that "while insisting she would appear only a single time before the Committee, (he said) that Secretary Clinton would answer all questions the Committee had about Libya, Benghazi, and her unusual email arrangement with herself." A past source of friction between the Clinton camp and the committee -- to what extent Clinton’s "unusual email arrangement" should be subject to questioning -- is smoothed over by now. The Clinton camp told PolitiFact that they are "in agreement" with the committee’s view that, as the committee put it in its statement, Clinton’s email arrangement "falls within the scope of the Select Committee's jurisdiction." Our ruling A social media meme says that Clinton "refuses to testify before Congress about what really happened at Benghazi where four Americans died." This makes no sense, since she has already testified twice, in public and on live television, about the Benghazi attack. Moreover, we find no evidence that Clinton has been opposed to testifying before Gowdy’s panel. What has kept her from testifying so far are disagreements between the two camps over scheduling and formatting -- not over whether she would testify or not. Any past disagreements about the scope of her testimony appear to have been resolved as of this writing. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04260	Says under President Barack Obama, the United States has created "five million jobs."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/12/robert-menendez/us-sen-robert-menendez-says-united-states-has-crea/	Before the two Democratic incumbents were re-elected Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez sought to put a number on President Barack Obama’s record on the economy: 5 million new jobs. At an Oct. 27 campaign rally in Monmouth County, the senator claimed, "this president has taken us from the abyss and from losing millions of jobs under Bush to having made 5 million jobs." Two days before voters headed to the polls, Menendez repeated the line at a Nov. 4 rally in Burlington County. Under Obama, the United States "went from losing millions of jobs to creating 5 million jobs," Menendez told the crowd. Five million new jobs? Well, it depends when you start counting and what types of jobs you’re talking about. Our PolitiFact colleagues issued a Half True ruling in October on a similar claim by Obama, who said his administration has created 5 million jobs "over the last 30 months in the private sector alone." Like Obama’s statement, Menendez’s claim is accurate only when you consider the net increase of nearly 5 million private-sector jobs since February 2010, the low point in the private-sector job market. When you pull the yardstick back to different points during the first year of Obama's presidency, private-sector job growth has been less than what Menendez claimed. Also, in terms of total jobs, those private-sector gains have been offset by losses in the public-sector. A spokeswoman for Menendez declined to comment. Let’s break down the numbers. As the end point for our analyses, we’re using the preliminary figures for October 2012, the latest jobs data available at the time of Menendez’s most recent statement. Between February 2010 and October 2012, Obama presided over the net creation of just under 5 million private-sector jobs, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the story changes slightly when you factor in the loss of public-sector jobs. Then, the net increase in total jobs has been about 4.5 million. Still, starting at February 2010 represents cherry-picking a time frame that provides the best possible outlook on job growth. Let’s see what happens when we measure job growth from three separate starting points during Obama's first year in office: January 2009, when Obama was sworn in; February 2009, his first full month in office; and June 2009, the official beginning of the recovery, as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. In short, those starting points show there’s been less job growth than Menendez claimed. Since January 2009, there’s been a net increase of 759,000 private-sector jobs. But given public-sector job losses, the net increase in total jobs has been 194,000. Since February 2009, the nation has gained 1,484,000 private-sector jobs and lost 566,000 public-sector jobs, leaving it with a net increase of 918,000 total jobs. Start at June 2009, and the net increase in private-sector jobs has been roughly 3.8 million. The net gain in total jobs lands at about 3.2 million, however, when factoring in the loss of 559,000 public-sector jobs. One last note: experts have said that presidents have a limited impact on employment changes. So, it’s not appropriate to give Obama too much credit for job growth or too much blame for job losses. Our ruling At two campaign rallies leading up to the election, Menendez claimed that under Obama, the United States has created "five million jobs." That’s only true if you’re talking about private-sector job growth since February 2010. When you factor in public-sector job losses and start counting at different points during Obama’s first year in office, the employment picture is far from what Menendez claimed.

pomt-03127	Unemployment in Texas has risen over two percentage points with Rick Perry as governor.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/sep/17/john-currie/garden-state-democrat-compares-texas-jobless-rates/	A New Jersey Democrat recently proclaimed similarities between the Republican governors of the Garden State and Texas, saying Chris Christie and Rick Perry both have hurt women, families and their respective state’s economy. John Currie, who chairs the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, aired his criticisms in a Sept. 9, 2013, guest post on a blog, the Austin-based, pro-Democratic Burnt Orange Report. Noting that Christie was making a Texas political fundraising trip, Currie took Perry to task for fresh abortion restrictions he signed into law as well as cuts in public school spending approved in 2011. Currie also touched on the state’s high ranking in residents paid the minimum wage; in August 2011, we rated such a claim as True. But the Currie claim that drew the Texas Truth-O-Meter had to do with more Texans being jobless than before Perry became governor. Currie wrote: "After over a decade in office, the unemployment rate in Texas has risen by over two (percentage) points," according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. "When he (Perry) took office in January 2001, the unemployment rate there was 4.2 percent. As of this summer, it is 6.5 percent." Perry, governor since late 2000, has long touted Texas’ job gains. Along those lines, we’ve quoted Pia Orrenius, a senior economist for the Federal Reserve branch in Dallas, as saying that some of the favorable economic factors in Texas are its booming Gulf ports and its surging trade with Mexico and China. Orrenius also ranks among experts who have told us that job gains and losses in a state aren’t controlled by whoever is governor. Orrenius said in June 2011: "Long before Rick Perry (became governor), we were talking about the great Texas economy." Still, did joblessness get worse on Perry’s watch? To our inquiry, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS regional economist, emailed charts showing that the Texas unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in January 2001, Perry’s first full month as governor. The state’s jobless rate was 6.5 percent in July 2013, the latest month for which the bureau calculated a rate before Currie’s article appeared. There’s a 2.3 percentage point difference. A refresher: The unemployment rate, based on government surveys, reflects the estimated share of adults hunting for work who say they are unemployed. In January 2001, by this measure, nearly 443,000 Texas adults in the state workforce of nearly 10.5 million were jobless, according to the bureau. In June 2013, the latest month for which the bureau had comparable figures, 831,850 adults were unemployed in the workforce of nearly 12.8 million, the bureau says. According to the government surveys, nearly 12 million Texans had jobs in June 2013 compared with 10 million in January 2001. There are other substantive wrinkles to consider. For instance, the Texas jobless rate didn’t steadily surge from the New Jerseyan’s cited 4.2 percent to 6.5 percent. Instead, according to the bureau, the rate essentially went up, then down, then up, then down, then up. Specifically, the rate rose to 6.9 percent as of June and July 2003; decreased to 4.3 percent for April through September 2007; increased to 8.3 percent in February and March 2010; and then fell or decreased most months from April 2010 to December 2012 when it was 6.2 percent. In 2013, it went from 6.3 percent in January to 6.5 percent in May through July. Other aspects: The Texas unemployment rate exceeded the national jobless rate for the first 70-plus months of Perry’s governorship, according to the bureau, but the rate has trailed the national rate since January 2007, or for 79 months. The national rate was 7.4 percent in July 2013, the bureau says. Abbot, asked to elaborate on the changes, replied: "For the most part, Texas (and all other states) followed the national pattern as far as unemployment rates are concerned. When the economy was doing well, unemployment rates were low and when the economy was doing poorly, jobless rates were high. Where the state differences manifest themselves is in the specific timing of upturns and downturns and the magnitude of change in their unemployment rates," she wrote. "Some states entered the" latest "recession later than others." By telephone, Bernard "Bud" Weinstein, a Southern Methodist University economist, said he prefers to judge economies by federal surveys of employers indicating how many individuals are on payrolls rather than depending on household surveys behind the unemployment rates. "How many people are bringing home regular paychecks?" Weinstein said. At our request, BLS economist James B. Howard Jr. emailed a chart reflecting results of the payroll surveys. It indicated that more than 9.5 million individuals were on Texas payrolls in January 2001, while nearly 11.2 million were on payrolls in July 2013, the difference being 17 percent. Nationally, according to the bureau, the nation had about 3 percent more individuals on payrolls in July 2013 (136 million people) compared to January 2001 (133 million). Weinstein said too that it remains questionable how much a governor controls economic conditions, which would include unemployment. Many other individuals and factors come into play, he said, of late including the financial collapse on Wall Street, the housing bust and credit difficulties. "Economies are global," Weinstein said. Our ruling Currie said unemployment has risen more than two percentage points during Perry’s governorship. This is supported by cherry-picking the latest available Texas jobless rate, 6.5 percent for July 2013, and comparing it to the 4.2 percent rate in January 2001, Perry’s first full month as governor. But this delivers an incomplete picture given that the state’s jobless rate bounced around through the 12-plus years. One can also note, for instance, that the 2013 monthly rates have been lower than the Perry-era high of 8.3 percent in early 2010. Also, the Texas rate has trailed the national rate for more than six years. Finally, it’s not reasonable to blame (or credit) a governor for a state’s unemployment rate. How an economy fares is not determined by the state’s chief elected official.

pomt-12185	"In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/27/anthony-scaramucci/it-felony-leak-financial-disclosure-form-anthony-s/	Anthony Scaramucci, the new White House communications director, called for a full-blown federal investigation of leaks in a tweet. "In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony," he wrote on Twitter, "I will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept #swamp @Reince45" He later deleted the tweet. The White House did not provide information for this fact-check. First, it’s important to note that the financial disclosure was a public record, not secret information. Second, Scaramucci’s financial disclosure form wasn’t leaked. It was available upon request from Scaramucci’s former employer, the Export-Import Bank, as of July 23, 2017, or 30 days after it was filed. This is how Lorraine Woellert, the Politico reporter who broke the story, got it. "My source for @Scaramucci financials was Ex-Im Bank. Period." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Export-Import Bank confirmed Woellert put in a request to their ethics office and said that any reporter was welcome to put in the same request. When the New York Times asked Scaramucci why he thought the report had been leaked, he said, "They aren’t in process yet," but didn’t elaborate. He did not respond when told the form could be released as of July 23. Scaramucci’s claim the leak was a felony would be off even if, as he seemed to believe, the 30-day period had not yet ended. Law experts told us that criminal statutes apply only to those who leak nonpublic national security information, like classified information or the identity of undercover agents, for theft of government property. The government has pursued such cases multiple times. However, Scaramucci’s financial disclosure forms were not of relevance to national security. There are also laws on computer privacy that aren’t limited to classified information. According to James Hoopes, Murata Professor of Business Ethics at Babson College, it may have been a felony if the financial disclosure form was obtained by hacking a computer, which it wasn’t. There are also statutes that criminalize certain disclosures, such as the disclosure of tax returns, enacted after President Richard Nixon used these to go after his political enemies. But there’s no such statute for financial disclosure forms. Disclosures of personal information could potentially form the basis of a civil suit for violation of the Privacy Act, according to Kathleen Clark, a legal ethics expert and law professor at Washington University. The Privacy Act says that agencies can’t disclose records that are contained in a system of records without the consent of the individual. But even that wouldn’t constitute a felony, and the time the record was to be contained had expired. Scaramucci acknowledged the weakness of his original legal claim to Chris Cuomo on CNN, but he stayed on message with regards to leaks. "I understand the law. I know that there was a public disclosure mechanism in my financial forms," Scaramucci said. "What I'm upset about is the process and the junk pool, the dirty pool, Chris, in terms of the way this stuff is being done, and the leaking won't stop." Some reporters posited that Scaramucci’s inclusion of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus’ handle in the tweet was an accusation of having produced the leak. After deleting the original tweet, Scaramucci wrote another tweet to correct the record and again tagged Priebus. "Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45". See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores responded to Scaramucci’s original tweeted request that the Justice Department launch a federal investigation into leaks. ‘We have seen an astonishing increase in the number of leaks of classified national security information in recent months," Isgur Flores said in a press release. "We agree with Anthony that these staggering number of leaks are undermining the ability of our government to function and to protect this country. Like the Attorney General has said, ‘whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail,’ and we will aggressively pursue leak cases wherever they may lead." The FBI did not respond to our request for comment on Scaramucci’s call to action, but directed our question of whether a leak of financial disclosure forms constituted a felony to the Justice Department. The Justice Department did not respond. Our rating Scaramucci called the leak of his financial disclosure form a felony in a tweet that he later deleted. He was incorrect in calling the publishing of his form a leak, as it was a public document provided to the Politico reporter by the Export-Import Bank after the required 30 days of his filing. Even if it had been provided earlier, though, experts told us the leak of financial disclosure information wouldn’t be considered a felony, unless someone had hacked the system to obtain it.

pomt-05996	Says Mitt Romney "put Planned Parenthood on a state medical board but failed to put a pro-life group on the same board."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/20/newt-gingrich/Gingrich-ad-says-Mitt-Romney-appointed-Planned-Par/	Even after Mitt Romney changed his position on abortion to pro-life, a new attack ad says he "governed pro-abortion." The ad, put out by the Newt Gingrich campaign, is airing in South Carolina before the state’s presidential primary. It raises several examples from Romney’s abortion record, including this one: that he "put Planned Parenthood on a state medical board but failed to put a pro-life group on the same board." We decided to look further. The board and what it does The ad cites the text of the far-reaching Massachusetts health care law Romney signed in 2006 when he was governor, as well as the website ProLifeProfiles.com. Among other things, the law establishes the MassHealth Payment Policy Advisory Board and says it shall have "one member appointed by Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts." It also includes two heads of state agencies plus members from the mental health field, a hospital association, aging services and other areas. It does not specify that an abortion opponent be appointed. The governor of Massachusetts gets to appoint two of the 14 board members. When Romney was governor, he appointed Deborah Enos, president of Neighborhood Health Plan, a Medicaid managed care organization, and Bob Moran, an expert in payment methodologies at the University of Massachusetts. (Both are named in this implementation report from 2006.) It’s true that neither of them represents an anti-abortion group. The problem with the Gingrich ad's claim, however, is that the board’s job is to review state Medicaid reimbursement rates -- it does not address abortion policy at all. "It has nothing to do with saying what they’ll cover, what they won’t cover" in abortion services, said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, an organization opposed to abortion. We also reached out to NARAL Pro-Choice America, which advocates for legal abortion, for its take on the matter. Spokesman Ted Miller responded that the group’s position "is that the Massachusetts healthcare plan enacted during former Gov. Romney’s tenure replaced a program that already covered abortion. Thus, Romney should not get credit for improving women's access to abortion in Massachusetts." Our ruling Gingrich’s ad argues that Romney, after changing his position on abortion to "pro-life," made governing decisions contrary to that stance. One example, according to the ad: He appointed Planned Parenthood to a state medical board but didn’t also appoint a pro-life group. But the board the ad refers to was created as part of Massachusetts’ health care overhaul, which the Legislature passed and which Romney signed, and its function is to review Medicaid reimbursement rates. The law also specifies where 12 of the board's 14 members must come from, including one member appointed by Planned Parenthood. It's true that Romney didn’t appoint any abortion foes to the board -- but the board doesn’t deal with abortion or have any say in what abortion services are covered by state-subsidized insurance policies. So that claim is correct but leaves out an important detail. Our ruling: Half True.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-01-20T14:05:18	2012-01-10	['None']

pomt-02959	Georgia "spends in the top 10 nationally on education, yet, most of our education metrics hover in the bottom five."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/25/nancy-jester/ex-dekalb-school-official-says-states-spending-res/	Since Nancy Jester’s departure from the DeKalb County school board, she has kept busy. She hosts a radio show focused on education. And she’s still a fixture on the DeKalb education scene, with an active website and blog about the district’s issues and all things education related. Earlier this month, Jester took her ideas to The Marietta Daily Journal for an op-ed about the controversial Common Core national education standards. "Our state spends in the top 10 nationally on education, yet, most of our education metrics hover in the bottom five. We have to admit that we need a change in leadership on educational issues in Georgia," Jester said. "… Georgia has a long road ahead but Common Core is not a path to prosperity." It is important to note that Georgia was the ninth most populous state in the nation, at the last census count in 2010. And the Peach State also had the eighth most K-12 students in the country. So, having a lot of students would equal more education spending. We wanted to determine whether Jester was correct on the state’s education finances and student achievement, so we hit the books for answers. Jester, who is considering a run for state school superintendent, told us she got her information from 2010 census reports. We reviewed the Census Bureau’s public education finance report for that year, which included public school spending data by state. Using the aggregate spending figure -- including money from federal, state and local sources -- Jester was correct. Georgia spent the 10th most on education in fiscal 2010, at $15.7 billion. California, New York, Texas, Illinois, New Jersey, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan spent more than Georgia. A census researcher also led us to the 2011 education finance report for more recent figures. Again, on aggregate spending, Georgia ranked 10th, with the same states from the previous year rounding out the other top positions. Jester’s claim is based on overall education spending, but Georgia’s rank drops substantially in those years, to 33rd and 35th respectively, when per-pupil spending is considered, according to census reports. When adjusted for regional costs of living, Georgia ranked worse at 38th nationally for per-pupil spending in 2012. We next turned to education metrics. Jester didn’t mention specific benchmarks, but generally ACT and SAT scores, and graduation rates are used to measure state performance through student achievement. We checked the U.S. Department of Education’s state-by-state graduation rates for the 2010-2011 school year (the most recent available). Georgia’s four-year graduation rate was 67 percent that year, lower than every state except Nevada and New Mexico. The low rate that year was partly attributed to the DOE’s new four-year calculation, implemented nationally for the first time, and based on how many ninth-graders graduate with a standard diploma within four years. Before the new calculation, some states included students in their graduation rates who took longer to receive their diplomas. Under the old calculation, Georgia had an 81 percent graduation rate in the 2009-2010 school year. We then looked at ACT scores. In 2013, about 51 percent of Georgia graduates took the ACT, combining for a state composite score of 20.7, out of a possible score of 36. (The national average composite score for that year was 20.9.) Georgia’s scores were not in the bottom five among other states this year, nor in 2012 when the state’s students also achieved a 20.7 composite score. We also examined Georgia’s scores on the other popular college admissions test, the SAT, administered by the College Board. On that test, Georgia’s average score from 2012 to 2013 was flat, at 1452 out of 2400 possible points. The state score was below the national SAT average score of 1498 for both years. The Commonwealth Foundation, a free-market think tank in Pennsylvania, compiled SAT data for 2013, which listed Georgia as 45th in the nation based on its scores. Georgia is considered a high-participation state for the SAT, with 75 percent of students taking the test this year. The Peach State ranked just above the bottom five in that list, but close enough to support Jester’s claim. We also considered the Education Weekly’s annual Quality Counts reports that focuses on state efforts in education. This year, Georgia ranked seventh among states with a B- rating of 81.0 out of a possible 100 points. (The 2013 national average was a C+, 76.9 rating.) Georgia received the same rank and letter grade in 2012. The report tracks six areas of policy and performance. Georgia received A’s in the areas of Transitions and Alignment and Standards, Assessments, and Accountability. But received C’s in the areas of K-12 Achievement, Chance for Success and School Finance. So does Jester’s claim earn a passing grade? She is correct that Georgia spends in the top 10 nationally for public K-12 spending. But Georgia is also in the top 10 nationally for the number of K-12 students in the state, so a high level of spending is expected. It is also important to note that Georgia’s ranking drops significantly, to the bottom third of all states, for per-pupil spending. National results of college readiness exams and graduation rates ranked Georgia among the bottom in most reports. Georgia did rank in the top 10 states nationally in a survey touted by state education officials. But even in that report, Georgia scored low marks in key areas, including student achievement. Jester’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details about education funding that could give the reader a different impression. We rate Jester’s claim Half True.

pomt-02350	Says Stefani Carter "repeatedly used her campaign contributors’ donations to rent margarita machines for our state house office."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/21/linda-koop/rep-stefani-carter-twice-rented-margarita-machines/	A salty claim figured into a Republican challenger’s campaign before the March 4, 2014, primary for the party’s nomination for a Dallas County seat in the Texas House. Candidate Linda Koop mailed out a flier with an illustration of a festively decorated margarita machine that said incumbent Stefani Carter of Dallas "repeatedly used her campaign contributors’ donations to rent margarita machines for our state house office." We learned about the flier via Scott Braddock, a writer for the Capitol news website Quorum Report. As best we could tell, there’s nothing illegal about throwing a margarita party for legislative staff with campaign funds, and Koop spokesman Craig Murphy told us by phone, "We’re not alleging that it’s illegal," just questioning what constituents and donors would think of the expenses. Koop faces Carter in the May 27 runoff for the Republican nomination. We decided to see whether the margarita machine charge checked out. Koop’s mailer, which Murphy said went out Feb. 25, cites "Texas Ethics Commission records." Murphy said the margarita expenses were revealed in Carter’s campaign contribution and expenditure reports, specifically her July 15, 2011, semi-annual report and July 15, 2013, semi-annual report. There, the campaign listed two payments to Margaritas To Go of Austin: $258.72 paid June 3, 2011, for an "end-of-session staff/hall party" and $117.99 paid April 1, 2013, for "Rental of Margaritas To Go machine for staffer’s birthday." We found no other margarita mentions in any reports filed by Carter going back to 2010, when she was elected to the House, thoughtwo liquor-store purchases were described as expenses for 2010 and 2012 campaign victory parties in Dallas. By email, Carter campaign manager Nicole Pearce said of the margarita machine events, "Rep. Carter paid for the traditional ‘sine die’ celebration at the end of the 2011 Legislative session, as well as one birthday party for a staff member in 2013, with campaign funds, not taxpayer dollars." Stefani Carter, July 15, 2011, semi-annual report Stefani Carter, July 15, 2013, semi-annual report: Nick Tran, owner of Margaritas to Go, said by phone that his company rents machines and sets them up for legislators, sometimes in their Capitol offices, "once or twice a year -- it’s never the same." Tran confirmed the 2013 rental of one machine, set up at the Capitol, but said he couldn’t find a record of the 2011 rental, which would have happened before he took over ownership. The 2011 amount, he said, equals the price of two margarita machines and two extra batches of margarita mix. Is it ethical for legislators to serve their staff members margaritas in the Capitol? Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice, a left-leaning group that tracks campaign fundraising, told us by email, "Under current law one can supplement your staff using campaign funds. I see no legal barrier to supplementing them with a tasty margarita. The fundamental test for use of campaign funds is whether they have been converted to ‘personal use’ of you or your family. If only the family came to the party, there might be a problem." By phone, Ian Steusloff, assistant general counsel at the Texas Ethics Commission, directed us to some of the commission’s advisory opinions that might apply: 453, 314, 458, 378, 195. We found opinions that indicated spending campaign money on an office staff party was OK and that liquor being consumed by staffers in a legislator’s office wasn’t a problem in and of itself. In a Nov. 24, 2004, opinion, the commission said a former Texas senator, who had become a U.S. ambassador, could use donations that had been given to his Texas campaign to host a holiday party for his embassy staff. An April 13, 1984, opinion said a legislator could accept "food, liquor, and other beverages (donated) for use in his office during the session" presuming "these items are used by the legislator or the legislator’s staff for such activities as entertaining constituents who visit the legislator's office or for their own consumption." Our ruling Koop said Carter "repeatedly used her campaign contributors’ donations to rent margarita machines for our state house office." That’s misleadingly imprecise. Twice in four years, Carter reported spending campaign money to rent margarita machines for office staff parties; using the word "repeatedly" risks the misimpression that Capitol employees were downing margaritas every other weekend.

pomt-12087	"I think what the authors of the (25th) Amendment principally had in mind was some kind of physical incapacitation or serious mental illness or a breakdown, an inability to function in office."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/29/adam-schiff/when-can-25th-amendment-be-used-against-president/	A Democratic lawmaker who disapproves of President Donald Trump recently suggested the 25th Amendment to the Constitution could provide a solution. "POTUS is showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger," Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., tweeted on Aug. 15. "Time to invoke the 25th Amendment." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But not all Democrats see the 25th amendment as an appropriate way of responding to Trump. Asked whether he thinks it should be used against Trump, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the amendment does not apply to present circumstances. "I think what the authors of the (25th) Amendment principally had in mind was some kind of physical incapacitation or serious mental illness or a breakdown, an inability to function in office," Schiff said Aug. 20 on CNN’s State of the Union. "I think we're still far from concluding that that's the case, even though we find, many of us, his conduct anathema and there to be a serious problem here." For this fact-check, we wanted to know if Schiff’s reading of the amendment’s origins is right. We’re not going to weigh in on whether Trump’s actions or mental state fit the criteria for presidential disability. What does the 25th Amendment say? The 25th Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1967, sought to resolve several thorny issues of presidential and vice presidential power. It creates a succession plan for when these top two positions go vacant. It also allows the president to declare himself unable to fulfill his duties and transfer power to the vice president. However, we’re mostly interested in the 25th Amendment’s fourth and final section, which allows someone other than the president to make a finding of presidential disability. Section four authorizes the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet, or another body as determined by lawmakers, to declare a president "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office." Doing so would then elevate the vice president to the position of acting president. The president can restore his powers by declaring that no inability exists. However, the same body that initially transferred power to the vice president can respond by essentially doubling down on their declaration that the president is unable to discharge his duties. Then, if Congress, by a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate, agrees that the president is unable to serve, the vice president continues to act as president. Such a move could permanently strip a president of his powers — hence, why some legal analysts refer to section four as the "involuntary removal mechanism." What did the authors intend? The push for Congress to formalize a blueprint for handling presidential disability gained traction after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22, 1963 (though lawmakers had first considered it much earlier in American history). "The assassination of President Kennedy ... produced a flurry of additional proposals dealing with the subject," John D. Feerick wrote in a 1995 article in the Wake Forest Law Review. "These proposals were influenced by the sense at that time that, if Kennedy had lived, the country would have had to deal with the problem of presidential inability in a most tragic setting." As congressional hearings unfolded, little controversy surrounded the amendment’s first three sections, according to Feerick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the real debate centered on when someone other than the president could declare him or her to be incapacitated. The amendment’s principal author, Sen. Birch Bayh, D.-Ind., embraced an understanding that presidential inability would encompass both physical and mental inability, said Joel Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University, who’s closely studied the congressional record. The formulation he adopted was put forth by Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., who said presidential inability "involves physical or mental inability to make or communicate his decision regarding his capacity and physical or mental inability to exercise the powers and duties of his office." Another important architect of the amendment, Rep. Richard Poff, R-Va., held a similar view, according to Goldstein. Poff said section four not only applied when the president, due to accident or illness, was unconscious or otherwise unable to make or communicate a decision, but also when "the President, by reason of mental debility, is unable or unwilling to make any rational decision, including particularly the decision to stand aside." On July 6, 1965, Congress formally proposed the 25th Amendment, and the necessary 38 states ratified it Feb. 10, 1967. Legal experts told us the drafters used intentionally vague and open-ended language (i.e., a president who is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.") because they recognized they couldn't predict every scenario in which a president could be deemed disabled. But despite the definition’s fuzziness, Goldstein said "the record makes clear that section four was not intended as a means of removing the president simply because he or she makes an unpopular decision." So did Schiff’s claim that the authors intended to cover physical incapacitation, serious mental illness and a general an inability to function, hit the mark? "I think he’s right, as far as a one-sentence summary could have it," said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University. "They made the process and the terms flexible, but that was what they were mainly thinking of." Our ruling Schiff said, "I think what the authors of the (25th) Amendment principally had in mind was some kind of physical incapacitation or serious mental illness or a breakdown, an inability to function in office." The framers used deliberately broad language to allow for flexibility. But the record clearly shows they intended section four of the 25th Amendment to apply when a president is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office" due to either physical or mental inability, and not principally as a strategy for ousting an unpopular president.

pomt-11114	"National Guard storms Mexico border, makes game-changing impact in just 30 days"	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/07/blog-posting/fact-checking-claim-about-national-guard-border-ap/	A website called Viral WDC said the deployment of the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border allowed immigration officials to arrest "1,600 extra people" trying to cross into the United States illegally. "A major game-changing incident took place after the National Guard stormed the border to protect the immigration laws and defend citizens from having nearly 2,000 people break into America illegally. … Thanks to the National Guard arriving at the border to help lend a hand to the roving tribe of potential illegal immigrants, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were able to arrest 1,600 extra people who were trying to allegedly cross the border illegally," said the May 14 post on Viral WDC, headlined "National Guard storms Mexico border, makes game-changing impact in just 30 days." Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Looking past the bluster of the headline, the story largely checks out. Government officials have credited National Guard troops at the border for contributing to the apprehension of 1,600 people, the capture of about 1,000 pounds of marijuana and 451 "turn backs" of individuals seeking to come into the United States illegally, CNN reported May 9, based on a conference call with CBP and National Guard officials. The Viral WDC story cites a Washington Examiner story that said, "U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have apprehended an additional 1,600 people attempting to illegally enter the country from Mexico since April 15 as a result of the deployment of National Guard troops to the southwest border." Neither Viral WDC nor the Washington Examiner say what the 1,600 number is in addition to. The way the Viral WDC story is written suggests that 1,600 would not have been apprehended if the National Guard wasn’t assisting. But there’s no evidence to support that. CNN said a CBP official "did not have comparison numbers available, so it was not possible to determine if those figures were substantially more than if National Guard troops had not been dispatched to the border." Total apprehensions were up in April compared to March, but border apprehensions have been increasing since February. There were about 37,400 southwest border apprehensions in March, compared to approximately 38,300 in April, according to CBP. President Donald Trump on April 4 issued a memorandum so that the National Guard could help immigration officials stop the illegal entry of immigrants and illicit drugs. It’s important to note that the National Guard is not actually apprehending individuals. Instead, they are carrying out non-enforcement roles, serving as pilots, aerial observers, intelligence analysts, communications specialists, camera operators and vehicle mechanics. Defense Secretary James N. Mattis authorized the use of Defense Department funds to send up to 4,000 National Guard troops to the southern border to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He authorized the deployment through Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year 2018. The troops are deployed under Title 32 duty status, meaning they are under the command and control of their state governors but paid by the federal government and can undertake "Homeland Defense activities." There are now more than 1,800 National Guard troops who deployed starting in early April, U.S. Customs and Border protection spokesman Daniel Hetlage told PolitiFact on June 6. Our ruling A Viral WDC story said, "National Guard storms Mexico border, makes game-changing impact in just 30 days." Officials have said that the deployment of the National Guard to the border has contributed to the apprehension of 1,600 people. The Viral WDC story said the deployment was a "major game-changing incident" and that it allowed the arrest of "1,600 extra people." While the National Guard’s support has enabled more agents to be on the ground to apprehend immigrants, it’s unclear if these are "extra" apprehensions or simply following the previous months’ trend.

pomt-15345	A "working woman" will earn $7.70 on $10.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/10/tom-toles/cartoon-skips-specifics-wage-gap-claim/	As political cartoons go, it was a fairly simple idea. The day after the U.S. Treasury announced that the portrait of a woman would be featured on a redesigned $10, the editorial cartoonist at the Washington Post offered his take. Tom Toles’ cartoon showed a portrait of "U.S. Working Woman" in the center, and the $10 note was worth $7.70. The motto: "Close Enuf 4 U" and signed by "Hugh Ken Wait." The same idea – that women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man makes – has been the subject of repeated claims by politicians, with varying degrees of success. Among the best: a Mostly True rating for a similar claim by U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn last year. Nunn was broad enough to be on point, with some context missing. Among the worst: a Mostly False for that statistic by former President Jimmy Carter, who misread the data to suggest the gap was for equal work. PolitiFact Georgia decided to see how the Pulitzer prizewinner stacked up against the pols. We’ll get into the challenges of the statistics below. ON THE FACE OF IT Just to recap, Alexander Hamilton has graced the $10 since 1929, when the nation’s first secretary replaced Andrew Jackson, the nation’s seventh president, for the honor. Jackson, meanwhile, was moved to the $20 bill and remains the face of that note today. An advocacy group called Women on 20s recently petitioned President Obama and Congress for a woman’s face to be put on paper currency. But treasury officials had already announced that the $10 note would be the next to be redesigned. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in June that he would reveal his choice of the woman who will be on that note by year’s end. The bill will enter circulation in 2020, the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote. DOLLARS AND SENSE Even as we approach that historic milestone, data clearly show that there is a wage gap between men and women. And Toles – like politicians from President Obama down to Connie Stokes, a candidate for lieutenant governor of Georgia – isn’t pulling that 77 percent figure out of thin air. The U.S. Census found in 2010, that the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers was 0.77. Put into dollars, that means women working full-time made 77 cents for every dollar earned by men who worked full time. An updated report for 2012 found the same gap, looking at all male and female full-time workers across the nation, regardless of occupation. The catch: The statistic is based on total wages. The Census report did not account for the fact that men generally work more hours. So the large discrepancy exists in part because it does not examine pay for the same work, or the same number of hours worked. That’s why the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reached a different conclusion of the gap. Its 2012 study analyzed pay by weekly wages and found that women earned 82 cents on the dollar for men’s median weekly earnings. Other BLS data have shown that the gap also diminishes when comparing women and men, in the same exact job, with the same levels of education and experience. In those cases, the gap falls to somewhere in the 91 percent range. So, while all evidence points to a wage gap, the exact difference is between 77 percent and 91 percent, depending on what you want to compare. OUR RULING The cartoon is broad, bluntly showing that "working women" across the nation would earn just $7.70 for a man’s $10. It leaves a lot open to interpretation. There is no implication that the jobs being done by men and women are identical, so Toles avoids the mistake of suggesting the gap is that wide for the same jobs. It’s not. The cartoon is an oversimplification of complex data that has been misread and misused repeatedly. But adding more context would have meant more than a one-panel cartoon. Toles keeps his claim broad enough to fall in line with the U.S. Census studies. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Tom Toles	None	None	None	2015-07-10T00:00:00	2015-06-18	['None']

pomt-08163	Hillsborough's Public Transportation Commission has "a rule that says cabbies have to wear socks. I mean, please. Come on."	true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/02/ronda-storms/ronda-storms-says-local-transit-agency-forces-cab-/	A Republican state senator from Hillsborough County wants to do away with an independent agency that regulates the county's taxicab drivers, saying the agency is duplicative, costly, and rife with inane and unnecessary regulations. Among those regulations, says state Sen. Ronda Storms, a former Hillsborough County commissioner, is a requirement that cab drivers wear socks. Storms says she wants to propose a bill during next spring's state legislative session eliminating the Hillsborough transit agency, formally called the Public Transportation Commission. "They have a rule that says cabbies have to wear socks," Storms said in a Dec. 1, 2010, St. Petersburg Times article. "I mean, please. Come on." This fact check is about feet. (A PolitiFact Florida first). But before we get to the bottom of it all, a little background on the Public Transportation Commission. The commission was created in 1976 by the state Legislature to establish a countywide taxicab regulatory agency and to unify different taxicab ordinances created by the cities of Tampa, Temple Terrace and Plant City. In 1982, the Legislature added vans, limousines and transportation for the handicapped to the commission's regulatory scope. In 1987, basic life support ambulances and government wreckers came under the commission's purview. The seven-member transportation board is made up of county commissioners and city representatives from Tampa, Plant City and Temple Terrace. It's the only agency of its kind in the state. And it's had its share of troubles. Over the years, the commission has been criticized for hiring an executive director that didn't meet job requirements, paying a lobbyist who had worked as a campaign consultant for the commission's board chairman, and forcing a free electric shuttle service out of business. Storms told the St. Petersburg Times that the agency's most important functions, like making sure vehicles for hire are safe and drivers aren't a danger to passengers, can be handled by the Hillsborough County staff. The agency is funded entirely by fees paid by drivers and taxicab companies. It does have interlocal agreements with the county to pay for legal services, however. And Storms says since the agency was created by the state, state workers must spend time monitoring the agency's activities. "It makes good sense to me. It's what we stand for as Republicans. Less government, more efficiency, more streamlining. It's what the voters want," she said of her bill. "What is it that they're doing to justify the additional layer of government?" Audie Canney, Storm's legislative aide, said Storm found the sock requirement in the Public Transportation Commission's rules for taxi drivers. In Section 6, under driver duties, the agency articulates a dress code for male and female drivers. 6.7.1 The driver, if male shall wear clean trousers or knee-length hemmed shorts, shoes and socks and a shirt with a collar, with or without a tie, Appropriate clean outer garments may be worn, if desired, over the collared shirt. Luxury taxicab and limousine drivers shall wear a collared shirt with tie (with or without jacket), trousers, socks and dress shoes. 6.7.2 The driver, if female must wear clean trousers or knee-length hemmed shorts, slacks, shoes and an appropriate collar. Appropriate clean outer garments may be worn, if desired, over the collared shirt or blouse. Female luxury taxicab and limousine drivers must wear a collared shirt or blouse, with or without a tie, with or without a jacket, dress slacks or mid-calf hemmed skirt, socks/nylons and closed toed dress shoes. Later, the dress code says wearing "sandals, or any type of open-toed footwear" is prohibited. In reading the rules, we noted that it's clear that male drivers are supposed to wear socks, but there is no such requirement for female drivers. So we turned to the Public Transportation Commission's interim executive director, Cesar Padilla, who has worked for the commission since 2000. He said the dress code rule has developed over the years. But here's how he explained it to us. "The taxi drivers have to have collared shirts, if they wear shorts, the have to be hemmed up," Padilla said. "They cannot wear open-toed shoes, no flip-flops and they must wear socks. That's one of the many rules there." So socks are a must. Padilla said the rules are in place to make passengers feel comfortable. "When a person comes into Tampa International Airport and they get into a taxi, that's the first impression they're going to have of this area," he said. He also said dress codes are common for agencies that regulate taxicabs, so he wasn't sure what the big deal was about. And we did find several municipalities and governments that have dress codes in place for taxicab drivers. Miami-Dade County's dress code is a collared shirt, slacks and closed toe shoes. In Orlando, men must wear pants while females "may wear skirts or dresses providing that the hem is not more than two (2) inches above the top of the knee joint and is not strapless or halter type." Drivers must wear a collared shirt with sleeves and shoes and socks, except that "females may wear (open-toed) footwear providing that such footwear is high-heeled and is not clogs, thongs, shower shoes or sandals." In Daytona Beach, "neither a male or female driver is permitted to wear a T-shirt, tank top, body suit, swimwear or jogging suit as an outer garment, nor sandals or other type of open footwear, or ballcaps." But that's a side note to the claim we're checking. Storms put her foot down when it comes to Hillsborough's Public Transportation Commission, saying some of its regulations are unnecessary and inane, specifically a requirement that taxicab drivers wear socks. She's right that cab drivers have a dress code that includes socks, but it's not as uncommon as she makes it sounds. Still, on the facts she's right. We say True.

pomt-10405	"Obama voted to support President Bush between 40 and 50 percent of the time over the past two years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/04/john-mccain/obama-and-bush-found-common-ground/	On the campaign trail, Sen. Barack Obama regularly criticizes President Bush's "failed policies" and leadership abilities. On the floor of the Senate, however, the freshman from Illinois is much less contrary than his rhetoric would suggest. Responding to Obama's criticisms of Sen. John McCain's 95 percent presidential support score in 2007, McCain's campaign on June 3, 2008, sent a mass e-mail noting that Obama's own presidential support score is higher than one might think. The e-mail cited vote studies compiled by Congressional Quarterly to note that Obama voted to support President Bush's positions between 40 and 50 percent of the time over the past two years. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers also noted that Obama voted with his party more than 95 percent of the time during that period, while McCain was more independent, tallying party unity scores between 70 and 90 percent. "Can you imagine Obama touting his record of supporting President Bush half the time? Well, it's true by his numbers," Rogers said. McCain's campaign is correct on both counts. Though Obama is a loyal Democrat who has opposed Bush on legislation more often than the average for his party in the Senate, running for president hasn't made him significantly more partisan. He opposed Bush 51 percent of the time in 2006 and 60 percent of the time in 2007. In 2007, Obama found himself in Bush's camp on immigration policy; in a series of votes, Obama backed legislation, which failed, that would have provided a temporary guest worker program and new border security measures. Obama and Bush also were allied on legislation that raised the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour over two years and provided $8.3-billion in small-business tax incentives. In 2006, as Obama was laying the foundation for his presidential bid, he supported the president's position on key votes dealing with immigration policy and on making permanent 14 provisions in the "Patriot Act" antiterrorism law. All of which hardly makes Obama a full-blown Bush supporter. But his record also doesn't put him near the Senate's top 10 Bush foes — a list headed in 2007 by Democrats Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Barbara Boxer of California, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, who each were opposed to Bush more than 65 percent of the time. Because Obama has shown a willingness to vote the administration's position on a number of occasions over the past two years, we rule the McCain campaign's claim True.

pomt-12205	"Over $13 million worth of crops have ROTTED in California, all because no one is willing to work jobs vacated by migrants."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/24/blog-posting/13-million-crops-rotted-calif-because-no-one-wante/	A news story about California farmers losing money because of a labor shortage has drawn attention on Facebook because it lays the blame on President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. A June 28, 2017, post on LeftScoop.com ran under the headline, "Over $13 million worth of crops have ROTTED in California, all because no one is willing to work jobs vacated by migrants." The link has been shared more than 90,000 times in three weeks. Facebook users flagged the story as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media giant’s efforts to combat fake news. In this case, the story isn’t fake. But it’s not accurate, either. The post is largely comprised almost entirely of uncredited passages from two legitimate news sources. It then adds anti-Trump sentiment for effect. We emailed the website that created the post, LeftScoop.com, to ask about the post and why the site did not include its sources but didn’t get a reply. The post was removed shortly after our inquiry. Understanding the story The LeftScoop.com article starts by using several slightly edited paragraphs from a June 22 story from the Santa Barbara Independent, a weekly alternative newspaper based in Santa Barbara, Calif. "Labor shortage leaves $13 million in crops to rot in fields," the newspaper article’s headline read. The LeftScoop.com post also borrows from a 2017 Mother Jones article. The Independent’s story said that the county’s agricultural industry has suffered labor shortages from 15 to 26 percent annually for five consecutive years. It cited Grower-Shipper Association of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties statistics that said $13 million worth of strawberries, broccoli and other produce were plowed under, up from $4.4 million worth five years ago. Other outlets have cited the Independent story when writing about the subject. LeftScoop.com’s post implied Trump was largely to blame for the lost crops because he had scared off Mexican migrant workers with his tough policies, causing the labor shortages. That’s wrong. Claire Wineman, the Grower-Shipper Association’s president, told us Santa Barbara County has been experiencing the same lack of workers felt by agricultural areas across California and the United States. The dollar figure in the story came from an annual survey the Grower-Shipper Association sent to local farmers, asking them to quantify how much gross revenue they estimated they had lost due to a lack of a sufficient number of field workers. The total from 68 respondents amounted to $13.5 million for the 2015 calendar year. Trump took office Jan. 20, 2017. "We absolutely have been experiencing labor shortages over the last few years," Wineman said. The Independent’s story, she said, did a fair job of describing the reasons, which go back years before Trump took office. One thing the Independent story (and therefore the LeftScoop.com post) did misrepresent was in the headline, Wineman said. The survey didn’t determine whether the crops went unharvested and rotted in the fields. "We didn’t survey what happened, we only asked how much revenue was not realized because of a lack of workers," Wineman said. "We just don’t know that." Our ruling LeftScoop.com said, "Over $13 million worth of crops have ROTTED in California, all because no one is willing to work jobs vacated by migrants." The post, which has since been removed, is almost entirely copied from uncredited articles from two more reputable news outlets. There is a labor shortage in central California’s agricultural corridor, but that $13 million is just for Santa Barbara County, not the whole state, as was implied. The association that determined the total also noted there was no data on whether the crops had really been left to rot in fields. The dollar figure was measured through a survey of farmers’ potential lost revenue. As for the reasons for the shortage, LeftScoop.com drastically oversimplifies the issue in the text by interjecting that Trump’s immigration policies are to blame for a lack of migrant workers. For starters, the data is from 2015, more than a year before Trump became president. This post is partially accurate, but not much more. We rate it Half True.

pomt-08949	"Recent data showed Nevada ranks 50th in the money received from" the stimulus bill.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/23/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-ad-attacking-reid-stimulus-use/	One of the most closely watched U.S. Senate races of the year is the match-up between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Reid, the Senate's most powerful member, faces Republican Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favorite. In mid-July, American Crossroads -- a group that's the brainchild of top Republican officials including Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie, both former strategists for President George W. Bush -- released one of the latest in a string of hard-hitting ads in the race. The ad said, "It's bad enough that Nevada has the highest unemployment in the nation. And Harry Reid claims to be helping the jobs situation. Really Harry? Recent data showed Nevada ranks 50th in the money received from Harry's stimulus bill. Thats right. Senate Leader Harry Reid has gotten his own state less help than every other state but one. Along with bailouts, deficits and Obama care, that's what Harry Reid's done for Nevada. Really, Harry? That's not the kind of help Nevada needs." We thought it would be worth checking to see whether Nevada really ranks 50th in aid from President Barack Obama's economic stimulus bill. Tracking down the source of the claim was easy: The ad includes an on-air citation of a Las Vegas Review-Journal story. But we sat bolt upright when we saw the story's date: Feb. 23, 2009. No, not Feb. 23, 2010. The ad said Feb. 23, 2009. That's less than two weeks after Congress passed the massive bill -- not exactly "recent" in our view. Seeking more details, we looked at the story itself. It's a comprehensive article by staff reporter Molly Ball that outlined how Nevada ranked in per capita stimulus aid overall (50th of 51, counting the District of Columbia), as well as for education (51st), transportation (48th), and Medicaid assistance (47th). Because we couldn't find any official document on the Internet that confirmed Nevada's 50th-place rating, we contacted Ball. She said that she calculated the numbers herself using data provided to her at the time. The article cites numerous sources, including the Nevada State Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, the journalistic outfit ProPublica, the Democratic Policy Committee and CNNMoney.com. It also explains that a large part of the reason why Nevada was poised to receive comparatively little funding was that federal dollars from the stimulus are pegged in part to what the state already pays for programs such as Medicaid, which are low compared to many other states. The rankings attracted attention at the time. A March 1, 2009, column in the Review-Journal's competitor, the Las Vegas Sun, picked up on the raw-deal-on-the-stimulus theme and quoted a spokesman for Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons saying, "The governor was surprised and a little disappointed we didn’t receive more in the stimulus package for the state." So we can understand why American Crossroads used these figures. But was it appropriate to describe them as "recent"? We don't think so. The Obama Administration has made significant efforts to collect and publicize data on where stimulus dollars are going through the website Recovery.gov, run by a congressionally created board independent of the administration. (The Recovery Board collects the data from recipients via FederalReporting.gov,) So we turned to Recovery.gov for the most up-to-date data. There's a state-by-state breakdown that lists "funds available," which is defined as "funds set aside for release to a recipient either immediately or in the future." Through July 15, 2010 -- 17 months more recent than the article cited in the ad -- almost $3.2 billion had been set aside for Nevada, about double the amount calculated by the Review-Journal in early 2009. To make an apples-to-apples comparison to the figure cited in the ad, we calculated stimulus funds per capita, by dividing every state's dollar total by its population. Using this measurement, Nevada actually ranked almost exactly in the middle of all states -- 26th from the top. There's also a breakdown for "funds paid out" to date. Using this measurement, Nevada has received $2.2 billion, which is even better -- Nevada ranks 16th highest nationally, or well above average. When we asked American Crossroads for comment, spokesman Jonathan Collegio said that it's legitimate to fault Reid based on the original Review-Journal statistics, which reflected the bill immediately after it left his chamber. "When the Senate Majority leader brags about all the power and the prestige he brings Nevada, while not actually getting anything for Nevada in the stimulus bill he controlled, he has neglected his home state," Collegio said. We'll grant that there are a lot of different ways to make this kind of calculation. An ongoing study by ProPublica, an investigative journalism outlet that has tracked stimulus data, found that Nevada ranks 9th from the bottom, using data that is several months older (and possibly different from) than what is found on recovery.gov. Even recovery.gov offers various types of data that can be sliced and diced to produce state rankings. So the authors of the ad had no shortage of data to choose from. It's not surprising that American Crossroads would reach for the most unflattering number, and if they'd framed it carefully -- for instance, saying that the state ranked 50th "in one study" -- they would have scored passably on our Truth-O-Meter. However, American Crossroads not only cherry-picked the most damning data but also tried to pass it off as "recent." Current data would have showed that Nevada's stimulus haul was no smaller than about average by national standards. This is not a trivial omission, so we rate the ad False.

pomt-06760	Scientists are "questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-more-and-more-scientists-are-quest/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry has made it clear he doesn't believe that human beings are contributing to global warming, and he expounded on the issue in detail at a campaign stop in Bedford, N.H. "I do believe that the issue of global warming has been politicized," Perry said. "I think there are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects. I think we're seeing it almost weekly or even daily, scientists who are coming forward and questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change." He added that plans to address climate change by limiting carbon emissions would cost "billions, if not trillions" and that America should not spend that much money on "scientific theory that has not been proven and from my perspective is more and more being put into question." Perry is the latest candidate to enter the race for the Republican nomination for president, announcing on Aug. 13, 2011, that he is running. Perry has served as the Texas governor since 2000. So is Perry correct? Is there significant disagreement on the causes of global warming? We looked at this question in some detail in a previous fact-check on candidate Tim Pawlenty, who has since dropped out of the race. Pawlenty said, "The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it's fair to say the science is in dispute." We rated that statement False. This report reviews much of the same evidence. We'll start with the basics. One of the most oft-cited reports is from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. It includes the scientific consensus of thousands of researchers from 194 countries. "Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations," the most recent report states. "The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone." (External forcing refers to anything outside of the normal climate system that changes the climate, including the results of human activity, sunspots or volcanic eruptions.) In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC's conclusions: "Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities." Earlier this year, a committee organized by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences again reviewed the current research on climate change. The committee concluded that climate change is occurring, that it is caused primarily by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities, and that it poses significant risks for a range of human and natural systems. It specifically rejected the view that that those findings are in some way questionable. "Although the scientific process is always open to new ideas and results, the fundamental causes and consequences of climate change have been established by many years of scientific research, are supported by many different lines of evidence, and have stood firm in the face of careful examination, repeated testing, and the rigorous evaluation of alternative theories and explanations," the committee said. We asked the Perry campaign for comment on this, but we didn't hear back. In response to similar questions from the Washington Post, the Perry campaign pointed to various writings questioning climate change. But the Post's report noted these writings were anecdotal and "not evidence of the groundswell of opposition suggested by Perry." We concur. To be clear, we're not saying that no scientists -- as in zero -- dispute climate change is caused by human activity. We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCC's conclusions on global warming. Generally speaking, even these scientists do not claim that humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures. Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points. They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whether other human activities contribute as well. They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whether significant changes to public policy are necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures. Climate change skeptics also have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by 31,000 signers opposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or even proving that all the signatories exist. Several scientific studies have attempted to quantify just how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change. A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences -- the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences -- found that out of 1,372 climate researchers under review, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change. It also concluded that "the relative climate expertise and scientiﬁc prominence" of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are "substantially below that of the convinced researchers." An earlier survey published in the 2009 issue of Eos -- a publication of the American Geophysical Union -- asked scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146): "Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?" Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes. Perry also charged that scientists have been manipulating data. He could be referring to a 2009 incident when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data. But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including investigations by the British Parliament, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania State University and the InterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that, while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. Some of the investigations recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data. Perry's remarks give the impression that the science of global warming is in dispute, that some scientists feel one way, and some scientists feel another way. He says that skepticism is growing. In fact, our research shows that's not the case. We found that there is solid consensus among the major scientific organizations and that the skeptics seems to be small minority. We rate his statement False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-08-22T14:03:45	2011-08-17	['None']
pomt-12097	Says Kelli Ward hosted a town hall on "chemtrail conspiracy theories" and is open to sponsoring chemtrails legislation.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/25/senate-leadership-fund/no-kelli-ward-isnt-chemtrails-conspiracy-theorist/	A pro-Republican super PAC with close ties to Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., launched an attack ad against U.S. Senate candidate Kelli Ward, R-Ariz., portraying her as a conspiracy theorist. The Arizona Senate race is picking up national attention after President Donald Trump criticized incumbent Sen. Jeff Flake as "weak on crime & border!" on Twitter. A pro-Trump super PAC is spending $20,000 on Ward, who has cribbed the president’s style in her campaign to "make Arizona great again." The physician served two terms in the Arizona state Senate and lost a 2016 challenge for Sen. John McCain’s seat. The McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund is stepping up for Flake with a 77-second video that knocked Ward as "Chemtrail Kelli" four times. "Ward wasted your tax dollars for a town hall on chemtrail conspiracy theories," the attack ad posted Aug. 22, 2017, says. "Sponsoring chemtrail legislation? ‘I’m open, I introduce legislation for constituents all the time.’ About another chemtrail town hall? ‘I’ll do it again. Of course I’ll do it again.’ Chemtrail Kelli’s got her head in the clouds with crazy ideas." We decided to take a closer look at the links the video made between Ward and chemtrails. The video is correct in saying that Ward hosted a town hall on the issue. But the ad ignores her record of saying she does not believe in the theory. Ward's chemtrail comments in context In the conspiracy world, chemtrails are chemical or biological agents dispersed by aircrafts as part of a government plot to control the weather and human behavior. But scientists generally agree that the cloud-like formations that linger in an aircraft’s trail are basically condensation marks. In June 2014, Ward invited constituents of her state Senate district to a small, informational seminar on chemtrails by two Arizona Department of Environmental Quality staffers in Kingman, Ariz. Some audience members then provided testimony and asked questions of the staffers and Ward. "The town hall was conducted in response to constituent concerns, and experts were brought in to directly refute those concerns," Ward’s spokeswoman Jennifer Lawrence said. The ad plucked quotes that made Ward seem like a conspiracy theorist herself. The full quote from her closing remarks at the town hall about being "open" to sponsoring legislation to investigate chemtrails is more nuanced. "With this particular issue I think it’s going to be very difficult because, unless you get away from the chemtrail issue that you all are so passionate about, talking about our environmental quality I think can go further in terms of making sure that there aren’t any public health issues that are out there with our water, our soil, or our air," Ward said. Ward has repeatedly said she doesn’t subscribe to this belief. "I don’t believe in the chemtrail theory," she told Politico in 2015. She explained in a 2016 radio interview that she considers it her duty as an elected official to respond to her constituents. The attack ad singled out a snippet of the interview of Ward. "About another chemtrail town hall?" the video asks. "I’ll do it again. Of course I’ll do it again." Again, a later part of the interview talks about the need to listen to constituents. "People say, well, would you do it again? Of course I'll do it again because that’s what you’re supposed to do when you’re elected," Ward said. "You’re supposed to listen to the people and you’re supposed to get them the information that they need to feel confident that they live in a safe environment." Our ruling A Senate Leadership Fund ad said Ward hosted a town hall on chemtrails and was willing to sponsor legislation on it. Calling Ward "Chemtrail Kelli" repeatedly and saying she has her "head in the clouds with crazy ideas" wrongly suggests she believes in the conspiracy theory. Ward did host a town hall on chemtrails, but she has not expressed belief in chemtrails. She has not held further town halls or sponsored any legislation on the topic.

pomt-02103	Dan Branch "once lobbied for the AFL-CIO."	false	/texas/statements/2014/may/15/ken-paxton/dan-branch-registered-lobby-ohio-union-not-afl-cio/	State Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney maintains his opponent for the Republican attorney general nomination has lobbied for the biggest labor union organization in America. A news story posted online by the Dallas Morning News on May 11, 2014, quoted Paxton’s campaign spokesman, Anthony Holm, promising attacks based on state Rep. Dan Branch’s legislative actions, including the Dallas lawyer’s supposed advocacy of third-trimester abortions, a charge we earlier found faulty. The story further quoted Holm as saying Branch "once lobbied on behalf of the AFL-CIO," the traditionally Democratic-leaning federation that says it brings together 56 unions representing 12.5 million working men and women. The acronym stands for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. By email, Holm responded to our request for backup information by guiding us to a Jan. 23, 2002, lobbying registration filing with the clerk of the U.S House by Winstead Sechrest & Minick, the Dallas-rooted firm (now called Winstead PC) where Branch is a shareholder. In the filing, the firm said it was representing the Paper Allied-Industrial Chemical & Energy (PACE) International Union. The filing lists individuals expected to lobby as Frederick McClure and Branch, identified as shareholders, and Brigham McCown, a firm associate. The filing’s second page lists under "lobbying issues" the U.S. Department of Energy "enhanced facilities." By phone, Holm said the union represented by the firm later merged with the United Steelworkers, who are affiliated with the AFL-CIO. On April 14, 2005, according to the history page on the steelworkers’ union website, its union merged with the PACE International Union to form the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (USW). "With more than 850,000 active members in over 8,000 bargaining units in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, the combined union is the dominant union in paper, forestry products, steel, aluminum, tire and rubber, mining, glass, chemicals, petroleum and other basic resource industries," the web page says. Lynne Hancock, a Pittsburgh-based national USW spokesperson, told us by phone that the PACE was affiliated with the AFL-CIO. We asked Branch’s campaign about Branch’s lobbying registration, drawing an email from Branch spokesman Enrique Marquez stating the AFL-CIO hasn’t been a Winstead client. On behalf of the Winstead firm, spokeswoman Shannon Tipton emailed a similar not-so. The emails from Marquez and Tipton each had vague descriptions of the firm's work for the PACE union; Tipton said the law firm engaged in "transactional work with respect to investments or federal regulatory work before the" U.S. Department of Energy. Marquez said the firm’s PACE work focused on energy department facilities. In Austin, spokesman Ed Sills of the Texas AFL-CIO responded to our inquiry by saying no one in its office had a memory of Branch’s involvement in a PACE issue. By phone, Sill said it’s inaccurate to say Branch lobbied for the federation if he was registered to lobby solely for an affiliate. "Say IBM belongs to the chamber of commerce," Sills said. "We don’t say you’re lobbying for the chamber of commerce" if your client is IBM. After we asked for an interview with Branch, we fielded a phone call from McCown, the third lawyer listed on the Winstead lobbying registration. McCown, saying he’d been contacted by the campaign about our inquiries, told us he connected the firm to an Ohio PACE union local that wanted help in Washington, D.C., where former Texas Gov. George W. Bush was then president, toward preserving a uranium-enrichment facility near Piketon, Ohio, which McCown described as about 40 miles from his boyhood home. Branch played a minimal role on behalf of the union, McCown said, maybe attending a White House meeting. For the union's perspective, we turned back to Hancock, who put us in touch with the former president of the Ohio union local, Daniel Minter of Waverly, Ohio. Minter echoed McCown’s account, adding that the Winstead firm advised the union as it successfully sought federal help creating new missions and jobs on the site of the Ohio plant, where enrichment was ceasing. During the engagement, Minter said, he talked "very infrequently" with Branch. Minter said he didn’t recall any AFL-CIO involvement. Our ruling Paxton said Branch once lobbied on behalf of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella group for dozens of unions. Branch registered to lobby in Washington, D.C., in 2002 for a union affiliated with the labor federation that sought federal help preserving jobs near an Ohio facility that was otherwise shutting down. Whatever precise role Branch played for the union, there's no evidence he lobbied for the AFL-CIO. Mark this claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-15069	"The birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/23/donald-trump/hillary-clinton-obama-birther-fact-check/	Call it ricochet politics. First, a questioner at a New Hampshire rally for Donald Trump repeats the lie that President Barack Obama is a Muslim. Trump fails to correct him and faces a round of questions as to why he didn’t. Then the host of NBC’s Meet the Press asks Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson if it would be okay to have a Muslim president and Carson said, "I absolutely would not agree with that." This prompts Hillary Clinton to tweet, "Can a Muslim be President of the United States of America? In a word: Yes. Now let's move on." Then Trump responds with a tweet of his own. "Just remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!" The birther movement refers to the long-running myth that Obama was not born in the United States and thus, under the Constitution, could not be president. Trump promoted this belief avidly for several years with anyone who would listen. This week, Trump told Late Show host Stephen Colbert that he doesn’t "talk about it anymore." Did Clinton not just start the birther movement but back it wholeheartedly by being "all in"? The paper trail The allegation about Obama’s birthplace tracks back to the bruising 2008 Democratic primary between Obama and Clinton. According to a Telegraph article, as early as April 2008, a Clinton supporter passed around an email that questioned where Obama was born. "Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy," it said. "She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth." The cry that Obama was not a legitimate candidate grew much louder in June 2008. On June 7, 2008, Clinton conceded and called for all Democrats to rally behind Obama. Some in her party did not care to listen. By June 10, 2008, opponents to Obama were posting on a website called Pumaparty.com. PUMA stood for Party Unity My Ass. The website encouraged frustrated Clinton supporters to back the Republican nominee. John Avlon, editor-in-chief of the Daily Beast, explored the roots of the birther movement in his book Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America. Avlon described a posting on the PUMA website with the heading "Obama May Be Illegal to Be Elected President!" He wrote that a Clinton volunteer in Texas, Linda Starr, played a key role in spreading the rumor. Starr connected with Pennsylvania attorney Philip Berg in August and Berg followed up by suing in federal court to block Obama’s nomination. The suit was thrown out repeatedly on the grounds that Berg lacked standing and the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately refused to hear his appeal. There is no record that Clinton herself or anyone within her campaign ever advanced the charge that Obama was not born in the United States. A review by our fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org reported that no journalist who investigated this ever found a connection to anyone in the Clinton organization. Clinton, herself, answered this very accusation after Trump's tweet during an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon. Lemon asked Clinton if she started smear campaigns that Obama was born outside the United States. "That is – no. That is so ludicrous, Don. You know, honestly, I just believe that, first of all, it’s totally untrue, and secondly, you know, the president and I have never had any kind of confrontation like that," Clinton said. "You know, I have been blamed for nearly everything, that was a new one to me." We should note that the birther rumor is distinct from the myth about Obama’s religion, which is what got the ball rolling at the Trump event in New Hampshire. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton started the birther movement and "was all in." It’s an interesting bit of history that the birther movement appears to have begun with Democrats supporting Clinton and opposing Obama. But Trump, and others who have made this claim, neglect to mention that there is no direct tie to Clinton or her 2008 campaign. The story appears to have started with supporters of Clinton, an important distinction. Trump goes on to completely distort the chain of events by claiming Clinton "was all in" on the birther movement. Most of the talk started after Clinton suspended her presidential campaign. And the only thing she officially has ever done is deny any accusation of starting a whisper campaign. We rate this claim False.

pomt-06607	Says Rick Perry "provided in-state tuition... for illegal immigrants."	true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/22/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-rick-perry-provided-state-colle/	At the Sept. 22, 2011, Fox News-Google debate in Orlando, Mitt Romney expanded on his disagreement with a Texas law affording some illegal immigrants in-state tuition to public colleges and universities. Fox News reporter Chris Wallace noted that Romney had vetoed such a proposal when he was governor of Massachusetts. Wallace then asked: "What about Gov. (Rick) Perry's argument that it's better to get these kids an education and to get them jobs than to consign them just to being a burden on the state?" "It's an argument I just can't follow," Romney replied. "I've got be honest with you, I don't see how it is that a state like Texas -- to go to the University of Texas, if you're an illegal alien, you get an in-state tuition discount." In advance of the debate, we were reviewing another presidential aspirant’s claim about the Texas law. In the Sept. 12 debate in Tampa, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum said Perry had "provided in-state tuition for -- for illegal immigrants. Maybe that was an attempt to attract the illegal vote -- I mean, the Latino voters. But you attract Latino voters by talking about the importance of immigration in this country." Setting aside whether Santorum equated illegal immigrants with Latino Americans, did Perry give a tuition break to people who are in the U.S. illegally? Perry responded: "In the state of Texas, if you've been in the state of Texas for three years, if you're working towards your college degree, and if you are working and pursuing citizenship in the state of Texas, you pay in-state tuition there. ... And I'm proud that we are having those individuals be contributing members of our society rather than telling them, ‘You go be on the government dole.’ " Indeed, as we noted in a 2010 fact check, Perry proudly signed into law on June 16, 2001, a proposal allowing certain illegal immigrants to attend Texas colleges and universities at in-state tuition rates. Undocumented immigrants with a Texas high school diploma or GED who have lived in Texas for at least three years may qualify for in-state tuition if they sign an affidavit saying they intend to apply for permanent residency as soon as they can. From 2002 to 2010, according to the coordinating board, 35,200 students used the affidavit method to attend Texas colleges or universities at in-state tuition rates.The annual number of beneficiaries rose from 733 in 2002 to 16,476 in 2010, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. And "affidavit" students pay far less than what they’d pay as non-residents. On average in 2011, a non-resident, full-time student would be expected to pay an estimated $17,000 in tuition and fees, according to Texas public universities, while an in-state resident would be paying $7,200. Texas isn’t alone with such a provision. Nationally, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 13 states passed such proposals into law in the wake of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Signed by President Clinton, the act sought to prevent states from giving an in-state tuition benefit to illegal immigrants that is not available to legal residents. Legislatures in Texas, California and other states responded with measures intended to preserve in-state tuition for some illegal immigrants. Other states banned illegal immigrants from getting in-state tuition rates; Indiana passed such a law last month, as the Indianapolis Star reported Aug. 31. In Texas, lawmakers approved House Bill 1403 with few "no" votes. After signing it into law, Perry said in a speech to the Southwest Voters Registration Education Project that he approved it "so that young Texans who graduated from our public schools, regardless of their immigration status, will be able to pay in‑state tuition and take part in the Texas Dream. We want bright, new Texans to stay here, and contribute great things to our future." Six years later, Perry opposed an attempt to repeal the measure, telling the Houston Chronicle: "I’m for leaving the law like it is because I think it serves a good purpose." He reiterated his support during the 2010 Texas gubernatorial campaign. Perry’s comments at the Sept. 12 and Sept. 22 debates aligned with his previously supportive statements. All told, Perry isn’t solely responsible for the Texas law enabling illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition, but he signed it into existence and has stood by it.

pomt-13052	Says Donald Trump said he intends "to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling" during the campaign.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/nov/22/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-donald-trump-intends-expand-oil-d/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson spent the week after the 2016 election fighting against a bill that would have steered more royalties from oil drilling to some Gulf states. Nelson’s state of Florida already bans offshore oil drilling near its coasts. But Nelson feared that by dangling more royalties, state leaders would be more open to drilling near Florida in the future. In a speech on the Senate floor Nov. 16, Nelson said President-elect Donald Trump’s position on the issue is concerning to environmentalists. "Ever since I was a young congressman, I’ve been fighting to keep oil rigs off of Florida’s coast," he said, "and now it's especially important at this time as we have a new administration coming in that took a public position in the election declaring the president-elect's intent to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling." The American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016, sponsored by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., failed to get enough Senate votes to move forward on Nov. 17. But the future of oil drilling along coasts in Florida and the United States will remain a hot topic of conversation under Trump’s administration and potentially in Nelson’s re-election campaign in 2018. Here we will look at Trump’s position on opening up additional coastal areas to drill for oil. We heard back from Nelson’s office but not from Trump’s transition team. Donald Trump’s campaign position oil drilling Trump generally spoke in favor of offshore oil drilling during the campaign, although his position wasn’t always clear. He sounded skeptical about a proposal in Congress to allow offshore drilling closer to Florida in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times in February. "They've already got plenty in the Gulf," Trump said. "It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing." In 2006, Congress -- with input and support from Nelson -- passed a bill to ban oil drilling within 125 miles off much of Florida’s coast and up to 235 miles at some points. The ban is set to expire in 2022. In 2015, Cassidy introduced the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act, which would allow drilling 50 miles off Florida’s Gulf shores. In response, Nelson filed a bill to extend the ban by five years. Neither bill reached a Senate vote. Trump was more forceful about his support for drilling since that time in speeches and press releases that we found through our own research and in Trump’s statements sent to us by Nelson’s Senate spokesman. During the campaign, Trump’s America First Energy Plan called for opening up onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands, eliminating a moratorium on coal leasing, and opening shale energy deposits. Trump called for unleashing "America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves." In a May 2016 speech to the North Dakota Petroleum Council, Trump said that in his first 100 days in office, he would "lift moratoriums on energy production in federal area. We’re going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies. These technologies create millions of jobs with a smaller footprint than ever before." He reiterated those views during a September 2016 speech at the 2016 Shale Insight Conference. Trump’s position has remained the same since he won After Trump won Nov. 8, his transition team posted an energy policy that stated the administration will open onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands and waters and streamline the permitting process for all energy projects. A few days after Trump won, one of his economic advisers, Stephen Moore, told NPR that Trump’s administration believes it can raise "hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years" by opening up more federal lands for leases for oil and gas development and coal development. On Nov. 18, the Obama administration took the opposite approach, banning offshore drilling in the Arctic as part of a new five-year plan for energy development in federal waters. Trump won’t be able to instantly toss Obama’s ban. His administration will have to prepare a report which could take as long as two years, and then the federal government would have to organize a sale of leases for companies that want to drill there, the Washington Post reported. Although Trump wants more drilling, he may have to wait years for it. CNBC reported that Trump’s plan to expand oil drilling probably won’t happen until his successor is in the White House. Reasons for delay include the years it takes to start projects, local and state governments sometimes oppose drilling, and market forces. Our ruling Nelson said that Trump said during the campaign he intends "to open up additional areas off the coast to oil drilling." In official campaign and transition team statements, Trump repeatedly has called for making it easier to drill for oil. He called for opening offshore areas and reducing "unnecessary restrictions." Since he won, Trump’s administration has reiterated its pro-drilling stance. He hasn't been so clear about his specific plans for Florida. In one interview, he appeared skeptical about expanding offshore drilling closer to Florida. He is limited in the extent that he could expand drilling anywhere near Florida’s coasts because current law bans it within at least 125 miles. With that caveat, we rate Nelson’s point Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5e60a6c4-1a0c-4d16-916c-7a861d04b26a	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2016-11-22T12:04:49	2016-11-16	['None']

"The DEA just raided a United States senator — Dems in a panic," read the headline on a June 10, 2017, post on NewsFeedHunter.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media website’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The post says U.S. Sen. Hal Lindsay, D-N.J., owned a Wyoming ranch that was just raided by the agency, which seized "more than 400 marijuana plants, 2 greenhouses full of opium-producing poppies and a small lab that was pumping out massive amounts of refined, finished product." The story said Lindsay was released on $10 million bail and faced more than 70 years in prison just for the opium. Except Lindsay isn’t in any trouble, because he doesn’t exist. New Jersey’s two senators are Democrats Cory Booker and Bob Menendez. There also was no bust, because the story was made up and posted on June 10 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site run by Christopher Blair, a fake news operator whom we have profiled in the past. TheLastLineOfDefense.org runs fake news stories written by Blair in an attempt to fool conservative readers. These stories often are posted on other websites without attribution or indication they are fake. The site’s disclaimer said that it "is a satirical publication that may sometimes appear to be telling the truth. We assure you that’s not the case. We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist." The story about the drug bust continued on Blair’s website, with the fictional Lindsay agreeing in a followup story also posted on June 10 to flip on his business partner, Lester Malroney. The saga telegraphed it’s contrived premise, calling Malroney "an obviously fictitious name" and suddenly referred to Lindsay as a senator from Wyoming, not just having a ranch in Wyoming (the state’s senators are actually Republicans Mike Enzi and John Barrasso). The fictitious saga led to the pretend senator's death and more, including implicating Chelsea Clinton and tying the DEA raid to a previous fake yarn about the Clinton Foundation smuggling contraband and refugees. We attempted to reach NewsFeedHunter.com through their website contact form to ask if they knew the story was fake, but didn’t receive a reply. The site’s registration information is private.

pomt-12763	"Midland, Texas, now beats the San Francisco area in the percentage of jobs created by startups."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/feb/24/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-claim-touting-midland-over-san-francis/	Gov. Greg Abbott closed January 2017 by telling lawmakers that Texas not only leads the nation in oil and gas, it’s enjoying an "innovation renaissance" typified by technology development. In his State of the State address, Abbott also called Houston, Dallas and Austin global "knowledge capitals." But he sparked our curiosity by saying a West Texas city generates more jobs due to startup businesses than California’s arguably edgiest city. "Midland," Abbott said, jabbing with his left index finger, "Midland, Texas, now beats the San Francisco area in the percentage of jobs created by startups." Midland enjoyed a bounce during the latest oil boom. Did it become a hot spot for new jobs and tech jobs? Census Bureau chart We asked Matt Hirsch in Abbott’s office about the basis of this comparison and didn’t hear back. But the day Abbott spoke, journalist R.G. Ratcliffe, writing in Texas Monthly’s Burkablog, attributed the comparison to an analysis of government data by howmuchnet.com, which says it focuses on preparing visualizations about money. That analysis, presented on a U.S. map, indicates that according to U.S. Census data, start-up businesses in 2014 accounted for 4.7 percent of the nonfarm private payroll jobs created that year in Midland. Text above the map states "the epicenter of job creation from startups in the U.S. is in the heart of Midland, Texas." In contrast, according to the presentation, startups in the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont part of California accounted for 2.2 percent of such new jobs. Startups accounted for 2 percent of such new jobs in the San Jose-Sunnyvale region, which encompasses Silicon Valley. The average for U.S. metropolitan areas was 2.1 percent. Besides Midland, other high-growth areas were the Madera-Chowchilla section of northern California and Greenville, N.C. (both with startups accounting for 4.5 percent of nonfarm private payroll jobs created) and the Panama City portion of Florida (4.3 percent)--with Victoria, Texas, also ranking high (4 percent), according to the presentation. The map is accompanied by this explanation: "The Census Bureau defines startups as businesses that began operating in a particular year. There is no prior business activity associated with the startups. The Business Dynamic Statistics produced by the Census Bureau provide valuable information on business in the U.S. across a broad range of statistical categories. Although San Francisco is often associated with tech startups, that definition may include more established businesses that do not qualify as startups according to the fairly strict definition of the Census Bureau." We clicked next to a bureau BDS web page and downloaded its chart, which places Midland No. 1 nationally in 2014 for its share of nonfarm private payroll jobs created by startups. The chart, posted in September 2016, ranks San Francisco 112th among the nation’s 366 metro areas. According to a bureau publication issued with the chart, startups nationally in 2014 created 2.5 million jobs, an improvement from recent years but still below the 2006 pre-Great-Recession count of 3.5 million such jobs then accounting for 3 percent of U.S. private nonfarm employment. Economists queried For perspective on the rankings, we queried a West Texas economist and a counterpart in the San Francisco area. Amarillo economist Karr Ingham oversees the Midland-Odessa Regional Economic Index, which shows Midland’s economy roaring through 2015, but losing steam almost to the end of 2016 before starting to rebound. Ingham added that hard post-2014 data on jobs from startups doesn’t appear to be available, but his sense is that it’s not possible that Midland’s downturn didn’t affect the local pace of jobs created by startups. Conversely, Ingham said, he’d speculate that San Francisco’s economy wasn’t hurt like the Midland economy by oil and gas price drops. That said, Ingham told us, his suspicion is that Midland still has a greater share of jobs created by startups than San Francisco. In California, Juliana Bunim of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce pointed out that the Midland-topped breakdown wasn’t limited to high-tech startups like businesses famously prolific in and near San Francisco. "That’s an important distinction because when people hear the word ‘startup’ they often assume they are technology companies," Bunim said by email. "And of course when it comes down to number of jobs and companies, the Bay Area – though a smaller percentage – has significantly more," Bunim said. She noted too the bureau breakdown covered jobs created by startups in a year, not over several years. By phone, California economist Christopher Thornberg called the focus on the rate of jobs-created-by-startups metric almost laughable given differences in the respective economies. Thornberg suggested Midland’s 2014 spike in jobs tied to startups was all about an oil boom. "The idea you’re going to compare what’s happening with oil in Midland what’s happening with high tech in San Francisco, it’s just apples and oranges," he said. "Both are solid economies. They go about it different ways." A closer look Next, we took a longer look at the Midland-San Francisco comparison. In raw numbers, unsurprisingly, startups in the San Francisco area created far more jobs in 2014 than startups in the Midland area, according to detailed bureau data showing job counts for each of the country’s metro areas starting in the late 1970s. In 2014, according to the data, startups in the San Francisco area were responsible for 43,714 of 1.9 million-plus total jobs. The figure for the Midland area: 3,893 startup-tied jobs out of nearly 87,000 total jobs. We checked too on types of jobs. According to other data pointed out by bureau spokeswoman Jewel Jordan, 29 percent of Midland-area workers in 2014 made oil and gas extraction that area’s No. 1 sector with retail trade accounting for 11 percent of employees and accommodation and food services workers comprising 9 percent of the area’s workers. In the San Francisco area, workers in health care and social assistance accounted for 13 percent of employees, making that the area’s biggest field of work, followed by 12 percent of workers in professional, scientific and technical services and 11 percent in accommodation and food services. We also inquired into whether it was unusual for Midland to outpace San Francisco and other metro areas in a given year. Jordan told us by phone the bureau only made its national rate comparison for the latest year of available data, 2014. But we were able to use the bureau’s annual job counts to calculate rates for all five years through 2014. In each of the years from 2010 through 2014, we found, a greater share of jobs in the Midland area were created by startups than in the San Francisco area. The closest margin: In 2010, 1,291 jobs were launched by startups in the Midland area, accounting for 2 percent of 63,588 total jobs, while 33,223 jobs were created by startups in the San Francisco area, for 1.9 percent of more than 1.77 million total jobs. Notably too, the 4-plus percent of jobs attributed to Midland-area startups in 2014 outpaced the area’s rate in each of the previous four years, which topped out at 2.9 percent in 2013. Our ruling Abbott told legislators Midland "now beats the San Francisco area in the percentage of jobs created by startups." The Midland area in 2014 whaled the San Francisco area by this metric. We don’t know where either region ranks now; the government hasn’t done an update. It’s worth clarifying too that startups in this context simply means new businesses; Midland didn’t become a better-than-California high-tech hub. The two economies differ in scale and job types.

pomt-10460	Says Obama flip-flopped on a gas-tax "holiday."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/24/republican-national-committee-republican/a-flip-but-maybe-not-a-flop/	A new Web video from the Republican National Committee says Sen. Barack Obama has flip-flopped on a gas tax "holiday." The video uses news clips to remind viewers that gas prices have reached record levels and then shows side-by-side comments from Obama and Sen. John McCain. McCain: "I propose that the federal government suspend all taxes on gasoline now paid by the American people — from Memorial Day to Labor Day of this year." Obama: "I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month tax holiday is a bad idea." After another news clip about the price of gas and a repeat of the McCain/Obama comments, the screen fills with these words: "In 2000 as a state senator, Obama voted for a six-month 5 percent gas tax holiday." The ad doesn't actually say "flip-flop," but that point comes through loud and clear. McCain proposed the tax holiday during a speech on April 15, 2008, at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He said a summertime suspension of the gas tax "will be an immediate economic stimulus — taking a few dollars off the price of a tank of gas every time a family, a farmer, or trucker stops to fill up." The federal tax is 18.4 cents per gallon for gasoline and 24.4 cents for diesel fuel. A week after McCain's proposal, Obama said it was not a good economic approach. "I've said I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month tax holiday is a bad idea," Obama said. He said it would have minimal consumer benefit. "We're talking about 5 percent of your total cost of gas that you suspend for three months, which might save you a few hundred bucks that then will spike right up." He said the policy might not help consumers because oil companies might not pass along the savings and he warned that a temporary halt in the tax would deprive the Highway Trust Fund of money for critical infrastructure repairs. So the RNC video has the first part right. Obama is against the McCain proposal. (We should note that Sen. Hillary Clinton has said she is open to the idea as long as the revenue is somehow replaced in the Highway Trust Fund.) Looking back to 2000 when Obama was in the Illinois Senate, gas prices had soared to $1.50 per gallon (high for those days, but a bargain by today's standards) and state legislators wanted to provide some relief. Obama voted for Senate Bill 1310, which reduced the state's sales tax on gasoline from 6.25 percent to 1.25 percent for six months. It passed 50-0, with six senators voting present. Obama joined other senators in requesting gas staions post signs that said the legislature had lowered the gas tax. That was prompted by concerns that oil companies would pocket the savings and not pass it to consumers. Obama even joked that he wanted signs in his district to say "Senator Obama reduced your gasoline prices." But six months later, Obama voted against a bill to make the reduction permanent. He said statistics suggested that "the elimination of the tax has not been passed on to the consumer." The Obama campaign says that's a key reason why he opposes McCain's plan: There is no mechanism to make sure that consumers, rather than oil companies, reap the benefits of the tax holiday. So on this point — how Obama voted in 2000 — the RNC glosses over an important detail. Yes, he voted for the tax holiday the first time, but he opposed an extension of it because he said consumers weren't getting the benefit. So that leaves us with evidence on both sides. The RNC is right that he voted for the 2000 bill and opposes the new McCain proposal. But the RNC leaves out the fact that he opposed the extension because of concern for consumers and now opposes the McCain bill for that reason. But it's not fair to call it a flip-flop when the very reason Obama opposes a suspension of the gas tax now is because he concluded that it didn't work when he supported one in the past. We rule this Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07250	"Without ethanol, gas prices would be at least 15% higher. With gas at four bucks, that means you’re saving 12 bucks on a 20 gallon fill up."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/29/wisconsin-corn-growers-association/wisconsin-corn-growers-association-says-without-et/	The latest run-up in gas prices, to the $4 a gallon range, is causing some Wisconsin drivers to change their travel habits. Gas prices have slid back since touching a recent high of $4.13 a gallon on May 4, 2011, according to Wisconsingasprices.com. When Memorial Day weekend began, they were in the neighborhood of $3.88 a gallon, though prices varied some throughout the state. But that’s still a big jump since the beginning of 2011, when drivers were paying around $3 a gallon for regular unleaded. With the pain at the pump setting in, the corn growers and ethanol industry are trying to make the best of a bad situation. In a radio ad, the Wisconsin Corn Growers Association tells drivers that prices would be even higher without ethanol in the mix. One version of the ad uses a fake host, "Filler Up Phil" who takes calls from people concerned about high gas prices. He tells one caller that ethanol adds to the nation’s fuel supply, and tells another that the fuel additive helps save consumers money. "Without ethanol, gas prices would be at least 15 percent higher," the fake host says. "With gas at four bucks, that means you’re saving 12 bucks on a 20 gallon fill-up." That’ll get your attention, no matter what kind of car you drive. It’s a specific claim but -- as with political ads -- carries a broader message: Ethanol is a boon for your wallet. So, let’s husk it. First, a little background. Most gasoline is blended with 10 percent ethanol, a fuel made from corn. That’s part of federal legislation pushed by the corn growers, the ethanol industry and renewable fuels supporters that seeks to boost the amount of ethanol we burn in our cars. The industry is encouraged -- and propped up -- by a controversial $6 billion package of tax credits, production mandates and tariffs. A key argument in favor of ethanol is that each gallon burned means less oil that needs to be imported. The federal law seeks to boost ethanol production over time. The goal is to reach 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the U.S. market by 2022. Production was about 13 billion gallons in 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration. The effort is driven by a variety of tax breaks and incentives, including a 45 cents a gallon tax credit paid to refineries and a 54 cent a gallon tariff on imported ethanol. The feds also require ethanol to be blended with conventional gas, and since last year when demand fell, they’ve come up with new ways to boost ethanol consumption. But ethanol subsidies are under attack on a variety of fronts, including those who see the system as a wasteful industry handout. The Wall Street Journal editorial board in January launched a major attack on the fuel -- and ethanol backer GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. The newspaper said four of every 10 rows of corn in the U.S. are grown for ethanol, an argument that fed complaints that a food crop was being wasted in our gas tanks. Still others condemn ethanol’s poor fuel efficiency and pollution impacts. And others blame ethanol for driving up the cost of food. So, what about the claim in the ad? The group based its claim on a 2008 report from the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University. The researchers found that ethanol reduces the cost of gasoline by about 40 cents a gallon. They issued an updated report in April 2011 that factored in 2010 data for oil prices and increased production of ethanol. That report delivered an even more startling conclusion: Ethanol cuts gas prices by 89 cents a gallon. It’s even higher if you live in the Midwest -- $1.37 a gallon, the new report says. And the latest report from the center goes one step further. The researchers looked at what would happen if ethanol production stopped immediately. A gallon of gas would cost up to $7.20, or $144 for that 20 gallon fill up. So when you do the math, the savings is even higher than described in the ad. But there is another side to the issue -- one that carries its own costs. The ethanol industry is supported by those aforementioned tax incentives. And federal law requires the industry to brew more, and burn more. Including all of those factors, the Natural Resources Defense Council says it costs taxpayers $4.18 to produce each gallon of ethanol. Oil companies will be forced to buy more of the fuel that taxpayers have paid to brew, the group argues. There’s also the question about burning food for fuel, and the impact that ethanol has on food prices. More corn burned means your cornflakes cost more. Iowa State University economist Bruce Babcock last year estimated that ethanol policies drive up the cost of food by at least 1.5 percent. "I don't see why we can really justify subsidies, when all that does is raises cost of producing food," Babcock told National Public Radio. So where does that leave us (other than relieved we’re not paying $7 a gallon for gas)? The corn growers say we’re paying less at the pump, thanks to ethanol being blended into gasoline. The study they cite provides support for the claim -- indeed, an updated version suggests the radio ad actually low balls the savings per fill-up. But there is a cost to taxpayers to support the ethanol program -- $6 billion a year -- which goes unmentioned in the ad. And using food for fuel drives up the cost of your grocery bill, even as the price at the pump is offset by the program. And there are pollution and fuel efficiency concerns tied to the additive. Those are also unmentioned. So, while generally true, the claim leaves out important information. On our gauge that’s a Half True.

pomt-06295	"If they made no changes whatsoever, the [state employees pension] plan still had enough money to go forward for approximately the next 16 years."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/18/philip-keefe/service-employees-international-union-president-ph/	Leading up to Thursday’s debate over legislation to overhaul Rhode Island’s pension system, unions representing state employees pushed back hard. One of the questions they asked was "What’s the rush?" That theme came up during the Nov. 13 edition of WJAR-TV's "10 News Conference" when Jim Taricani asked Philip Keefe, president of the Service Employees International Union, Local 580, whether he agreed with General Treasurer Gina Raimondo that there is a pension funding crisis. "I don't think there's a crisis," he said. Why? "Because there's still $7.7 billion in the fund. This fund is not going to empty out tomorrow," he said. "By the treasurer's own information that she provided to the advisory panel, . . . if they made no changes whatsoever, the plan still had enough money to go forward for approximately the next 16 years. "So I've been advocating right along -- let's not rush this through. This is a problem that's been in the making for two decades. And now we're going to try to solve it in two weeks?" In fact, the state has been trying to solve the problem for several years. But we were interested in whether the state employee pension plan is destined to run dry in 16 years -- around the year 2027. We asked Keefe for his source and he referred us to Raimondo's June 2011 report, "Truth In Numbers: The Security and Sustainability of Rhode Island's Retirement System." On Page 9, it says a Boston College study said, "Rhode Island's retirement plan for state employees and teachers could run completely out of assets between 2019 and 2023 (much sooner than most public plans in other states)." That's 8 to 12 years, not 16. To explain the variation, we looked at the full Boston College study, "Can State and Local Pensions Muddle Through?" dated March 2011 and written by experts at the Center for Retirement Research. It predicts that the pension fund will run dry, and all the money that current employees had paid into their retirement system would be lost, in: * 12 years (in 2023) if the system remained unchanged and the state's investments earned 8 percent; * 11 years (in 2022) if the state's investments earned 6 percent; * 8 years (in 2019) if the pension fund were frozen for existing employees and retirees, new workers were excluded and the rate of return was 6 percent. The end could come a lot sooner. The actual annual rate of return during the last 10 years has been 2.28 percent after fees and administrative expenses. We sent an e-mail asking Keefe why he said 16 years when the report he was citing said 8 to 12 years. He didn't respond. So what would happen if the fund ran out of money? The state is legally obligated to pay pension benefits. There would be no income from investments to cover those payments. The money contributed by current state employees would be used to pay retirees. The state would have to pay the rest out of the general revenue budget, so taxpayers would be funding retirees on a pay-as-you-go basis. Our ruling Philip Keefe said that if no changes were made to the state pension plan, "the plan still had enough money to go forward for approximately the next 16 years." But the report he cites as evidence states a range of 8 to 12 years, not 16. And even that projection may be optimistic because the report assumes that the state will be making 6 percent to 8 percent on its investments, far higher that the rate of return over the last 10 years. His time frame is so far afield from the report he says he was citing, we rule his statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

Mayor Bill Foster touted the city’s unemployment rate, which he said is lower than the statewide average. Challenger Rick Kriseman countered by saying fewer people are working. "Unfortunately, since Mr. Foster's been mayor, we have less small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg," Kriseman said, "and there are less people employed in the city of St. Petersburg than there were prior to his taking office." We decided to put both candidates’ claims to the Truth-O-Meter. (We checked Foster's claim here and Kriseman's claim about fewer businesses here.) In this check, we’ll examine Kriseman’s line about fewer people working in St. Petersburg than before Foster took office. Kriseman’s statement was a little perplexing. The jobs picture for the nation has improved in recent years, and the same goes for the state. Wouldn’t St. Petersburg logically follow that trend? In short, it does. Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data for the city of St. Petersburg, rough as they may be, do not support Kriseman’s point. The numbers are taken from the government’s monthly survey of 60,000 households. Foster took office in January 2010, several months after the recession officially ended in June 2009. When Foster took office, just over 103,000 St. Petersburg residents were working -- lower than it had been in any point since at least 2003, according to BLS data. But the most recent federal data for July 2013 show the number of people with jobs is up over 115,000. State data offer a more up-to-date figure, showing 116,127 employed residents for August. Granted, that’s still short of the size of the city’s workforce pre-recession. But it’s certainly not a reduction from when Foster took office. Raymond James chief economist Scott Brown cautioned these figures are not consistent or fixed to match trends in population, "but in general, you would expect to see some improvement because we tend to mirror the national and state economy." University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith agreed. "At the city level, especially St. Petersburg, little places like that are just slots in the overall economic cycle," Snaith said. "They’ve just got to ride what’s happening. They’re not going to be able to buck global and national swings that are just incredibly dramatic as they were in this cycle." We rate his statement False.

pomt-03443	Says the 2014-15 Texas budget increases spending by less than the rate of inflation and population growth.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/jun/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-2014-15-texas-budget-increases-/	Texas would go the way of California, a Wall Street Journal editorial warned June 7, 2013, if Gov. Rick Perry didn’t veto the state’s "biggest spending spree in memory" -- a 26 percent surge, it said. Them’s fighting words. Responding to a June 10, 2013, question about the editorial, Perry said, "I’m not sure that those who are making that criticism have a really good handle on the Texas budget process." Perry said, "When you back out the supplemental from the 2013 budget cycle and then you take into account the growth, it is less than population and inflation combined." Let’s unpack that. Lawmakers approved a 2014-15 budget totaling $94.6 billion in general revenue, as in state, spending. But they also adopted so-called supplemental spending measures: House Bill 10, shoring up the budget that runs through August 2013, and House Bill 1025, which likewise allocates money to be spent during the 2013 fiscal year but also contains appropriations for fiscal 2014 and ’15. Perry signed all three measures into law. Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle told us via email that the governor’s comment on the editorial meant the budget would not outpace inflation and population growth if HB 10 and the 2013 portion of HB 1025 were counted as part of the 2012-13 budget. Three close observers of the state budget told us they would do the same as Perry in assigning the 2013 supplemental money to the 2012-13 budget. In contrast, the Journal cited calculations by the conservative, Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation based on comparing all state funds appropriated by the 2011 Legislature to all such funds appropriated by the 2013 Legislature, foundation official Bill Peacock told us by email. Given that Perry focused on the 2014-15 budget, we looked at whether that spending is expected to outpace inflation and population growth. How to measure the increase? For years, Perry has unsuccessfully urged lawmakers to send voters a proposed constitutional amendment that would limit state spending increases to the projected rate of population/inflation growth. But current law caps state spending based on the expected growth of Texans’ personal income. According to a Nov. 14, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news story, population and inflation had increased an average of 9 percent per budget biennium since the mid-1990s, compared to a 12 percent growth rate in personal income. State law directs the Legislative Budget Board to come up with the personal income rate, and at a Nov. 15, 2012, meeting, the board voted to adopt State Comptroller Susan Combs’ predicted rate of 10.71 percent as the spending cap for the 2014-15 biennium. The board isn’t required to estimate population/inflation growth, but board staff spokesman John Barton told us by phone that before that meeting, board staff members had collected three research firms’ October 2012 predictions of Texas’s 2014-15 population/inflation increase. New York-based Moody’s Analytics predicted a rate of 8.9 percent and Colorado-based IHS Global Insight projected a 7.22 percent rate, Barton said. A Waco-based economic research firm, the Perryman Group, used a Texas-specific inflation rate to forecast 9.85 percent growth, Barton said. Staffers didn’t circulate those estimates to the board members, Barton said. However, at the board meeting, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst asked board staff director Ursula Parks for an estimate of likely population/inflation growth in the 2014-15 budget period. Parks gave the Perryman Group’s prediction of 9.85 percent growth. Dewhurst replied: "Bet you lunch it’s less. A little less." He and Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, then pledged to bring in a 2014-15 budget increasing state spending less than 9.85 percent. Barton told us the 9.85 percent rate was reached by compounding Perryman’s estimates of 3.65 percent population growth and 5.98 percent inflation growth for Texas. Another inflation-population projection emerged in January 2013, Barton said, when the comptroller, who advises lawmakers on incoming revenues, predicted a two-year inflation/population increase of 6.56 percent. Also, in May 2013, Moody’s updated its projection to 7.82 percent, Barton said. That was about a percentage point lower than what it provided in late 2012. By email, fiscal analyst Eva DeLuna Castro of the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities told us she arrived at a 6.6 percent projected population/inflation increase by adding predicted Texas population and U.S. Consumer Price Index growth rates published by the comptroller Jan. 7, 2013. However, DeLuna said, that "seems very low by historical standards" and unlikely to happen. "If actual population and inflation growth turns out to be closer to... what it’s been since the 1990s, then these appropriated levels won’t keep up with that," she said. Which spending do you measure? Four categories of money make up Texas’ budgets: general revenue, general revenue that’s dedicated to a specific purpose, federal funds and "other funds." General revenue tends to get the most attention because it’s directly under the Legislature’s control -- it comes from taxes and fees set by the state, not the federal government, and how it is spent is not controlled by dedications in the Texas Constitution. The 2012-13 budget, advanced by lawmakers and signed into law by Perry in 2011, contained $81.3 billion in general revenue spending, according to the budget board’s January 2012 "Fiscal Size-Up" report. In a January 2013 report, the board issued an adjusted, final 2012-13 total of $87.4 billion that anticipated the amounts the 2013 Legislature would later add in the supplemental bills. Those included emergency costs such as wildfire expenses and payments of more than $4.5 billion to cover Medicaid and children’s health care shortfalls not covered in 2011. The 2014-15 budget that lawmakers sent to Perry on June 5, 2013, contained $94.6 billion in general revenue spending, according to the budget committee’s final report, dated May 23, 2013. That indicates state spending in the adopted 2014-15 budget alone -- not counting supplementals -- was up 16.4 percent from what legislators approved in 2011. All spending, counting federal and other monies, rose 3.7 percent, according to a chart emailed to us by Barton, totaling $197 billion for 2014-15. But we still have to account for the supplemental spending measures of 2013. The supplemental measures added $5.4 billion in general revenue to the 2012-13 budget and $387 million general revenue plus $3.9 billion in "rainy day" fund money to the 2014-15 budget -- although $2 billion of the rainy day money won’t be withdrawn if voters turn down a November 2013 proposed constitutional amendment to authorize a water infrastructure bank. Those supplemental amounts (counting the $2 billion water money) increase state spending in the 2012-13 budget to $87.4 billion and elevate state spending in 2014-15 to $95 billion. So with the supplementals factored in, we calculate that state spending is expected to rise 8.7 percent. In all-funds spending that included the supplements, the budget board chart showed a 4.9 percent increase from $190.7 billion to $200.1 billion. Four analyses, two methods And what do other analysts say about the increase in state spending compared to the 9.85 percent projected increase in population/inflation? DeLuna, Williams spokesman Gary Scharrer and Dale Craymer, president of the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, each emailed us analyses. All three used adjusted general-revenue totals very close to what we drew from budget documents, counting supplemental money appropriated for 2013 as part of the 2012-13 budget. Their estimates of the budget’s growth from 2012-13 to 2014-15 ranged from 8 percent to 8.7 percent. In contrast, the Texas foundation cited by the Journal said $106 billion in general revenue and "rainy day" fund money was appropriated "in 2013," according to Peacock’s explanation. Using rounded figures, the foundation reached $106 billion by starting with $95 billion of general revenue spending in the 2014-15 budget, then adding amounts from HB 10 and HB 1025: $7 billion in general revenue and $4 billion in rainy day money. Estimating that the Legislature appropriated $84 billion "during the 2011 session" yielded the increase of 26 percent. The foundation’s explanation says, "Now, this discussion of session spending is different than the traditional method of looking at spending on a biennial basis. … Both are accurate. They simply provide two different views." Upshot: Williams’ office and two outside groups compared all the money scheduled to be spent during fiscal 2012 and ’13 with all the money scheduled to be spent during fiscal 2014 and ’15. The foundation compared all the money in bills passed by the 2011 Legislature with all the money in bills passed by the 2013 Legislature. Our ruling Perry said the 2014-15 Texas budget that legislators approved would keep spending increases below combined changes in population and inflation. Setting aside the foundation’s analysis, which split expenditures by when they were authorized and not which budget they belonged to, we found that state spending rose no more than 8.7 percent from 2012-13 to 2014-15. That falls below the 9.85 percent population/inflation rate embraced by legislators last fall, which is also in line with recent biennial average increases of 9 percent. Then again, the spending could exceed other predictions for that rate. On balance, we rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2013-06-21T16:34:34	2013-06-10	['Texas']

pomt-06941	On opposition to earmarks	no flip	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/20/bill-johnson/was-rep-bill-johnsons-funding-request-airport-impr/	Rep. Bill Johnson is one of the Republican budget hawks elected to Congress for the first time last fall. He denounced earmarks and promised to cut spending. That put him on the radar of political reporter Sam Stein of Huffington Post, who recently made a Freedom of Information Act request for communications between first-term House members and federal agencies. Stein said the correspondence he received "reveals that, in private, GOP lawmakers have pressed for tens of millions of dollars in federal help for their districts, even while decrying federal spending in front of the national press corps." Johnson is the second of 12 lawmakers named in Stein's story. On March 8, he co-signed a letter from colleague Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat from Niles, asking the Department of Transportation for a grant to improve a runway at Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport at a cost of more than $4.3 million. The airport, just north of Youngstown, is in Ryan’s district but also serves Johnson’s, which includes some Youngstown suburbs. Less than a month later, Stein noted, Johnson said on the House floor, "Our nation is broke. The federal government has maxed out its credit card." To Stein, that raised the question "of whether it was inconsistent for a lawmaker who has repeatedly deplored government spending to privately request his own slice of the pie." Stein’s piece caused a stir, getting attention on cable news programs. In light of that story, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Johnson’s position on earmarks on the Flip-O-Meter. Is the request for specific spending consistent with his previously stated position? The congressman’s press secretary, Jessica Towhey, bristled at the question, but stood by the statement she gave Stein: "There’s a difference between smart federal spending and the reckless, irresponsible waste of tax dollars the American people are fed up with," she said. "Congressman Johnson joined with Rep. Tim Ryan in a bipartisan request to the FAA for safety improvements at a part of the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport that the FAA has determined is not safe. This airport is a growing hub for travel and business in Northeast Ohio, and there is strong bipartisan support to ensure the safety of travelers and airport employees." What's the difference between runway spending and runaway spending? What's the difference between "smart federal spending" and a "reckless, irresponsible waste of tax dollars" -- apart from Johnson's support? Those are policy questions for others to debate. But what about Johnson’s position on earmarks? While campaigning against Rep. Charlie Wilson for the 6th District seat last year, he declared himself opposed to all earmarks. He said he opposed "out-of-control spending" and wanted "to stop funding programs that are not working, like the National Endowment for the Arts and other pork and earmarks." So is the request for runway funding consistent with the earmark position? Earmarks are special requests from lawmakers that direct money to be spent in specific ways, usually to the benefit of a lawmaker's home district. They are often attached to a broad funding bill so that the only way to oppose them is to vote the bill down and stall the budgeting process. Critics have long argued that earmarks are likelier to serve special interests rather than the national good. Republicans, including Johnson, approved rules that bar earmarks from legislation when they took control of the House this January. But the airport request, while it does seek funding for a specific project, is not an earmark. It’s not a directed appropriation from Congress that targets a project. It’s not buried in a larger piece of legislation making it difficult to oppose. Rather, it’s a request to the administration asking it to support the project. That’s a big difference. On the Flip-O-Meter, we find Johnson’s position on earmarks rates a No Flip.	None	Bill Johnson	None	None	None	2011-07-20T06:00:00	2011-07-05	['None']
pomt-04801	Rep. Peter Petrarca "voted on two pieces of legislation that helped auto body shops ... and at that point I think there is a conflict of interest."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/21/gregory-j-costantino/challengers-claim-rep-petrarcas-voting-auto-body-b/	One of the issues that sparked outrage around the State House in June was the last-minute lawmaking on behalf of the auto body shop industry. Around 3 a.m. on June 13, lawmakers approved a bill giving auto body shops the right to sue insurance companies if they couldn't agree on the cost of car repairs. The legislation was pushed by John Petrarca, president of Providence Auto Body, and his daughter, Jina Petrarca-Karampetsos, spokeswoman for the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island. They are the father and sister, respectively, of Rep. Peter J. Petrarca, D-Lincoln, who did not vote on the bill. But insurance company representatives said Representative Petrarca, the House senior deputy majority leader, had lobbied hard for the legislation. Governor Chafee vetoed the bill days later, saying it would hurt consumers by generating lawsuits that ultimately would increase insurance premiums and interfere with customers' contracts with their insurance companies. But Petrarca's challenger in the House District 44 Democratic primary, Gregory J. Costantino, sought to keep Petrarca in the cross hairs of criticism when the two men appeared on "Newsmakers" on Channel 12 (WPRI) on Aug. 12. Costantino said that while Petrarca might not have voted on this most recent legislation, he had voted on auto shop bills in the past, which Costantino described as a clear conflict of interest. As an example, Costantino referred vaguely to a bill in 2003 and another one in 2010. He gave no specifics about either piece of legislation. In response, Petrarca said: "I don't know what they do. I don't know what they are." And then he launched into an unrelated line of incriminations against Costantino. We were curious what legislation Costantino was referring to and whether he was correct in saying that Petrarca - whose law firm represents Providence Auto Body and the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island - had indeed voted for them. In a telephone interview, Costantino identified the two bills in question, amended pieces of legislation that had passed between the House and Senate: 2003 Senate bill 0022 and 2010 Senate bill 2508. The 2003 bill specifies standards for when "aftermarket" parts - those that come from a company other than the car manufacturer - can be used in repairs. For instance, it states that if an insurance company orders an auto body shop to use an aftermarket part, the insurance company is responsible for any cost a shop incurs trying to fit that part into place. It also requires the shop to notify the appraiser if the aftermarket part does not restore the car to its original condition. The 2010 bill would make it an unfair claims practice if an insurance company failed to use an independent appraiser -unaffiliated with the repair shop - when vehicle damage exceeded $2,500. We called the State House Library to check the House Journal for the votes of those two bills. The records do indeed show Petrarca voting on both occasions - each time in favor of the bills, which passed. When we called Petrarca, he said he still didn't know what bills his opponent had been talking about, and so we brought him up to speed with what we learned. He was unapologetic. "Those two bills, those pieces of legislation, do not benefit body shops," he said. "They benefit the consumer." With the 2003 bill, he said, "If the shop can prove that the aftermarket part doesn't fit, they [insurance company] have to pay for a new part. "There is no conflict [of interest] because it doesn't affect body shops. He [Costantino] should get his facts right." Our ruling Gregory Costantino said during a recent "Newsmakers" broadcast that Rep. Peter Petrarca had in the past voted for two pieces of auto body shop legislation and therefore his actions amounted to a conflict of interest. The official legislative record shows Petrarca voted on the bills. And considering Petrarca's professional and personal connections to the auto body shop industry, his vote on them posed at least an appearance of conflict of interest. But whether the bills actually help body shops or consumers is debatable. Therefore we rate Costantino's claim: Mostly True.	None	Gregory J.

pomt-00804	By allowing brewpubs to sell beer, Georgia could become like Mexico with only a couple of manufacturers controlling all aspects of market.	false	/georgia/statements/2015/apr/02/martin-smith/fact-checkers-find-beer-will-not-transform-georgia/	Georgia craft beer brewers and brew pub owners are waging a down-to-the-wire fight to change state law so they can sell directly to consumers. They’re hoping that today, during the harried 40th and final legislative day, state lawmakers will pass a bill allowing breweries and brew pubs to send beer home with patrons. For nearly a decade, Georgia beer brewers have been lobbying lawmakers to change state law so they can sell their product directly to consumers, something the state’s beer wholesalers and retailers oppose and laws dating to the end of Prohibition ban. At least 45 states already allow such sales, mostly in response to the growing popularity of breweries and brew pubs. Versions of the beer bill (Senate Bill 63) have cleared the Senate and House. But the much-talked-about bill won’t make it to the desk of the governor this year unless the Senate signs off today on House changes — including a March 23 subcommittee move that killed efforts to allow to-go sales at brew pubs. That followed testimony from Martin Smith, a lobbyist for the Georgia Beer Wholesalers, that opening the door to such sales could result in giant conglomerates dominating the market. "When you allow producers to have access and allow retail, you allow that slide into what happens in the rest of the world where large producers own everything," Smith testified. "In Mexico, 90 percent of the market is controlled by one entity. It allows the manufacturer to own the retail." PolitiFact Georgia wondered, was Smith right to suggest that allowing brew pubs to sell beer for off-site consumption would set the stage for a tightly controlled beer market on par with Mexico’s? We decided to take a deeper look. First, a little background about this country's craft brewing as well as the Mexico beer market. Small and independent craft brewers in the United States reported producing 22.2 million barrels of beer in 2014, worth about $19.6 billion, or about 19 percent of an otherwise flat national beer sales network. The criticism of the Mexican beer market for years was that it effectively had largely two players and a duopoly, Modelo (owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev) and FEMSA (owned by Heineken). Smith told PolitiFact that his comments about the Mexican beer market came in response to a lawmaker’s question. (He also clarified that he wrongly told the committee there was one major producer in Mexico, rather than two.) Smith said he was describing the advantages of America’s three-tier system of beer industry brewers, distributors and retailers, which some consider the most powerful antitrust measure ever established. "It provides equal market access for all brewers as the system restricts producers from controlling shelves or taps at retail, thus preventing market domination by a few producers," Smith said in an email. "I referenced Mexico as an example of a country where producers are allowed to directly control the retail market, and thus two producers control 90 percent of the beer market, which essentially blocks out all new, small, ‘craft’ producers." Last month, Craig Purser, president of the National Beer Wholesalers Association. said policymakers "need only look to America’s neighbor to the south, Mexico, to see what can happen without a three-tier system. " As Joni Mitchell sang, "You don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone," Purser wrote in a column. Bart Watson, the chief economist for the Colorado-based Brewers Association, the craft brewers trade association, called the Mexico argument "a red herring." This "slippery slope" argument is one the National Beer Wholesalers Association constantly uses to try to forestall even minor changes to the three-tier system, Watson said. But Georgia’s proposed changes "are small, reasonable and would likely be beneficial for the state and consumers," he said. Watson said there’s no evidence that any state — including Georgia — has or would develop into a Mexico with only a couple of producers dominating the market. All states that allow brew pub to-go sales have limits on production, sales or most often both, Watson said. At least 42 states allow "to-go" brew pub sales, said Nancy Palmer, the executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild. Four — Georgia, Alabama, Florida and New Mexico — don’t allow customers to leave with beer in a resealable container, Watson said. Even in the states with what are considered the laxest laws, the result has been more, not less, consumer choice, he said. "The NBWA’s opposition to these laws by comparing them to what has happened in Mexico is nonsensical," Watson said. Palmer, from the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild, said the Mexico argument "is just one in a series of straw-man arguments that the wholesalers and their crew of lobbyists use to confuse, obfuscate and distract from the actual issues at hand." Georgia’s proposed law has strict sales limits. As introduced, it would allow breweries to sell up to 72 ounces per person per day on-site and up to a 12-pack to go. It would lift a prohibition on bottling by brew pubs, which are now restricted to making draft beer only, and allow them to have to-go sales of up to 144 ounces of beer per day per person. The Senate version bars brewery sales but would allow them to sell tours and give away "free tastings" of up to 36 ounces per person per day, plus a "free souvenir" of 64 ounces in a to-go container. Our ruling A vast majority of states have allowed breweries and brew pubs to sell directly to their consumers in a segment of the beer market that is flourishing. There’s no evidence that they could become consumer-unfriendly market-rulers under existing state laws or Georgia's proposed law. To say otherwise is beyond a stretch. We rate the statement False.

Edwards goes on to say Flores “has been recruited by Washington, D.C., insiders to try to buy our district's congressional seat with millions of dollars he has made as a Houston oil executive even though he has never once voted in a general election in our district — not even once.” The charge that a wealthy candidate is trying to "buy" elective office is common in politics; for this article, we're looking at whether Edwards accurately depicts Flores’ voting history as a resident of the conservative-leaning 17th Congressional District. It covers more than 7,700 square miles in 12 counties, stretching from the suburbs of Fort Worth, south through Waco and east to Bryan/College Station. To back Edwards’ claim that Flores has never voted in a general election in the district, Edwards’ campaign pointed us to a Washington blog post and an article in the Dallas Morning News. Those reports and others published by the Waco Tribune-Herald and online Texas Tribune don't spell out all of Flores’ voting history. But they touch on Flores voting in the 2008 Democratic primary. At that time, Rob Curnock was running unopposed in the GOP primary to challenge Edwards. In this year's primary runoff in April, Flores defeated Curnock to win his party's nod for the House seat. The Tribune's March 29 article quotes Matt Mackowiak, Flores’ campaign manager, saying Flores voted in that Democratic primary in order to oppose then-Sen. Barack Obama for president, fearing Obama “would take our country far to the left.” Mackowiak is also quoted saying he doesn’t know which Democratic presidential candidate Flores voted for. Later that year, Mackowiak said, Flores phone-banked for GOP nominee John McCain on the day of the November election, got stuck in business meetings and was unable to leave in time to vote in the general election. To independently gauge Flores’ voting history, we contacted Brazos County. Flores, who lives in Bryan, has said his wife moved to the county in 2006, according to a voter guide posted online by the Dallas Morning News. Mackowiak said Flores lived in College Station while the couple's house was being built in nearby Bryan. Kathy Schuetze, the county’s voter registration coordinator, told us records show Flores voting five times there: the 2010 GOP primary and runoffs, fall 2009 elections related to the Bryan Independent School District and proposed state constitutional amendments, plus the 2008 Democratic primary Trying another source, we contacted Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin, who maintains a statewide voter database. Smith said his database indicates that Flores registered to vote in Brazos County in December 2006. He said that while Flores missed the 2008 general election, Flores' wife, Gina Bass Flores, did vote then. So, there's no indication Flores has voted in a general election in the district. Then again, we wondered if the 2009 balloting on proposed constitutional amendments also was a general election because it occurred on a date that state law defines as the possible date of a special or general election -- the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November. Randall Dillard, spokesman for the Texas Secretary of State, which oversees elections, said many voters might have thought they were voting in a general election. However, Dillard noted, the Texas Election Code defines a general election as an election, other than a primary, that regularly recurs at fixed dates. In contrast, state legislators pick the dates of elections on proposed constitutional amendments. Flores' voting record drew questions earlier this year. Flores said at a February debate that he voted for Curnock in the 2008 general election -- then later said he'd been joking, according to an online post by the Lone Star Project, a pro-Democratic group. We sought to interview Flores. Mackowiak declined our request. He also confirmed that Flores has yet to vote in a general election in the district. We rate Edwards’ statement as True.

pomt-11695	"The average life expectancy for African Americans in Saint Louis and Saint Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population, with nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 living in poverty."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/24/cora-faith-walker/Cora-Faith-Walker-mostly-right-on-life-expectancy/	In a Nov. 9 guest commentary for the St. Louis American, Rep. Cora Faith Walker, D-Ferguson, wrote that funding cuts to Medicaid programs would further hurt African-American communities. "The average life expectancy for African-Americans in Saint Louis and Saint Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population, with nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 living in poverty," Walker wrote. Those are striking statistics, so we reached out to Walker to find out where she got them. She sent us a copy of a 2015 "For the Sake of All" report, which analyzes "the health and well-being of African Americans in St. Louis." Walker also outlined the primary sources cited in the report. We reached out to the report’s project directors to find out where these stats came from. Life expectancy Walker wrote that the average life expectancy for African-Americans in St. Louis City and St. Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population. Where does that information come from? For the Sake of All project director Jason Purnell told us the figure comes from a comparison between residents in the ZIP code 63106 in the city and the ZIP zip code 63105 in the county. For the Sake of All’s report breaks down the differences in life expectancy for different ZIP codes within St. Louis city and county. On page 27 of the report, a map showing life expectancy at birth by ZIP code is accompanied by this description: "A child born in 63106 near the Jeff-Vander-Lou neighborhood can expect to live 18 fewer years than a child born in 63105 (Clayton), 15 fewer years than a child born in 63017 (Chesterfield), 14 fewer years than children born in 63122 (Kirkwood) and 63109 (St. Louis Hills), and 3 years fewer than a child born in 63133 (Pagedale/Wellston)," the report says. Research Project Coordinator Rachel Barth said the life expectancies were constructed using a calculator developed by the City of St. Louis Department of Health – Center for Health Information, Planning, and Research, and life expectancies by ZIP code were derived using population counts from the 2010 Census and deaths from the Missouri Information for Community Assessment’s 2010 data. To be clear, the data aren’t comparing life expectancies by race. Walker is extrapolating that based on what she knows about the ZIP codes analyzed. The report notes that the areas with lowest life expectancies — such as ZIP code 63106 that has an average life expectancy of 67 years — "are also in areas with the highest concentration of African-American population." "We do not have calculations for life expectancy by race," Barth told PolitiFact Missouri. However, ZIP code 63105, which includes Clayton, is predominately white — which is where Walker may have based her assertion "compared to the white population." "What I think Rep. Walker is getting at is the life expectancy for residents living in 63106 (95 percent of whom are African-American) is 67 years, whereas the life expectancy for residents living in 63105 (92 percent of whom are white) is 85 years of age," Barth said. To summarize, Walker is comparing ZIP codes in the St. Louis area and identifying where the greatest life expectancy disparity exists. Those ZIP codes align with overwhelmingly African-American or white populations. However, there may be other variables that weren’t considered in the study that have an effect on the average life expectancy. Poverty Walker went on to say that "nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 (are) living in poverty." That’s from the same report, but the statistic is outdated and relies on 2012 Census information. In 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, 46 percent of African-American children under 18 lived in poverty in St. Louis County and St. Louis City, Barth said. According to the more recent Census Bureau estimate from 2016, the figure has fallen to 33 percent, Barth said. The decrease coincides with the improvement of the economy in Missouri. Our ruling Walker said "the average life expectancy for African Americans in Saint Louis and Saint Louis County varies by as much as 18 years compared to the white population, with nearly half of all African-American kids under the age of 18 living in poverty." Walker based this assertion on a study showing a wide difference in life expectancy between two ZIP codes within the city and county of St. Louis. That’s not exactly a comparison of life expectancy by race, but given that one ZIP code is heavily African-American and the other is heavily white, it’s a reasonable proxy. As for the poverty claim, the rate remains high, but the 50 percent figure is based on old data. More recent estimates find that about a third of African-American children in the St. Louis area are living in poverty. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-12976	"Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/21/usa-snich/website-hypes-long-shot-theory-about-courts-replac/	A widely shared post from a little-known website suggests that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election could lead the courts to install Hillary Clinton as president. "Breaking: Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President," says a Dec. 11, 2016, post on USA Snich, a website so obscure that Googling "USA Snich" only brings up references to the Harry Potter game of quidditch (though it uses a "snitch") or articles about prison snitching. Yet the post got enough interest by social media users that it popped up in the list of questionable articles Facebook is sharing with PolitiFact and other fact-checkers. (The USA Snich post is actually a nearly verbatim reprint of one from the site SupremePatriot.com.) One reason for the wide sharing may be that the post hit a social media sweet spot: What it advertises would simultaneously outrage conservatives and give liberals hope. As it happens, the USA Snich post frames it in a way favorable to conservatives, calling the notion advanced in the headline "scary" and concluding, "What a bunch of BS. This will never happen! #NEVERHILLARY." However, posts with a similar message as this headline also appeared on liberal sites, such as Occupy Democrats. So what’s going on with the USA Snich post? Let’s take a closer look. A legal precedent? The post links to an article published on the Huffington Post. It was written by a contributor -- not a Huffington Post staff member -- named Alex Mohajer, who is identified as "political director of Bros4Hillary, a volunteer advocacy organization" and the holder of a law degree. In the column, Mohajer writes that recent allegations of Russian-linked hacking could provide a basis for the federal courts to get involved with the election’s outcome, through a case that’s little known even among constitutional scholars. "At least one federal court decision suggests there may be some federal case law on the question of whether it is possible to invalidate the outcome of an election after the fact when there is fraud, and replace a candidate benefitted by fraud with his opponent," he wrote. "The case, Marks v. Stinson, is the first and only known case in which a federal judge reversed an election outcome." The 1995 case revolved around allegations that Democrat William G. Stinson colluded with election officials to cast illegally obtained absentee ballots. In February 1994, after Stinson had taken office, the federal judge ordered him removed and replaced by his opponent, Republican Bruce Marks. An appellate court affirmed the district court’s intervention in the matter, but it objected to the court seating Marks, although because Marks was already serving, the court allowed him to continue for the remainder of the term. Here’s the money paragraph: The case offers an "interesting rationale that could theoretically be applied in part if, after Donald Trump assumes office, it is shown that Russian hacking (or any fraud, for that matter) robbed Hillary Clinton of the presidency," Mohajer writes. "The case offers clues that imply courts may intervene." This is a novel legal theory. We asked Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional scholar at the University of Pennsylvania, what he thought of it. "I'm pretty confident that there's zero chance of it happening," Roosevelt said. "I could see a court reversing the result of an election if fraud was proved along the lines of, ‘Candidate A really won 150 to 100, but Candidate B fraudulently altered the records to make it look like he won 150 to 100.’ But that's not what happened. No one credible is alleging that the election was affected by that kind of fraud. The votes recorded were the votes that were cast. They may have been influenced by fake news and Russian propaganda, but there's no judicial remedy for that." The USA Snich post In other words, the theory offered in the headline is, at most, the longest of longshots. So right off the bat, the headline elevates the urgency of a legal theory of uncertain value that had been advanced by one Clinton supporter. The USA Snich post (and the SupremePatriot post) also leave out a lot of cautionary words that Mohajer himself had inserted in his original column. While USA Snich did link to the Huffington Post column and reposted several paragraphs of what Mohajer wrote, none of the paragraphs reprinted actually addresses the legal theory underpinning the headline’s claim that the courts could overturn the election. To find that, a reader would have to click the Huffington Post link, something many readers presumably won’t make the effort to do. Mohajer’s column acknowledges some significant questions about the theory. "Obviously both the stakes and the office in question are much higher than in Marks v. Stinson," he wrote. "There has been no case of first impression with regards to the presidency being overturned to a wrongful winner’s opponent. There is also, of course, no constitutional Electoral College process or system in Pennsylvania, so the situations are not exactly analogous. … It is not clear how the case would impact a presidential election." When we reached out to Mohajer, he said that being a law school graduate, he thought of the piece as "an academic exercise." "I thought it was an interesting case on election fraud and the only federal court ruling I could find that had a judge replacing an elected official with their opponent from the election because of fraud," Mohajer told PolitiFact. "It would require courts use a liberal interpretation of the word ‘fraud’ and would probably require some wrongdoing by Trump." In the interview, Mohajer acknowledged that the likelihood of this scenario occurring is "next to lightning striking the same person twice." "Ultimately, is it plausible? Of course not," he said. "But If you had asked me 12 months ago whether I thought Donald Trump would elected president, I would have answered in kind with the exact same certainty." Our ruling USA Snich posted an item headlined, "Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President." This urgent headline is based on a novel legal theory that a constitutional scholar casts doubt upon, and that its own creator acknowledges is extremely unlikely to win the support of the jusicial system. Meanwhile, the text of the USA Snich article doesn’t even address the substance of the legal argument outlined in the headline, and in so doing, it leaves out any sense that the author offered his own series of caveats about the legal theory’s applicability. We rate the USA Snich headline False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9632f68e-3085-4aa4-a587-bd626c917e73	None	USA Snich	None	None	None	2016-12-21T13:09:00	2016-12-11	['None']
pomt-05524	President Obama's refusal to grant permits for offshore drilling is one reason gasoline prices are soaring.	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/12/mike-huckabee/says-president-obamas-refusal-issue-offshore-drill/	A robocall we received last week, recorded by Fox News host and former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, claims that President Obama’s refusal to grant permits for offshore drilling is a key reason why gasoline prices have been rising. Huckabee says the call is on behalf of the conservative group Presidential Coalition. In it, he claims "the potential for $5- or $6-a-gallon gasoline this year terrifies Barack Obama, and it's an issue that we can lay directly on his doorstep. Obama's veto of the Keystone pipeline, his refusal to drill in Alaska or grant permits for offshore drilling, his cozying up to the Middle East and weakness on the energy issue, that's the reason gas prices are soaring, and don't let anyone tell you different." First, Obama never vetoed the pipeline, which originally had a route that was opposed by Nebraska's governor, a Republican; it has never come to his desk for a signature. Obama expressed opposition to a Republican bill designed to push it through without going through the normal approval process. But we were more interested in checking one of the other key parts of Huckabee’s claim -- that the president had refused to grant permits for offshore drilling. That claim has been around for a while. In March 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann, also a Republican, reported that only one new oil drilling permit had been issued since Obama took office. That statement earned her a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact National in part because Bachmann made her statement 15 days after Obama reported at a news conference that more than 35 new offshore drilling permits had been approved. (A moratorium on permits had been imposed to implement new safety and environmental standards in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.) To get the latest count for the Gulf of Mexico, we turned to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, BSEE.gov. Since new shallow water well regulations were put into effect June 8, 2010, the bureau reports, 122 permits for drilling where the water depth is 500 feet or less have been approved. New regulations for deep-water wells took effect Oct. 12, 2010. Since then, 167 have been permitted by the Obama administration. BSEE spokeswoman Eileen Angelico said 27 of those permits were for existing wells where drilling was suspended during the moratorium. That leaves 140 new deep-water wells just in the Gulf of Mexico. In fact, federal authorities have also approved two other drilling permits -- for wells off the Alaska coast. Our ruling Mike Huckabee is telling people who receive his robocall that Obama has refused to issue offshore drilling permits -- one reason, he says, why gasoline prices are soaring. In fact, 140 permits for new deep-water wells have been issued since the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. More than hundred shallow water permits have also been issued since the moratorium was lifted, but we didn't ask how many of those were new because it is clear, just from the deep-water data, that Huckabee's claim is bogus. "Don't let anyone tell you different," Huckabee says in his robocall as he faults the president for not approving new wells. Well, we're telling you different. His statement is so ridiculously at odds with the facts, we've tapped our own reservoir of flammable hydrocarbons to give him -- and by association, the Presidential Coalition -- a Pants on Fire!

pomt-04404	Says Mitt Romney "called the Arizona law a model for the nation."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-says-mitt-romney-called-arizona-/	In the second presidential debate at Hofstra University, President Barack Obama repeated a claim that he and many of his allies have repeated for months. Referring to a high-profile Arizona immigration law known as S.B. 1070, Obama said Romney "called the Arizona law a model for the nation." Soon after Obama made that claim, Romney fired back. "I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect," Romney said at the debate. "I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation." They both can’t be right. So which one is correct? PolitiFact Texas looked at this question earlier this year. We’ll recap and update their analysis here. First, some background on the law. In June, the Supreme Court delivered a mixed ruling on the Arizona law. It threw out parts that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations, including provisions requiring immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers, making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants, according to the Associated Press. But the court let stand a "show me your papers" requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. And they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges. The notion that Romney called S.B. 1070 a "model for the nation" stems from a comment he made during a Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Arizona. As John King of CNN framed his question to Romney, the audience applauded mention of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona’s Maricopa County, who is known for his advocacy of hard-line immigration policies. King said to Romney: "You've talked, governor, about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. But what about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as Sheriff Arpaio advocates?" Romney answered, "You know, I think you see a model here in Arizona. They passed a law here that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. And as a result of E-Verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent." E-Verify is a federal, Internet-based system that employers can use to verify whether someone is authorized to work in the United States. Participation is voluntary for most U.S. businesses -- there is no federal mandate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website says that more than 280,000 employers across the country are using the system. After the Arizona debate, many reporters, opinion columnists, Democrats and liberal groups interpreted that statement by Romney as him saying that SB 1070 as a whole should be a model, either for the nation or for other states. However, Dan Nowicki, the Arizona Republic’s national political reporter, questioned those interpretations in a March 3, 2012, news article that noted that Arizona’s requirement that businesses use E-Verify is not contained in SB 1070 but rather in an earlier state law, the Legal Arizona Workers Act. "It's clear from the (debate) transcript that Romney was describing part of the state's 2007 employer-sanctions law, which has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court," Nowicki wrote. "That Arizona law requires employers to use a federal electronic system to verify whether new hires are eligible to work in the United States and provides punishment for companies that hire undocumented immigrants." In other words, Romney in the debate saluted the E-Verify element of a 5-year-old Arizona law — which was not part of the 2010 immigration-enforcement law. It’s important to note that Romney is not opposed to the Arizona law. In fact, at the same debate, he said that if elected, he would drop federal lawsuits against the Arizona law "on day one." Romney expressed support for the law at least as early as Sept. 13, 2011, during an event in Arizona sponsored by the Christian Broadcasting Network. According to the CBN account, Romney said, "Well, I support the Arizona law by recognizing what Arizona has done -- underscored the failure of the federal government to do its job." Then, shortly after the Supreme Court decision, Romney echoed this view, saying he believes that "each state has the duty — and the right — to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities." And Romney spokesman Ryan Williams confirmed to PolitiFact after the debate that the candidate’s view remains the same. "He said very clearly he supports the right of states to craft individual laws to help them address failures of the federal government, but he has never said that S.B. 1070 is a ‘model for the nation," Williams said. Our ruling Obama said Mitt Romney "called the Arizona law a model for the nation." That statement mischaracterizes Romney’s salute to Arizona’s mandate that employers electronically verify the legal status of employees, which was passed in 2007 and was not included in S.B. 1070. We rate the statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-17T00:48:04	2012-10-16	['Arizona']
pomt-08974	"Rick Perry accepted more stimulus funds than any other governor except the governors of California and New York."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/18/bill-white/white-says-perry-accepted-more-stimulus-funds-ever/	Trying to portray his GOP opponent as more cozy with Washington than he lets on, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Bill White highlighted the state's use of federal money during a speech to his party's state convention in Corpus Christi. Texas Gov. "Rick Perry accepted more stimulus funds than any other governor except the governors of California and New York," White said June 25. Gee, the nation's three most-populous states took in the most stimulus aid? The only reason that's surprising is Perry made a point of not taking a chunk of available aid in 2009 -- a move in keeping with his anti-Washington posture. We decided White's statement needed a closer look. Some background: The $787 billion federal stimulus package, otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, became law in February 2009, with the goals of giving the struggling U.S. economy a lift, as well as creating and saving jobs. State governments have been the primary recipients, although federal money has also gone directly to entities such as schools, hospitals and contractors. The Recovery Act specified that governors had 45 days after the passage of the law to certify that their state would "request and use funds provided by" the law. On Feb. 18, 2009, Perry sent President Barack Obama the requisite letter of certification, assuring the president that the state would accept the funds and use them "in the best interest of Texas taxpayers." In his letter, Perry also wrote that he opposed using "these funds to expand existing government programs" because the state would be burdened "with ongoing expenditures long after the funding has dried up." The day before, Perry told a National Federation of Independent Business meeting in Austin that "we need the freedom to pick and choose our obligations, so we can say 'no thanks' to items that stick us with the bill in the out years, when Washington goes flying after the next miracle cure," according to the governor's prepared remarks. In response to our inquiry about White's statement, Katy Bacon, his spokeswoman, pointed us to a section of Recovery.gov, the federal website that tracks stimulus spending, that gives a state-by-state breakdown of the value of contracts, grants, loans and entitlement funds being distributed by federal agencies. The figures, based on the agencies' reports, are updated weekly. As of June 30, 2010, the breakdown ranked Texas third behind California and New York in both "funds available," meaning money to be released either immediately or in the future, and "funds paid out." Right away, we found a wrinkle. Cheryl Arvidson, assistant director of communications for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, which maintains the website, said the totals include all stimulus funds flowing into each state, not just dollars that pass through state government. Thus neither Perry nor the state was involved in taking some of that money. We didn't find any statistics that gauged only the stimulus dollars flowing through state governments. The closest thing: A report released in April 2009 by the Federal Funds Information for States, a subscription service of the National Governors Association and the National Conference of State Legislatures that tracks the financial impact of federal actions on states. It estimated how much Recovery Act money each state would receive under about 40 major grant programs. Texas ($16.3 billion) ranked third, behind California ($27.1 billion) and New York ($21.7 billion). Another count for Texas comes from the state comptroller's office, which tracks stimulus dollars coming into state agencies and public colleges and universities. As of July 11, 2010, $19.7 billion had been awarded, with $11.7 billion received. The Legislature appropriated $14.4 billion of the total for fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011, according to the comptroller's website. The story so far: Despite criticizing some aspects of the stimulus program, Perry has accepted billions of stimulus dollars on the state's behalf. In fact, Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, didn't quibble about Perry being among the three governors who have taken the most stimulus money. That's to be expected, she indicated, because the federal government doles out the funds based on "many formulas" -- population being "one of the most predominant factors." Said Cesinger: "It's no surprise that Texas ... would be allocated significantly more stimulus dollars than most other states." California is the most-populous state, with about 35 million people; Texas is second with 24 million; and New York is third, with about 20 million. Likewise, Mike Leachman, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said the size of the Texas economy and the needs of its large population played a role in the amount of money that the state received. For example, almost all of the $5.2 billion in stimulus funds awarded to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission is going to Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Stephanie Goodman, a commission spokeswoman, said federal Medicaid funding is normally based on a formula that includes state economic factors such as per-capita income; the stimulus program added a component that increases federal aid in conjunction with rising unemployment. But Texas hasn't taken all the funding that was offered. Last year, Perry opposed about $550 million for the state's unemployment trust fund, aid that was contingent on Texas making it easier for workers to qualify for unemployment benefits. The governor said businesses would have had to pay higher unemployment taxes after the federal dollars ran out. An effort by some legislators to overrule Perry died in the state House. Perry also caused a stir this year when he opted not to apply for additional education stimulus funding in the competitive federal grant program known as Race to the Top. Summing up? In his convention speech, White said Perry has accepted more stimulus funding than the governors of any other states, except for California and New York.

pomt-08143	The DREAM Act the "would give amnesty to over two million illegal aliens."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/06/rightmarchcom/rightmarchcom-claims-dream-act-would-provide-amnes/	The DREAM Act -- which would provide a path to permanent citizenship for children brought to the United States by illegal immigrants -- is on the agenda for possible action in the final days of the 111th Congress. With Democratic leaders hoping to bring the issue to a vote in the lame-duck session, opponents of the DREAM ACT have amped up their efforts to derail it. In a message posted to Conservative Action Alerts, and copied and circulated via chain e-mail, a group called RightMarch.com warns that the Dream Act "would give amnesty to over two million illegal aliens." As the name implies, RightMarch.com is a conservative group that boasts being "on the front lines of fighting against amnesty for illegal immigrants." The message was signed by RightMarch.org president William Greene. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act would allow children brought to the United States by illegal immigrants to obtain permanent legal status if they complete two years of college or enlist in the military. There are currently several versions of the DREAM Act kicking around in Congress, but under the version introduced in March 2009, people under 35 who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 and have lived here at least the last five years would be able to apply for legal permanent resident status on a conditional basis if they have obtained a U.S. high school diploma or GED. That conditional status would be upgraded to permanent after six years if they successfully complete at least two years of college or military service and if they maintain "good moral character." It is a matter of debate whether that can accurately be called "amnesty." The difference between "amnesty," "legalization," and "earned legalization" is more about framing and semantics than anything else, said Marc Rosenblum, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. "That said, 'amnesty' emphasizes the fact that an unauthorized immigrant is being forgiven for having been here illegally," Rosenblum said. "There is an element of that in the DREAM Act given that supporters emphasize that DREAM beneficiaries were brought here by their parents and should not be held strictly accountable/responsible for becoming unauthorized immigrants." The 1986 immigration bill -- which allowed many illegal immigrants who entered the United States before 1982 to earn temporary, and eventually permanent, residency and citizenship -- explicitly included an "amnesty." Supporters of the DREAM Act, however, do not describe it as "amnesty," partly because "amnesty" has become a politically toxic term in the debate, Rosenblum said. The bigger issue here is the claim that the DREAM Act would provide citizenship to more than two million people. In July, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) completed an analysis of the potential Dream Act beneficiaries and concluded there are about 2.1 million people who would be potentially eligible for citizenship. Using Census data, here's how MPI broke it down: * 114,000 qualified people with at least an associate's degree. Those people would be eligible for conditional status, and permanent status within six years. * 612,000 with a high school diploma or GED eligible for conditional status; but who would need to complete two years of college or enlist in the military to obtain permanent status. * 489,000 between the ages of 18 and 34 with no high school degree, and who would not therefore, be eligible for conditional status unless or until they got a GED. * And 934,000 under the age of 18 who would be eligible for conditional status in the future if they obtain a high school degree. So that's the universe of the 2.1 million people who would potentially be eligible for citizenship under that version of the DREAM Act. But according to the MPI report, "historical trends indicate that far fewer are likely to actually gain permanent (or even conditional) status, due primarily to the bill’s education attainment requirements." In fact, when considering factors such as English language ability, income levels, the presence of children and employment status, MPI estimated that only about 38 percent of that 2.1 million would likely obtain permanent legal status. That comes to 850,000 people. Several newer versions of the DREAM Act have been proposed in recent months, all of which would be more restrictive (such as lowering the eligible age from 35 to 30). Therefore, MPI's Rosenblum said, the newer versions would decrease the number of those likely to gain citizenship (to about 750,000, depending on the version). One factor not considered is how much that number might increase due to the incentive it creates for undocumented youth to go to college in order to obtain citizenship. "It's difficult to predict how big a carrot that is," Rosenblum said. But even the folks at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group critical of illegal immigration, acknowledge that it's unlikely that 2.1 million people would achieve citizenship. Because of the educational requirements, "it doesn't seem likely that anywhere close to that number would ultimately qualify," said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies. "Nobody thinks all of the people would get it." We called RightMarch.com to confirm the "more than 2 million" figure was obtained from the MPI analysis. We did not hear back from them, but we couldn't find any other reputable group that has analyzed the DREAM Act to estimate the number of people it might affect. And data from MPI is regularly cited by all sides in the immigration debate. The claim by RightMarch.com is that the DREAM Act would give amnesty to 2.1 million illegal immigrants. That's very definitive. In fact, though, that's the number of people who would be potentially eligible to earn citizenship. The RightMarch.org figure assumes every single child of an illegal immigrant who meets the age requirements will complete two years of college or join the military. That's not realistic. In fact, the Migration Institute estimates the number of people likely to obtain permanent citizenship is actually less than half that. It's in the same report. We rate the RightMarch.org claim False.	None	RightMarch.com	None	None	None	2010-12-06T16:02:34	2010-12-01	['None']
pomt-09536	"One state even spent a million bucks to put up signs that advertise that they were spending on the federal stimulus projects."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/08/sarah-palin/palin-claims-state-paid-1-million-advertise-they-w/	In her keynote speech at the Tea Party Convention on Feb. 6, 2010, Sarah Palin mocked some of the spending in the massive economic stimulus championed by President Barack Obama. "One state even spent a million bucks to put up signs that advertise that they were spending on the federal stimulus projects," Palin said. "Or as someone put it, this was a million-dollar effort using your money to tell you it's spending your money. And it didn't create a single job." Many stimulus projects are simply wasteful, she said. "And in the case of those signs," she said, "kind of ridiculous." The state in question here is clearly Ohio, which has been the subject of recent press reports on the subject. And the issue is over road signs along stimulus-funded highway projects that state: "Putting America to Work. Project Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act." The stimulus' implementation guidelines from the Federal Highway Administration "strongly encourages" (but does not require) the signs "to make it easier for Americans to see which projects are funded by the ARRA." The guidelines also provide precise details on the form and content of the sign and recovery logo. As far back as July, a number of Republican legislators, and some Democrats, criticized the signs as wasteful. Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin, mocking the red, blue and green logo of the stimulus, went so far as to label the signs “stimulus hype propaganda sporting the mark of the porkulus beast." As a result of the public pressure, a number of states balked at the federal recommendation to erect stimulus signs. Ohio was not one of them. The signs became something of a pet peeve of Republican Ohio state Sen. Tim Grendell, who drove daily past stimulus signs on both sides of a highway resurfacing project near his home. Grendell's complaints were aired in the Cleveland Plain Dealer on Sept. 9, 2009, along with the paper's estimate that the signs could cost up to $1 million in Ohio. But a more recent Jan. 26, 2010, report on CNN may also have caught Palin's attention. CNN also cited the $1 million price tag and attributed the figure to Grendell. So we called Grendell. He called the signs "self-congratulatory spin for the federal government and the Obama administration" and said the money could be better spent on many other worthy highway projects in Ohio. "It's a total waste of public dollars," he said. As for the $1 million figure, Grendell said he got that estimate from an Ohio Department of Transportation official when he called to complain about the signs. Since then, Grendell said he spoke to a company that rents some of the signs, and that they go for as much as $3,000 apiece. And with one on each side of a road project, that can run $6,000 per project. Scott Varner, a spokesman with the Ohio Department of Transportation, called the $1 million figure "inaccurate," although he said the state has no way of knowing the precise figure. The cost is rolled into the expense of all the construction signs in a construction zone, he said. The $1 million estimate, he said, is based on a "high-end" estimate of the cost of a sign ($2,000 to $3,000 apiece), multiplied by the number of projects. The cost of signs varies from project to project, he said, but the ODOT estimated the cost of a large sign at about $1,000 to $1,300 per sign (with the bulk of the cost in labor for installation and removal). In July, the Associated Press reported that Michigan estimated a sign costs $400 to $500. Illinois officials suggested $300 for the sign and an additional $700 when labor is included, while Colorado officials said materials plus labor would run between $750 and $1,200 per sign. The $1 million estimate in Ohio also assumes two signs per project, Varner said, and the reality is that many projects only got one sign; and many didn't get one at all. The estimate is also based on the cost of a large sign for interstate projects. Smaller, less expensive signs are used for city projects, he said. "That $1 million figure is at best on the high end," Varner said. "It's not a true number." It is more likely "significantly under that." The complaints by Grendell, and more recently Palin, also ignore the value of the signs, Varner said. Ohio placed a high priority on transparency and accountability with regard to stimulus projects, he said. "What better way to let people know where the stimulus dollars are being spent," he said. CNN polled other states and found at least 16 that are skipping the signs and putting the money toward road projects instead. One of the states that has opted against the signs is Vermont. In a blog posting, the state's chief recovery officer, Tom Evslin, said, "Here in Vermont we decided that we'd rather spend the stimulus highway dollars on roads than signs." All of the state's stimulus projects are listed on a state Web site, he said. "The Web is cheaper than signs." We think it's accurate for Palin to describe the signs as advertisements for spending on stimulus projects. That's exactly the point of them. We'll leave it up to legislators and the American public to decide whether that's an appropriate use of stimulus funds. But we can say the $1 million figure for signs in Ohio is suspect and appears to be a back-of-the-envelope estimate, rather than a hard fact. Ohio transportation officials said the total for signs is likely significantly lower than that. But neither Palin nor ODOT (nor anyone else for that matter) can cite an exact figure. And so we rate Palin's claim Half True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2010-02-08T19:48:12	2010-02-06	['None']
pomt-07717	"We've seen local union after local union rush to their school boards, their city councils, their technical school boards and rush through contracts in the past two weeks that had no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/03/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-local-public-unions-rushed-t/	The drum roll was building a little each day. On Feb. 24, 2011, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued a news release titled, "Union bosses say one thing, do another." The release charged that while union leaders were saying their members would contribute more to their pensions and kick in more for health insurance -- as called for in Walker’s budget repair bill -- they were actually signing local contracts that did neither. The governor banged the drum a little louder during a news conference that day, saying a variety of local governments were in a "rush to ram through employee contracts" that do not include the greater share from employees -- effectively a pay cut -- for health and pensions. Finally, Walker pounded the biggest drum yet, repeating the claim in response to the first question posed by moderator David Gregory during Walker’s appearance Feb. 27, 2011, on NBC’s "Meet the Press." "We’ve seen local union after local union rush to their school boards, their city councils, their technical school boards and rush through contracts in the past two weeks that had no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care," said Walker. "And, in fact, in one case in Janesville, they actually were pushing through a pay increase. Actions do speak louder than words." That’s a lot of drum beating. But is the truth taking a beating? Asked for backup on the statement, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie pointed to about a half dozen units of government that ratified contracts since Feb. 11, 2011 -- the day Walker released his budget-repair bill. "And those are the only ones we know about," he added. Walker’s bill contains demands for increased health premiums and contributions by government workers to their state retirement plans. The bill, which exempts most law enforcement and firefighters, would sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for most other employees. The changes would not apply to contracts in place at the time the bill is signed. So unions would have an incentive to cut a deal now for fear they will soon lose the ability to negotiate much of anything. We took the list provided by Walker and decided to check it twice to see who, according to the governor, has been naughty or nice. Let’s start with a key aspect of Walker’s statement. He said the newly ratified contracts had "no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care." While they do not meet the size of the contribution called for in Walker’s budget repair bill, each pact does include some employee contributions to health insurance. In Madison, however, the contract would require very few workers to contribute to their premiums. Now, let's look at the details of each contract cited, beginning in Walker’s new backyard. Madison: Unions in the state’s second biggest city have been negotiating contracts for more than a year. Their pacts expired at the beginning of 2010. Contracts with two of Madison’s biggest public unions settled before Walker was inaugurated Jan. 3, 2011, said Brad Wirtz, Madison human resources director. He said who said those deals set the template for the remaining unions, who reached agreement on wages and other key financial issues after Walker took office but before Feb. 11, when Walker announced his plan. The remaining issues were negotiated after Feb. 11, Wirtz said. Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz said the time frame presented a dilemma. He said he didn’t want to wait until the council's regularly scheduled meeting on Feb. 23, because he feared the Legislature would pass Walker’s budget-repair bill before that date. (This was before the 14 state Senate Democrats fled the state, blocking a vote on the bill.) That could have created a split in the work force, with one half better off than the other half. So, Cieslewciz, scheduled a special session of the the council for Feb. 17 and the contracts were ratified. He urged Secretary of State Doug La Follette to wait as long as possible before taking steps that would make the budget repair bill law – that is, if it had it been passed by the Senate. Cieslewicz said he was trying to avoid "having frozen in amber an inequitable situation" among city workers. Sheboygan County: Officials there are running the risk Madison dodged. Adam Payne, the county’s administrator, said the county approved a contract with the union representing nurses on Feb. 15, 2011 -- four days after Walker’s proposal. But, Payne said, the agreement between negotiators was struck before Feb. 11 and it mirrors pacts reached with other unions late last year. "There was no special treatment," Payne said noting the County Board approved the contract at a regularly scheduled meeting. Payne took offense at having his county listed on Walker’s ram-it-through list. In fact, he said, agreement on the contract covering courthouse workers has also been reached, but the County Board is not scheduled to act on it until March 15, 2011. Thus, depending on what happens at the Capitol -- and when it happens -- the county could be left with unions under different sets of rules, the scenario Madison avoided. Janesville schools: This Rock County city got a special mention on "Meet the Press" when Walker said, "in Janesville, they actually were pushing through a pay increase." Walker was right when he said the school board approved a contract that included a pay hike. Kevin Murray, a board member who helped negotiate the contracts, said the pact with custodial workers was ratified Feb. 22, 2011, but a second contract -- this one with secretarial workers -- isn’t scheduled for board action until March 8. The custodians, like the teachers before them, agreed to a pay freeze retroactive to the 2009-’10 school year, followed by three years of raises averaging about 2 percent per year. The pending contract for clerical workers has a one-year freeze followed by two annual raises of 2 percent each. All the contract expire at the end of the 2012-’13 school year. Murray said there was no rushing on Walker’s behalf. The tentative agreement for custodians was reached Jan. 25, 2011 -- before Walker’s proposals were made public. The tentative agreement with secretarial workers was reached Feb. 21, after Walker’s announcement. But, as in Sheboygan, the future of that agreement could hinge on what happens -- and when -- in the Capitol. Murray noted talks for the various contracts started in either 2010 or 2009, and all of the school union workers had been working without contracts. Said Murray: "We don’t believe we should not be ratifying these things because of what might come down from Madison." However, that feeling was not unanimous. The vote approving the custodial workers contract was 5-4, with the losing side arguing the board should wait to see what happens In Madison. Janesville city: The City of Janesville dealt with some of the same uncertainty when contracts with city workers, which also included pay increases, were ratified by the city and the unions after Walker made his announcement. Eric Levitt, city manager, said that in January he had set a mid-February target to settle contracts, so the talks continued on the previously set timetable. The two sides were close to reaching tentative agreements prior to Walker’s Feb. 11 announcement, Levitt said. He said the city felt that because of its obligation to negotiate in good faith, it was necessary to continue the talks after the governor made his call for increased payments by employees. La Crosse County: Agreements with seven of the county’s eight bargaining units were approved between Feb. 17 and 21, 2011, meaning both sides were aware of what Walker was up to. County Administrator Steve O’Malley argued the county didn’t rush things since negotiations started last year and the first tentative agreement with a local was reached in December. Racine: City Administrator Thomas Friedel said Walker is "technically correct but there were extenuating circumstances." He explained that Racine had been negotiating with bargaining units representing Department of Public Works and clerical workers since summer of 2010 and reached tentative agreements well before Walker made his move. The Common Council approved the pacts Feb. 15, 2011, which was the first available date after the unions approved the contracts, said Scott Letteney, assistant city attorney. . Friedel said the city felt to delay action after all the months of negotiation would be a breach of good faith bargaining that had already taken place. Milwaukee Area Technical College: Like all of the other governments, the technical college and the union representing teachers and other workers had been talking for months -- starting back when Walker was a candidate for governor. The board and the American Federation of Teachers Local 212 reached tentative agreement on Feb. 10 -- the day before Walker’s announcement. The agreement froze wages for two years but -- like the other contracts -- did not match Walker’s proposals on health insurance and pensions. Union president Michael Rosen said a negotiating session was originally scheduled for Jan. 31, 2011, but was delayed because an MATC negotiator broke his hand. The union membership approved the contract on Feb. 16 and the MATC board held a special meeting that night to ratify the contract. The board held a special meeting rather than voting on the contract at its regularly scheduled meeting the following week. Were they rushing things to beat the legislative clock? "Rush is such a subjective word," said Kathleen Hohl, the college’s communications director. Indeed it is. And it’s our job to figure out if it applies. On "Meet the Press," Walker said he seen "local union after local union rush ... through contracts in the past two weeks that had no contributions to the pension and no contribution to health care." While the contracts did not match the health care payment he is seeking, they did include health care increases. But what about the rush? Walker’s words suggest the situation was common, but his office provided only about half a dozen examples. The words also suggest late-night sessions to finalize deals, when each example cited involved negotiations that had been going on for months -- and in some cases were finalized before Walker’s budget-repair bill was unveiled. Two governmental bodies -- Madison and MATC -- tapped on the accelerator to get deals approved before state lawmakers could slam on the breaks. But two others, Janesville schools and Sheboygan County, are making their workers wait until the contracts are brought up for a vote at regularly scheduled board meetings. That doesn’t reflect the ram-it-through image Walker pointed to. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-03-03T15:02:44	2011-02-27	['None']

pomt-14230	In nine Democratic debates, "We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/15/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-democratic-debate-moderators-/	Hillary Clinton said abortion has been ignored during the Democratic debates. Clinton got on the topic during the April 14 debate in Brooklyn, N.Y., when she said she would only appoint a Supreme Court justice who believed that Roe vs. Wade is settled law. "And I want to say something about this since we're talking about the Supreme Court and what's at stake. We've had eight debates before, this is our ninth," Clinton said. "We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question." The line got a big applause from the audience. But was it correct? Abortion and debates We found no questions directly about abortion in nine debate transcripts, although at times the candidates brought up the topic themselves. We searched for the words "abortion," "Planned Parenthood" and "pro-choice" in debate transcripts in Washington Post transcripts: Oct. 13, Las Vegas: Clinton said the Republicans "don't mind having big government to interfere with a woman's right to choose and to try to take down Planned Parenthood." Nov. 14, Des Moines: Speaking about the Democratic candidates, Clinton said "all of us support funding Planned Parenthood." Dec. 19, New Hampshire: Clinton mentioned that a police officer was killed responding to "Planned Parenthood murders" and said that Republicans would defund Planned Parenthood. Jan. 17, South Carolina: No mentions. Feb. 4, New Hampshire: No mentions. Feb. 11, Milwaukee: No abortion questions were asked. Sanders said he had a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record, and Clinton touted her endorsement by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. March 6, Flint: No mentions. March 9, Miami: The candidates were not asked their views on abortion, but a moderator mentioned that the Supreme Court was considering "the most significant abortion restrictions in a generation." But the question was about what qualifications Clinton would look for in a Supreme Court justice. April 14, New York: In the ninth debate, Clinton said governors are trying to restrict women's rights and that Donald Trump said women should be punished for abortion. " And we are never asked about this," she said. "And to be complete in my concern, Sen. Sanders says with respect to Trump it was a distraction. I don't think it's a distraction. It goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks." Sanders replied: "You're looking at a senator and former congressman who proudly has a 100 percent pro-choice voting record, who will take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman's right to choose..." He called for expanding funding for Planned Parenthood. Several news articles including by the Washington Post, MSNBC, TIME, Vox stated that during the Democratic debates moderators haven’t asked about abortion. A spokesman for NARAL Pro-Choice America, James Owens, told PolitiFact, "It is correct that there has not been a single question about abortion in any of the Democratic debates." NARAL has advocated for Democratic moderators to ask about abortion, including a campaign on Twitter #AskAboutAbortion. Before the New York debate, NARAL sent a letter to CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer urging him to ask about abortion. Renee Bracey Sherman, a board member at NARAL, wrote a column for Glamour posted the day of the New York debate that argued that even though they both support abortion, there are questions that should be asked about their positions: "Will abortion be covered in Sanders’ Medicare-For-All plan? How will Clinton direct the Department of Justice to respond to the record number of attacks on providers? Will their administration step in to stop the prosecution of those who are self inducing their abortions? How will the candidates stop states from closing abortion clinics? Will their immigration policy ensure undocumented people are able to access abortion care? How will they ensure everyone is able to access safe, affordable abortion care in their community?" There was a town hall, however, where the moderator brought up abortion, a spokesman for Clinton told us. In a Fox News town hall March 7, moderator Brett Baier asked Sanders and Clinton questions about abortion. Baier asked Sanders: "Can you name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be OK with abortion being illegal?" Sanders replied: "I happen to believe that it is wrong for the government to be telling a woman what to do with her own body." He then posed a similar question to Clinton: "Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it's born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?" Clinton replied that she supports abortion rights. "I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother," she said. Our ruling Clinton says in nine Democratic debates "We've not had one question about a woman's right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question." We could not find any example of a moderator asking a direct question about abortion, however Clinton and Sanders both raised the topic in multiple debates. We rate this claim True.

pomt-11165	Says Bill Nelson is "one of America’s most independent senators."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/may/24/senate-majority-pac/bill-nelson-one-americas-most-independent-senators/	For weeks, Gov. Rick Scott has hammered incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson for voting with the most liberal members of Congress. But a new ad from a Democratic PAC supporting Nelson’s re-election bid portrays Nelson as an independent voice. "He served his country as an Army captain and as an astronaut on the shuttle Columbia," the narrator says. "And as one of America’s most independent senators, Bill Nelson has delivered for Florida." Scott, expected to be Nelson’s toughest re-election challenger yet, has repeatedly tried to poke holes in this characterization — saying that Nelson moved closer in step with the Democratic Party in recent years, a departure from his earliest days in the House. Given the competing claims before voters, we wanted to get to the bottom of his record. Is Bill Nelson one of America’s most independent senators, as the Senate Majority PAC says? While it’s difficult if not impossible to define independence, multiple studies show Nelson voted against his party more so than other Democrats. However, other experts cautioned that a moderate or centrist voting record does not necessarily equate to being independent. What do voting studies say? As evidence of this claim, the Senate Majority PAC cited a Congressional Quarterly voting study from 2017. According to that study, Nelson voted with his party 88 percent of the time during 2017. Only Sens. Joe Donnelly, Susan Collins, Angus King, Claire McCaskill, Jon Tester, Mark Warner and Joe Manchin voted with their party less often, according to that analysis. (The lowest percentage was 64 percent, from Manchin.) "In 2017, Nelson was tied with Senator (Tom) Carper in being ranked by CQ as the eighth-most independent senator," said spokesman Chris Hayden. Congressional Quarterly study didn’t actually rank the lawmakers by independence based on these findings. That’s just how political groups are framing it. Nelson has been in the Senate since 2001, so we wanted to take a longer view of his CQ average. The average of his CQ score for voting with the party is 89 percent. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com His lowest Senate scores came in 2002 and 2006, at 77 percent and 76 percent, respectively. His highest level of support was in 2013 and 2014, at 98 percent. Another analysis by voteview.com concluded Nelson was one of the most conservative Democrats while in office. (Political science experts have told PolitiFact Florida that voteview.com is the best site for mapping ideological locations for elected officials.) Session Vote View analysis 107th More conservative than 89 percent of Democrats 108th More conservative than 89 percent of Democrats 109th More conservative than 92 percent of Democrats 110th More conservative than 88 percent of Democrats 111th More conservative than 84 percent of Democrats 112th More conservative than 92 percent of Democrats 113th More conservative than 92 percent of Democrats 114th More conservative than 94 percent of Democrats 115th More conservative than 93 percent of Democrats The studies suggest Nelson votes with his party-line less than most other Democrats. But is that evidence he is "one of America’s most independent senators?" We reached out to several Florida political science experts for their take on the claim. One theme from their responses is that it’s hard to define and measure "independence." Steven Tauber, the director of the School of Interdisciplinary Global Studies at the University of South Florida, said "independence" is a subjective and multidimensional term. "If we equate independence with a ‘moderate’ or ‘centrist’ legislative record, then I think it is definitely fair to say that on his legislative record, Nelson is one of the independent members of the Senate," he said. However, being moderate or centrist does not always equate to being "independent." "To me, (independence) implies more than occasionally voting against one's party; it means speaking honestly and working with members of the other party on legislation," said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. "These are measurable things, but I don't know if anyone has done it yet." To bolster this idea, the Senate Majority PAC pointed to several newspaper editorials endorsing Nelson in his 2012 Senate run that touted his ability to work across the aisle. "Sen. Nelson has repeatedly shown an ability to work across the aisle on Florida’s behalf, the kind of voice Florida needs in the Senate," the Miami Herald editorial board wrote in 2012. "With Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, he successfully co-sponsored the legislation to ensure that NASA would remain committed to a space exploration program. And with former Republican Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida, he co-authored a bill to keep Florida’s beaches safe from oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico." The Fort Myers News-Press editorial said, "(Nelson) has a history of bipartisan cooperation, which is fundamental right now as Americans demand an end to gridlock, which threatens to take Americans off a fiscal cliff, come the end of the year due to expiring tax cuts." Nelson and fellow Republican Sen. Marco Rubio have worked together on numerous issues throughout the years. Most recently, the pair has co-authored letters regarding Puerto Rico, introduced a bill addressing the opioid epidemic and introduced legislation to proactively mitigate threats of violence at schools. Rubio has said he won’t campaign against Nelson but still supports Scott. How does the GOP’s argument fit in? Scott’s team has been watering down Nelson’s moderate image with claims that he has grown to be a definite party-line voter. To back this point up, Scott’s team compiled 28 years of party-unity voting data from Congressional Quarterly. That data shows Nelson started out voting an average of 50 percent in the 1980s with the Democratic party and now has voted with Democrats nearly 90 percent of the time for the past decade. The political environment has shifted substantially, to say the least, said Susan MacManus, a professor emeritus at the University of South Florida. It is isn’t just Nelson who has grown more partisan. "The increase is natural," she said. "Congress is more partisan." Our ruling The Senate Majority PAC said Nelson is "one of America’s most independent senators." There are multiple ways to conceptualize independence, so any claim stating that a lawmaker is independent requires context. If we liken independence with a "moderate" legislative record, then it is fair to say that on his legislative record, Nelson is one of the more independent Senate members. Analyses suggest Nelson voted with his party-line less than other Democrats. That said, experts cautioned there’s more that goes in to being an independent then just a moderate or centrist voting record — including having an open dialogue with both sides of the aisle, which can be hard to measure.

pomt-11401	"March For Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/23/national-rifle-association/nra-says-violent-radicals-are-behind-march-our-liv/	As the National Rifle Association sees it, the March For Our Lives taking place in Washington and in cities and communities nationwide, is a ploy to destroy the Second Amendment. On NRATV, host Grant Stinchfield said he is "committed to exposing the violent, even deadly history of these people behind this weekend’s March For Our Lives, anti-gun fraud of a protest." "March For Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions," Stinchfield said March 21. The key evidence behind that claim? Stinchfield argued that the Women’s March, the massive protest the day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump in January 2017, is "a major force behind" the March For Our Lives. He further argued that the Women’s March organization is run by radicals with violent tendencies. Stinchfield’s first example: Singer Madonna telling a crowd that she felt so frustrated after the election that she "thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House." ("But I know that this won't change anything," she quickly added.) We explored the facts behind each link in that chain of association. The organization behind the March For Our Lives defies easy description, but one thing is clear: As an organization, the Women’s March is not a big player. The Women’s March organizers The NRA broadcast mentioned Tamika Mallory, a Women’s March national co-chair. "She has nothing to do with this," said Allan Mayer, co-CEO of 42West, the public relations firm for March For Our Lives. The NRA listed another Women’s March co-chair, Linda Sarsour. "Absolutely no connection to what we’re doing," Mayer said. NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam pointed to an article on Bustle, a news, entertainment and beauty website, describing how the youth engagement arm of the Women’s March was promoting gun control activism. That’s true. The youth organizers have posted a detailed gun control policy including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. They promoted the National School Walkout protest in mid March and provided a toolkit for young organizers who wanted to hold their own local events. But their website has only a single mention of the March For Our Lives. It is the 14th point on a page about the school walkout and says "We will be at #March4OurLives too!" It adds, "It will take sustained action to end gun violence and we stand in solidarity with our peers who are also organizing around gun violence prevention." The clearest link to the Women’s March comes in the person of Deena Katz, a producer of Dancing With the Stars and a co-executive director of the Women’s March Los Angeles Foundation. Through a personal connection to a family in Parkland, Fla., the site of the deadly school shooting, Katz stepped in early to work with the student activists at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Katz applied as an individual for the permits to march in Washington. She is the president of the March For Our Lives Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit established to fund the march and future lobbying on gun control. But Mayer at 42West said Katz is doing this on her own, separate from the Los Angeles Women’s March group. A spokesperson for the LA group told Buzzfeed in February that the organization itself was not involved. March supported by gun control groups The march has been a magnet for the many advocacy organizations that have pressed for gun control over many years. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and Sandy Hook Promise all promote the march. Two organizations, Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords Courage to Fight, are playing a prominent role in organizing sibling marches around the country and providing logistical muscle for the main march in Washington. Everytown — along with its grassroots organizing arm Moms Demand Action — has funded local marches, and maintains an interactive map showing where they are taking place. Everytown for Gun Safety receives significant support from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Giffords Courage to Fight emerged after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and is the project of gun victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and her husband Mark Kelly. The liberal activist group MoveOn and Planned Parenthood also actively support the march. Planned Parenthood lists 14 local marches on its website. The Episcopal Diocese of Washington is coordinating housing and meals for out-of-town visitors. March For Our Lives has had no trouble securing hefty donations from Hollywood stars, companies and philanthropists. George and Amal Clooney pledged $500,000, a sum that was quickly matched by Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw, and others. The Italian fashion company Gucci gave $500,000, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff pledged $1 million, as did billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad. The march also raised more than $3 million online through a GoFundMe campaign. Our ruling The NRA said that the March For Our Lives is "backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions." That allegation rested on the idea that the Women’s March played a major role in the march, and the NRA host mentioned two co-chairs by name. We found no evidence that either the organization or those people are directly involved in the march. The Women’s March website doesn’t even list the gun control march as an upcoming event. The only significant tie between the marches is a producer who leads the Los Angeles chapter of the Women’s March. But the chapter said it is not involved, and the producer has acted on her own to apply for permits and establish the March For Our Lives’ nonprofit support fund. Major organizational muscle behind the march, both in Washington and in cities nationwide, comes from two well-known gun control advocacy groups, neither of which has a history of violent behavior. A number of related organizations have lent their support, including the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and celebrity donors have given millions of dollars. The NRA claim is without merit. We rate it Pants on Fire. Correction: After we published, a reader noted that the Youth Empowerment FAQ page on National School Walkout included a reference to the March For Our Lives. The fact-check has been corrected to reflect that reference. We also updated the story to reflect Madonna's full quote from the 2017 Women's March.

pomt-06690	Says Jon Huntsman supports changes in Medicare that would deny guaranteed benefits to 980,000 New Hampshire residents.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/06/new-hampshire-democratic-party/democratic-party-says-huntsman-supports-medicare-p/	The latest Democratic effort to paint Republicans as Medicare destroyers is a bit more nuanced than previous attempts that have faced our Truth-O-Meter and it points to a core truth about Medicare -- although not one that would make every Democrat happy. On the eve of a visit to the Granite State by GOP presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman, Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley said, "he [Huntsman] has even signed on to the GOP's extreme proposal to end Medicare as we know it, which would deny guaranteed benefits to 980,000 Granite Staters." For this fact-check, we're going to examine whether Huntsman supports the Republican Medicare plan from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan and whether it indeed would end "guaranteed benefits" to the 980,000 people. The Huntsman campaign told us that Huntsman considers the Ryan plan a "good step forward." The Democrats quote him telling ABC News that "I would have voted for it." If Huntsman wanted to put some distance between himself and the Ryan plan, he’s had his opportunities and he hasn’t done it. So Buckley is correct on this point. And as for the 980,000, that is roughly the population of people in New Hampshire under 55, the age group that would be affected by the Ryan plan. (It leaves current Medicare intact for people 55 and older.) Democrats elsewhere have ended up on the wrong end of the Truth-O-Meter for saying that Republicans "voted to end" Medicare. The Ryan proposal would certainly make fundamental changes in Medicare. It turns Medicare from a defined benefit program into a defined contribution program so by definition, benefits would no longer be the foundation from which everything else follows. The Ryan plan says "future Medicare recipients will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, and they will be given the ability to choose a plan that works best for them." So there will be a list of benefits but beyond that, the plan provides few details. Also, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, people would end up paying more for health care under the Ryan plan. That might not be the same as being denied coverage for a particular service, but people may opt out of coverage to save money. Where Democrats get into the most trouble is in their use of the word "guaranteed". It’s a loaded word and unpacking it takes us to the nut of the Medicare conundrum. The New Hampshire state committee got its language from the analysis of the Ryan plan by the Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. That report refers frequently to guaranteed benefits, as in "Medicare provides essential guaranteed benefits for all who qualify and enroll." In assessing the impacts of the GOP plan, House Democrats refer to an analysis of the Ryan proposal from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan body that crunches numbers for Congress. Curiously, the CBO letter never speaks of benefits as guaranteed. Instead, it uses the term "standardized benefit," which the CBO describes as the most average level of services used by the most typical Medicare patient. Other analysts also shun the word "guaranteed." Paul Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, an independent research group cited by both Republicans and Democrats, said in the context of Medicare, "I’ve never heard the word ‘guaranteed’ before," adding that, "policy wonks like me talk in terms of Medicare being a defined benefit program." Ginsburg means that written into the actual Medicare law, you are entitled to those services. To Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a group that views health care as a basic human right, the situation is clear. "The Medicare program does guarantee a set of benefits," Baker said. For our purposes at PolitiFact, the difference between an entitlement and a guarantee feels pretty small and it seems reasonable to use the terms interchangeably. But if the Democratic vocabulary is sound, it also masks a challenge that confronts Democrats just as much as Republicans -- how much is the country willing to pay for Medicare in the future? Or to put it another way, are those guaranteed benefits as rock solid as the Democratic language implies? When they talk about 980,000 New Hampshire residents losing benefits, that includes kids who are babies today. The Democrats would have us believe that what Washington promises today will be in place 65 years from now. Even Joe Baker with the Medicare Rights Center said that "Congress could rewrite the law and say we are not covering this service or that service from this day forward." That’s simply a legal fact of life. So the "guarantee" Buckley refers to is not ironclad. Bob Moffit, a health care economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, goes further. Moffit argues that the Democrats’ signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, has already put the wheels in motion to undermine the services that Democrats say they want to protect. Moffit zeros in on the law’s measures to rein in Medicare spending. The law already includes $400 billion in provider cuts over ten years and it pegs program dollars to an inflation rate and economic growth as measured by GDP. The general consensus is that to avoid blowing past those limits will require even deeper cuts in how much Medicare pays doctors and hospitals. The ACA has a mechanism to explore those kinds of savings -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board. It would be able to recommend provider payment cuts that would be put on a fast-track through Congress. If Congress failed to act, the recommendations would go into place. "The net effect might be," Moffit said, "you might have a rich benefit package, but if the physician payment is too low, you just don't get those services because no one will provide them to you at the Medicare price." By Moffit’s logic, the Democrats offer no more of a guarantee than the Republicans. He said the Democrats would use the back door of lower reimbursement rates and it would be the providers turning people away, not the government. Ginsburg disagrees with Moffit. "It’s a legitimate point to be raising," Ginsburg said, "but it has never happened." For hospitals, Medicare is such a large part of their business, even in the face of lower reimbursement they find ways to deliver the care. Their other choice, dropping out of Medicare altogether, would be a financial disaster. But when it comes to the long view on Medicare, Ginsburg doesn’t let the Democrats off the hook. He believes the country can’t afford Medicare as we know it. "The Democrats disappoint me," he said, "in not coming up with their alternative that addresses the affordability problem." Our Ruling The New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair said Huntsman supports a GOP Medicare plan that would deny guaranteed benefits to 980,000 Granite Staters. He’s right about Huntsman's position and the number of New Hampshire residents that would be affected. But he ignores that there is the possibility that the current benefits could be trimmed and he is exaggerating the facts about the Ryan plan. Many details about the plan are still unclear, particularly what would be covered. The use of the word "guarantee" suggests something more certain in the future than is supported by the current state of the economy and the health care law. It suggests that hard choices for somebody don’t lie ahead and that’s not very likely. We rule the statement Half True.

pomt-10563	Americans "have never paid more for gas at the pump."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/11/barack-obama/he-needs-a-fill-up-on-statistics/	At a campaign rally at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va., on Feb. 10, 2008, Barack Obama opened his speech by talking about how Americans are feeling squeezed by the price of college, health care and gasoline. "They've never paid more for gas at the pump," he said. A month and a half ago, we found Obama was inaccurate for a similar statement, but we thought we should take another look. A check of the latest numbers finds he is still wrong. The Feb. 4 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration found the average price of gasoline was $2.98 a gallon, down 23 cents from the peak of $3.22 last May 21. In fact, while the senator was in Alexandria, his motorcade drivers could have filled up for $2.92 a gallon at Barber's Auto Service Center, an Exxon station near the school. We might have been inclined to cut Obama some slack for speaking in general terms about the price of gas, but he is still wrong when you look at historical levels. If you adjust for inflation, the current national price is still 41 cents below the peak of $3.39 per gallon, set in March 1981. And so, we find his statement False.

pomt-07430	Says salaries and benefits for Wisconsin state employee comprised 8.5 percent of the 2009-2011 state budget.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/24/mark-pocan/wisconsin-rep-mark-pocan-says-salaries-and-benefit/	When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took aim at public employees with his now-famous budget-repair bill, he used stark rhetoric to make a case for curtailing collective bargaining and making employees pay more for health care and pensions. "I don't have anything to negotiate. We are broke in this state," Walker said in February 2011, making a claim we ruled False. "We have been broke for years. People have ignored that for years, and it's about time somebody stood up and told the truth. The truth is: We don't have money to offer." A week later, state Rep. Mark Pocan -- who drew a False from us for claiming Walker’s $3.6 billion estimate of the state budget deficit was "bogus" -- took aim at the Republican governor. In a Feb. 19, 2011 blog post titled "Scott Walker’s top ten lies," Pocan tried to shred Walker’s rationale for the budget-repair bill, which would reduce the deficit but is now tied up in court. The Madison Democrat, a 13-year lawmaker, had this to say about what he labeled lie No. 9: "Walker has said that our budget problems are largely due to employee wages. Not even close, Governor. Total salaries and compensation in the last budget were 8.5 percent of the entire state budget." Pocan’s claim got national exposure when it was re-posted two days later on the liberal DailyKos.com, a leading political website. Although the claim was made weeks ago, it remains relevant. How much state employees cost taxpayers is central to the debate over their compensation and collective bargaining powers -- and we still get reader requests to check it out. So we did. Pocan’s assertion that employee wages and benefits comprise 8.5 percent of the state budget contained an asterisk, leading readers to a footnote. The footnote said the 8.5 percent figure came from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, but that the figure excluded the University of Wisconsin System and the Department of Corrections, which includes the state prisons. Those are two massive state operations. So, right off the bat, Pocan’s claim is dubious. If employees in major departments are not included, it’s going to make the overall cost of wages and benefits seem smaller. Indeed, the footnote -- which did not explain why the two areas were excluded -- said that when the UW System and corrections are considered, employee compensation costs make up 17.7 percent of the state budget. We wanted to see the Legislative Fiscal Bureau report that Pocan cited as his source, but Pocan refused to provide it. The bureau also would not provide the report, saying it was confidential to the lawmaker who requested it. The Legislature Fiscal Bureau is generally regarded as the gold standard in financial matters of the state. But without seeing the bureau’s report, we don’t know what information it was asked to generate and we can’t see how it arrived at the two percentages cited by Pocan. So, we sought out other sources. Dale Knapp, research director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, cited the state’s 2010 Annual Fiscal Report, which shows that "general purpose revenue," or the general fund budget, was $12.8 billion. He also cited the state’s 2010 personal services and fringe benefit report, which showed that spending on salaries and benefits was $2.22 billion. That means salaries and benefits were 17.3 percent of the state budget. That’s more than double Pocan’s 8.5 percent claim (though nearly the same as the 17.7 percent figure cited in his footnote.) Since Pocan’s blog post attacked Walker, we also asked the governor’s office to weigh in. It provided a memo issued by the state budget office, which is part of Walker’s administration. The memo was issued to "interested parties" on Feb. 9, 2011, two days before Walker introduced his budget-repair bill. The memo said employee compensation costs were $2.11 billion, nearly the same as Knapp’s $2.22 billion. However, the memo compared the employee costs to the "state operations" budget, which is only $3.67 billion, to conclude that employee costs make up 60 percent of that budget. What’s going on here? The compensation numbers are being compared against two different measures of state spending. State operations covers only the UW System, corrections, the courts and other state departments -- in other words, direct services provided by state employees. The overall budget includes some $9 billion more that the state takes in and distributes to local governments, schools and individuals. We asked two other government finance experts for guidance. Milwaukee County Auditor Jerome Heer said the method used to calculate the 17 percent figure is reliable because it takes into account not only what the state spends to provide direct services but also what it sends to local governments and to individuals. City of Milwaukee Deputy Comptroller Mike Daun said there is value in the method used to calculate the 60 percent figure in that it relates only to the employee costs as a percentage of direct services. However, both agreed Pocan’s 8.5 percent figure does not reflect the share of the state budget that goes to salaries and benefits. Let’s sum up. Pocan claimed in a blog post that salaries and benefits for state employees comprise 8.5 percent of the state budget. He did not provide evidence for the figure. In a footnote, Pocan acknowledged that two huge state operations -- the university system and corrections -- were not included, and that if they were, the figure is about 17 percent. The Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance agreed with the 17 percent, while the state budget office argued that the figure is 60 percent. Experts said the two figures are different ways to express what employees cost. But everyone agreed that Pocan’s 8.5 percent -- the main number he used, which was repeated elsewhere -- is not accurate. We rate Pocan’s statement False. (Editor's note: On April 25, 2011, the day after this item was published, Rep. Mark Pocan wrote in a blog post that we incorrectly stated in the item he refused to provide a memo that he relied on in making his claim about employee compensation. We have searched for the email on this end, including having the Journal Sentinel’s IT department check all filters for an email sent at the time in question, and have no record of receiving it. Our practice is to link to all of the source documents we use on items and would have done so with the memo Pocan requested from the fiscal bureau. The document in question simply reiterates the numbers that were cited. Thus, they do not affect the False ruling -- which Rep. Pocan has not challenged. Here is a summary of our efforts to reach Rep. Pocan for his input on this item: We emailed him April 8, 2011, asking for evidence he had to support his claim. We didn't get a reply, so we emailed him again April 12, and then emailed and called him on April 14. In the phone conversation, Pocan said he relied on a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo in making his claim, but said that he would not send us the memo. We sent another email the same day, asking Pocan to reconsider. That is all reflected in the email Rep. Pocan said he sent to us, which is linked in his follow up post on his blog. Pocan also linked to the memo.)	None	Mark Pocan	None	None	None	2011-04-24T09:00:00	2011-02-19	['Wisconsin']
pomt-04868	Says Mitt Romney and Bain Capital are to blame in a woman’s premature death when they closed the plant where her husband worked.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/09/priorities-usa-action/pro-obama-group-blames-romney-womans-death/	An ad from a pro-Obama super PAC suggests that Mitt Romney is responsible for a woman's death. The TV ad by Priorities USA Action has Joe Soptic, who has been used in Obama campaign ads, telling the story of what happened to his wife after Mitt Romney’s company, Bain Capital, closed the GST Steel plant where Soptic worked until 2001. On the screen are these words: "Mitt Romney and Bain Capital made millions for themselves and then closed this steel plant." Soptic says "I lost my health care. And my family lost their health care. And a short time after that my wife became ill.I don’t know how long she was sick. And I think maybe she didn’t say anything because she knew we couldn’t afford the insurance. And then one day she became ill and I took her up to the Jackson County Hospital and admitted her for pneumonia and that’s when they found the cancer. And by then, it was Stage 4. There was nothing they could do for her. And she passed away in 22 days." Without ever saying so directly, the ad leaves a very clear impression that Romney’s actions led to the premature death of Soptic’s wife. This is a powerful emotional attack on Romney and leads us to ask, do Romney and Bain Capital bear responsibility for Joe Soptic’s loss? Bill Burton, a former Obama aide who is the head of Priorities USA Action, appeared on CNN to defend the ad on Aug. 8, 2012, and denied that the ad suggests that Romney is responsible for the early death of Soptic’s wife. "We would never make that case," Burton said. But we find that preposterous. The force of the ad’s narrative is inescapable. The story begins with the plant closing and ends with a woman’s death. And there are problems with the sequence it presents. The tale of GST Steel This is not the first time Romney’s opponents have focused on the demise of GST Steel. Last spring, an Obama ad said that after Romney and Bain bought the struggling firm, they loaded it with debt, took millions in profits and then shut it down. PolitiFact rated that ad Mostly True. With Romney at the helm, Bain purchased GST Steel in 1993 for $75 million, and renamed it GS Technologies Inc. GS Technologies announced plans to spend $98 million modernizing the Kansas City plant where Soptic worked and in 1995, issued $125 million in bonds to pay for a merger with another wire rod maker in South Carolina. Plans were put in place to take the company public, but other problems intervened. In April 1997, the company faced its first labor strike in 40 years. The walkout stretched over 10 weeks, becoming bitter, divisive and sometimes violent. Then prices for electricity and natural gas skyrocketed. A power bill in September 1998 was more than double what it had been in 1997, a costly increase because the plant depended so heavily on electrical equipment. Meanwhile, a flood of cheap steel imports drove down prices in the late ‘90s, the company reported. In 1998, it worked with other steel companies and United Steelworkers of America to petition the government for limits on wire rod imports. In 2001, GS Technologies filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. The former GST Steel plant shut down and about 750 workers lost their jobs and their health insurance. By this point, Romney was running the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and from all indications, played no direct role in the final decision to close the Kansas City plant. The Los Angeles Times reported that Bain had more than doubled its money on the deal, pocketing some $26 million. Is Romney responsible? The latest ad hammers Romney for causing long term misery in Kansas City, Mo., where GST Steel was located. The misery of layoffs is indisputable, as are the profits Bain and Romney accumulated. It is in the nature of a free-market economy that within a single business deal, some people can walk away poor while a few others walk away wealthy. But it is not so clear that Bain’s actions alone brought the plant down. Rising costs and cheap steel products from Asia left many American steel fabricators uncompetitive. GST Steel was far from the only firm to go belly up. We asked Priorities USA Action if the plant would have survived under any circumstances. They told us that no one knows for sure but it didn’t help when Bain took millions out of the company. Joe Soptic said in the ad that when the plant closed, "my family lost their health care." Yet Soptic’s wife had insurance for about a year or two after that through her own employer, according to CNN, a fact that Burton's group acknowledges. Soptic said, "A short time after that (the closing of the plant), my wife became ill." But that's collapsing the time frame. The illness took place in 2006, some five years after Soptic lost his job, according to POLITICO. The connection between Soptic’s job, his wife’s lack of insurance and her illness is complicated. She had no insurance because a shoulder injury caused her to leave a job that provided coverage. That was the immediate reason for her being uninsured, not the plant closure. As for the impact of not having insurance, there is a large body of evidence that shows a strong relationship between a lack of health insurance and premature death. A 2009 report from the Institute of Medicine assessed scores of studies on this topic. Among its conclusions: Uninsured adults are more likely than insured adults to be diagnosed at an advanced stage of cancer. That might fit with the story of Soptic’s wife, but we don’t know the medical details of her case. Surprisingly, the Romney camp itself said that the lack of health insurance might have played a role. Spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in a Fox News interview that "if people had been in Massachusetts, under Governor Romney’s health care plan, they would have had health care." Other fact-checkers have examined the ad and found little if any evidence to support the suggestion that Romney is to blame. FactCheck.org called it misleading. CNN said it was "not accurate." Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post FactChecker, gave it four Pinocchios saying it "stretches the bounds of common sense and decency." On a side note, the ad’s emotional message and the questions raised about its accuracy prompted the Obama campaign to distance itself from the ad. Asked if the campaign thought it was appropriate for a third-party group to tie Romney to the death of a woman, spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the Obama team had "no involvement with any ads that are done by Priorities USA. We don’t have any knowledge of the story of the family." That reply struck some as implausible. The Obama campaign had featured Soptic in a previous ad and campaign officials had participated in a briefing with reporters where Soptic had talked about his wife. Our ruling The ad from Priorities USA Action offers one man’s story to suggest the investment practices of Romney and Bain Capital led to the early death of his wife. We believe Romney bears responsibility for the general practices of Bain Capital and the record is clear that in Kansas City, Bain profited while many people suffered. But there is little to support the ad's innuendo that Bain is responsible for the early death of the steel worker’s wife. The cancer came several years after he lost his job and her lack of coverage was not due solely to her husband losing his health insurance. We don’t know if the steel mill would have survived given overseas competition. It’s possible that Bain might have extended the life of the firm. And even the makers of the ad agree that it would be wrong to say Romney is responsible for the woman’s early death. The ad uses innuendo for a serious allegation, but there's no proof directly linking the death to Bain. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12909	"In the last decade, 73% of new jobs (in Wisconsin) have come from Madison."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jan/19/mark-pocan/pocan-wrongly-claims-last-decade-73-new-jobs-wisco/	After another congressman slammed Madison as a "communist" city, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, offered up a defense built on the city’s economic muscle. The spat began when U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, a Republican, referred to the "progressive, liberal, communist community of Madison" while discussing how Dane County opted for a hand tally during the presidential recount. The comments came in a December appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News. Duffy implied on Twitter he was joking, but Pocan wasn’t laughing. The Democrat went on the same show Dec. 8, 2016, to demand an apology and defend the state’s capital city. "In the last decade, 73 percent of new jobs (in Wisconsin) have come from Madison," Pocan said in the appearance. "I don’t know if that’s exactly the way I look at communists. We actually have a very vibrant private sector." Is one Wisconsin city really responsible for nearly three-fourths of the job growth over the last 10 years? Let's check the numbers. Problems with geography, specificity The claim runs into immediate trouble since Pocan referred to the wrong geographic area. Spokesman David Kolovson said Pocan meant to say Dane County was responsible for 73% of jobs, not Madison. He noted two news releases Pocan issued on the topic attributed that number to Dane County. Slightly more than half of Dane County lives outside Madison, so it’s an important difference. Pocan also referred on TV to "73 percent of new jobs," when the figures he is citing actually address net job growth. Pocan’s phrasing implies he has data on where each new job in the state was created, when he is actually referring to the change in total employment — how many people had jobs at one point in time compared to another. Job figures don’t match Pocan’s claim As for the 73 percent figure, let’s first look at what Pocan actually said — that the City of Madison was responsible for 73 percent of growth. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates Madison added a net of 13,000 jobs from 2006-’16, while the state added 87,000. That would be 15 percent of the statewide growth — far less than Pocan asserted. Those numbers come from the bureau’s Local Area Unemployment Statistics, which uses household-level data and surveys to estimate the labor force, employment and unemployment numbers. It’s the only dataset with city-level data. But what about the number Pocan was intending to cite (and did cite in news releases), attributing the increase to Dane County? It’s closer, but still off. Bureau of Labor Statistics Economist Steve Hipple said a different dataset, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, is the best measure of job growth. That is based on state unemployment insurance filings and produces county and state-level employment figures. The latest available employment data, through the second quarter of 2016, shows Dane County is responsible for 58 percent of the state’s job growth from 2006-’16. Dan Kennelly, manager of Madison’s Office of Business Resources, said the number is that high largely due to the Great Recession. Dane County was significantly less affected than the rest of the state, he said. "If you look at more recent years, the statewide numbers look significantly stronger compared to Dane County," Kennelly said. "This is likely because while Dane County’s economy stayed relatively strong through the recession, the statewide economy took a bigger dive and therefore had a deeper hole to climb out of during the recovery over the last few years." Kolovson, the Pocan spokesman, said the 73 percent figure came from a presentation made by Madison city development officials at a September 2014 symposium. That presentation said 73 percent of "net new jobs" created in Wisconsin from 2004-’14 were in Dane County. So the data is at least two years old, and not in line with Pocan’s reference to it as being "in the last decade." And the number is wrong for that timespan anyhow. Kennelly, who did the calculations behind the 73 percent figure, said he used the same Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. But the symposium occurred with three months left in 2014. Full-year data for 2004-14 shows Dane County accounted for 55 percent of the job growth statewide in that span. Our rating In his defense of Madison, Pocan highlighted the area’s job creation by saying the city is responsible for 73 percent of new jobs in the state over the last decade. But his claim attributed Dane County data to Madison, referred to "new jobs" when he meant job growth and was built on two-year-old data that is wrong itself. We rate his claim False.

Ted Cruz has been openly opposed to same-sex marriage, but he didn’t blame gay people for mass shootings and public nudity during a 2014 speech. A 2015 viral image that falsely quotes Cruz is gaining traction again on social media as incumbent Cruz looks to keep his seat in the 2018 Texas Senate race against Democrat Beto O’Rourke. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The false image originates from the now defunct Facebook page "Stop the world: Teabaggers want to get off." "When gays stayed hidden we had no mass shootings; we had no public nudity," the meme says Cruz said. "Society was polite. Now anything and everything goes and I blame them." PolitiFact and its affiliates fact-checked several similar memes about Cruz from that Facebook page when it was active in 2015. We rated those Cruz-related memes Pants on Fire or False. This claim is no different. The meme says Cruz made this statement during his speech at a 2014 Conservative Political Action Committee conference. We watched a video of the speech. He does not mention gay people, mass shootings or public nudity. The original Facebook page had an About section that says the page "is for entertainment purposes" and is "primarily satire and parody with a mix of political memes and messages." However, the meme that’s reappeared on social media three years later does not have this disclaimer attached. Cruz didn’t blame public nudity or mass shootings on gay people.

pomt-13221	Says Hillary Clinton is "wrong" to say he mocked a disabled reporter.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-wrong-say-he-moc/	Once again, a comment by Donald Trump has become a point of contention in a presidential debate. This time, it revolved around remarks Trump made almost a year ago about a disabled reporter. At one point in the third presidential debate in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton said, "He also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television." Trump interrupted, "Wrong." So who’s right? Here’s the background, which we have looked at before. At at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24, 2015, Trump referred to New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. At the time, Trump was taking heat for his widely debunked claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as "thousands and thousands of people were cheering" the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. To defend this account, Trump cited a Sept. 18, 2001, story co-written by Kovaleski, who was a Washington Post reporter at the time. Near the bottom of the story, the Post reporters wrote that "law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river." However, the reporters couldn’t verify the celebrations actually occurred, as Kovaleski later explained. "I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember," Kovaleski told the Washington Post Fact Checker in November 2015. Remember, Kovaleski wrote that "a number of people" -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating. At the rally where he discussed Kovaleski, Trump said, "You gotta see this guy" and wildly flailed his arms, his right hand flopping at an odd angle as he shouted in a weird, agitated voice: "Ahh, I don’t know what I said! Ahh, I don’t remember!" Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition which limits the movement of his joints and has left his right hand sharply angled at the wrist. Kovaleski speaks with a normal voice and doesn't wave his arms around. (Watch a video of him talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.) Many observers took Trump’s comments and motions as mocking Kovaleski. The New York Times rebuked Trump in a statement: "We think it's outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters." And people who share Kovaleski’s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag "AMCStrong." Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, said that Trump "clearly was mocking his disability. That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn't use that voice or wave his arms like that." (Reiskin said she was giving her view since her nonprofit group can't endorse or oppose candidates.) Reiskin said such behavior by Trump "portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can't control your speech or part of your body that you're not competent, which is very destructive" to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added. But Trump denied it. He tweeted, "Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!" He also said in a statement at the time, "I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago." Trump insisted that he couldn’t have known the man was disabled because "I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. … Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him." Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the Washington Post he was sure the businessman remembered him -- and his condition. "Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years," Kovaleski told the New York Times. In fact, Kovaleski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the "inaugural voyage" of the Trump Shuttle airline. In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovaleski at the rally, calling him a "nice reporter." He also described him as "the poor guy" and indicated he knew Kovaleski’s appearance ("you gotta see this guy") before launching into his imitation. After our fact-check appeared, the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed both Trump’s original comments and subsequent ones he made on the same subject in Colorado. The Fact Checker concluded that "Trump clearly mocked Kovaleski" and it gave Trump its lowest rating, Four Pinocchios. In the meantime, some Trump supporters have shared other examples in which Trump has shaken his hands and used an odd tone of voice to refer to other people. In one video, Trump is shown referring to one of his primary rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, with flailing arms and an exaggerated voice. (See it here.) In another, he uses similar, if more subdued, motions when referring to an unnamed general. (See it here.) However, neither of these examples support Trump’s denial in the debate. In the videos, Trump was clearly mocking both Cruz and the unnamed general. In fact, the video about the general -- produced by a Trump supporter -- says explicitly that he was mocking the general. In other words, the most you could say about these bits of evidence is that they demonstrate that Trump is an equal-opportunity mocker. They don’t help refute Clinton’s charge that Trump mocked Kovaleski. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry after the debate. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton is "wrong" to say he mocked a disabled reporter. Trump may deny that he intentionally mocked Kovaleski for his disability, but many Americans believe his remarks amounted to mocking, and we concur that that’s a reasonable -- indeed, perhaps the only -- interpretation of his actions. The notion that Trump’s comments about Cruz and a general undercut Clinton’s claim don’t hold water, because all three examples constitute mocking, whether a disability was involved or not.

pomt-04455	Says Bill Nelson sold agricultural land "for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/oct/10/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-says-bill-nelson-sold-pasture-/	A hokey political commercial from the conservative super PAC American Crossroads lambasts Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as a politician who has gotten out of paying property taxes. "After 40 years in politics, Bill Nelson has learned how to milk the system. He leased land that he owned for six cows, taking advantage of an agricultural tax loophole to dodge $43,000 in taxes just last year," the narrator says. "Then he sold the land for home development, pocketing at least $1.4 million." The kicker: "Tax breaks and big profits for him, higher taxes for the rest of us." We rated the group’s claim that Nelson is using Florida’s greenbelt assessment to "dodge" taxes Half True. Here, we will look at whether he sold the land for home development for at least $1.4 million. The greenbelt exemption As evidence for the ad, Crossroads spokesman Nate Hodson referred us to a February 2012 Tampa Bay Times story that scrutinized Nelson’s qualifications for a "greenbelt" assessment, which spares him from paying higher taxes on his family’s 55-acre pasture along the Indian River. Instead of paying taxes on the market value, his tax bill is based on a much lower agricultural assessment. Nelson gets the greenbelt assessment for his Brevard County pasture because he leases the land to a small-time cattle owner. The current lessee, cattleman Jeff Darby, has a herd of about six cows and uses the land free of charge, though he is tasked with maintenance. The greenbelt law was enacted in 1959 as a financial incentive for farmers to keep their land as developers bought up farm land for malls, highways and homes. Without the lower agricultural rate, Nelson would have paid about $43,000 in higher taxes on the land. The ad gives voters the impression that Nelson parked some cows on land to save money on his taxes and then axed the cows in a land sale to developers. (The ad sends the cows flying with the arrival of a new brick house from the sky.) Such a move obviously goes against the spirit of the greenbelt law, though it’s legal, and it happens. The problem with the greenbelt law, critics say, is that it’s written too broadly. Under the law, county property appraisers are tasked with determining if the land is used "primarily for bona fide agricultural purposes." The Brevard County property appraiser’s office has tried to remove Nelson’s greenbelt designation in the past, but Nelson fought to keep it and won in court. (An inspector in 1999 went to his property and found no cows; Nelson argued they escaped via a hole in the fence.) Nelson’s land sales The ad leaves out a lot of important context about that $1.4 million profit that Nelson supposedly gained from land sales. When Nelson moved to Tallahassee in the mid ’90s to serve on the state Cabinet, he sold the main house that he lived in, which is adjacent to the pasture. He sold four more nearby lots after he moved to Washington, D.C., to serve as a U.S. senator. Two of these were residential lots that had houses on them. Two more were lots that he cut out of his pastureland, so those had used the greenbelt exemption. The total for these four transactions to private homeowners is at least $1.4 million, the Times reported. Florida’s greenbelt law does not require him to pay back part of his tax break. Nelson’s campaign does not dispute the $1.4 million total -- they do dispute how American Crossroads presented the transactions. That total does not represent all of the money he received from the agricultural lots; it also includes the sales of two residential lots. The ad is leading viewers to equate the land that got the tax break with the land he sold for $1.4 million, and that’s plainly wrong. Nelson did not sell the entire pasture. The cows still graze on it, and Nelson has indicated that will not change for the land his family has had since 1924. "I've looked at all the options on the rest of the property and I've decided not to develop it. I want to leave it to my kids," Nelson told the Times in February. Our ruling It’s not fully accurate for Crossroads to say Nelson took land that was receiving agricultural tax breaks and sold it for "home development" at a profit of $1.4 million. For one, the land that earned the tax break -- a 55-acre pasture -- is still a pasture. He did not sell that land "for home development." Nelson has sold two agricultural lots, but those sales do not total $1.4 million. To get there, you have to factor in two more sales of residential lots adjoining the pasture. Those lots already had homes on them when Nelson sold them. American Crossroads is cherry-picking a figure from the Times story to incite anger against Nelson’s tax break without telling the entire story. We rate this claim Mostly False.

We have a great opportunity to win in November. It's important that we put a candidate up that can win in November." (Q: So are you ruling out that you will file as an Independent by the April 30th deadline?) "That's right. That's right. I'm running as a Republican." - Gov. Charlie Crist, March 28, 2010 Says he has decided to run for the U.S. Senate as "a candidate without party affiliation." - Gov. Charlie Crist, April 29, 2010 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gov. Charlie Crist's announcement on April 29, 2010 that he'll bolt the Republican Party and run for the U.S. Senate as an independent would have been an unimaginable proposition just a few months ago. After all, Crist was considered a 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate and a potential rising star. Ten months ago, Crist led former House Speaker Marco Rubio by more than 30 percentage points in Senate primary polls. And just one month ago, Crist categorically dismissed the possibility he'd run for the Senate as anything other than a Republican. In a March 28 televised debate on Fox News Sunday, he told moderator Chris Wallace he would run as a Republican in the primary. Here's the exchange: WALLACE: There have been persistent rumors in Florida that you are so far behind, at least currently, in the polls — double digits to Mr. Rubio — that you may run instead as an independent. Here is your chance to dispel all the rumors. Are you willing to pledge right here, right now that you will run in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate and not run as an independent? CRIST: I'm running as a Republican. I'm very proud to be from the party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, others that really have stood up for our party, like Ronald Reagan. This is a great party. It has a great future. We have a great opportunity to win in November. It's important that we put a candidate up that can win in November. WALLACE: So are you ruling out that you will file as an Independent by the April 30th deadline? CRIST: That's right. That's right. I'm running as a Republican. Crist campaign manager Eric Eikenberg also tried to stop the run-as-an-independent talk in a April 8 press release. "To put these rumors to rest once and for all, as we have said countless times before, Governor Crist is running for the United States Senate as a Republican," Eikenberg said. "He will not run as an Independent or as a No Party Affiliation. "This should completely and utterly put to rest any of the unfounded rumors coming from the Rubio campaign that Governor Crist would run as anything other than the Republican that he is." Well, maybe they weren't so unfounded. On April 19, 2010, Crist told newspaper reporters that he was considering running as an independent. Then at a April 29 rally in his hometown of St. Petersburg, he made it official. He said he was seeking the Senate seat as "a candidate without party affiliation." At a rally in St. Petersburg, Crist said, "I believe in democracy and that people have the right to choose -- always. Now I could have chosen to stay in the primary. But frankly for me, it's your decision. It's not one club's decision or another -- or even a club within that club. It is a decision too important -- it is a decision for all the people in Florida to be able to make. So that's why we go straight to November. We give you the chance to make that decision." We previously have tracked Crist's waffling on running as a Republican or an independent, and rated his differing comments as a Half Flip on our Flip-O-Meter. His decision to run as a no party candidate turns the flip into a Full Flop.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-04-29T18:17:49	2010-04-29	['None']

pomt-09730	"Democrats rang up a $1.42 trillion budget deficit in 2009 — the single largest in American history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/22/freedom-project/freedom-project-claims-deficit-biggest-history-and/	On Oct. 16, 2009, the Treasury Department confirmed what we all expected: The deficit is big — about $1.42 trillion big. It didn't take long for Republicans to use that massive number to criticize Democrats. "Last week, the U.S. Treasury announced that Washington Democrats rang up a $1.42 trillion budget deficit in 2009 — the single largest in American history," said an Oct. 19, 2009, message from the Freedom Project, a Republican political action committee led by House Republican Leader John Boehner. "But that isn't slowing their push for more government spending, a jobs-killing national energy tax, and a costly government takeover of health care." We were curious about the first two parts of the Freedom Project's statement: that Democrats are responsible and that the deficit was the largest in history. It's important to note the months included in that deficit. In Washington, number-crunchers think in terms of fiscal years, which begin on Oct. 1 and end on Sept. 30. So when officials talk about the deficit for 2009, it is based on the budget year from October 2008 through September 2009. The spending for that year was largely determined before President Barack Obama took office by a Congress controlled by Democrats and a Republican president, George W. Bush. It's also important to understand the difference between the national deficit and the national debt. The former refers to how much money the government spends against revenues in a year, while the latter is the cumulative amount the government owes. So, the Treasury Department is estimating the 2009 deficit is $1.42 trillion while the total national debt tops out at approximately $11 trillion. Whether 2009 marks the largest deficit we've ever had depends on how you look at the numbers, said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "In nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars, $1.42 trillion is by far the largest budget deficit in history," he said. "But if you measure it by gross domestic product, it's not." Indeed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that this year's national deficit will top out at about 11.2 percent of GDP. But that would be the second highest since World War II because the deficit hit 30 percent of GDP in 1943. Still, the 2009 number is high. To put it in perspective, the deficit was only 3.2 percent of GDP in 2008, or about $459 billion. Economists prefer using the GDP number for comparisons because it accounts for inflation and other changes in the economy, Riedl said. Today's deficit of "$1.4 trillion isn't comparable to what it was back then," Riedl said. "Income was lower, prices were lower." Figuring out who's responsible for all this spending is trickier. According to the CBO, spending increased by 24 percent from fiscal year 2008 to 2009 — the largest increase since 1952. Much of that increase is the result of big-ticket items enacted in 2008, including $133 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and $291 billion for bailing out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Obama administration tacked on an additional $115 billion in stimulus spending in 2009. Other big spending items include a bill to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. On top of that, tax revenue is down about $400 billion, because individual income and corporate profits have dropped due to the economic downturn. To calculate how much responsibility Democrats had, we examined the votes for the big-ticket items. • The Omnibus. Congress did not complete work on nine of the 13 appropriations bills before Obama was elected, so the work was delayed until he took office and the bills were bundled together into what's known as an omnibus spending bill. Congress passed the $410 billion package with support from 16 Republicans in the House. The Senate approved the measure by voice vote, so there's no way to know how many Republicans supported it. • The TARP . President Bush asked for the TARP funding, and in both chambers, Republicans voted for the measure (91 House Republicans and 34 Senate Republicans, to be exact). • The economic stimulus bill. It passed with very little GOP support; no House Republicans voted for it, and only three Senate Republicans did. • War funding . It passed in June 2009 with only five GOP votes in the House and 36 in the Senate. We should mention that today's deficit is also the result of policies put in place under the Bush administration such as tax cuts, the war in Iraq and new Medicare prescription drug coverage. Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, discussed the predicament in a June 9, 2009, New York Times article about whom to blame for the deficit: "Bush behaved incredibly irresponsibly for eight years," he said. "On the one hand, it might seem unfair for people to blame Obama for not fixing it. On the other hand, he’s not fixing it." That brings us back to the Freedom Project's claim. By one standard — total dollars — the group is right that fiscal year 2009 will have the largest deficit in history. But it comes up second if you measure it by share of GDP, as many economists prefer. As for the second part, it's not correct to blame all the spending on Democrats. Yes, the Obama administration and the Democratic-led Congress are responsible for a good chunk of that spending — but many elements were backed by lots of Republicans, including President Bush. The Freedom Project glosses over this important detail, so we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-10823	"Sixty-one percent of our active military are currently listed as overweight."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/19/mike-huckabee/putting-a-little-too-much-weight-in-bmi/	Huckabee brings a rare authority to this issue. As governor of Arkansas, the ordained minister lost 110 pounds and spent lots of time talking about his experience. So when he says 61 percent of our active-duty personnel are overweight, we expect him to have done the homework. And, indeed, he has. He relies on the Defense Department's 2005 Survey of Health Related Behaviors, which was released in December 2006. It found that 60.5 percent of active-duty personnel are overweight, and that 12.9 percent are obese. But the report's statistics come with a bulging asterisk that prevents us from finding this claim to be completely true: The report arrives at the stats by looking at body-imass index, or BMI, which by itself isn't a perfect indicator of obesity. BMI is a ratio of height to weight, specifically weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of height (in meters). The 60 percent is against a standard derived from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines, which define a BMI over 25 as overweight and over 30 as obese. But using BMI alone doesn't give a full picture of a person's health and fitness level, experts say, because it doesn't distinguish between fat and muscle. Here's an example: At 6-3 and 220 pounds, Chris Brown — the NFL's leading rusher in Week 1 of the 2007 season — has a BMI of 27.5, which on the scale used to evaluate military personnel would be considered overweight and headed toward obese. Indeed, the NFL disputed a 2005 study that found nearly all of its players were overweight and more than half obese according to BMI. In fact, the Defense Department report acknowledges this flaw: "The military services (with the exception of the Air Force) use BMI as a screening measure only. Active-duty service members whose BMI exceed standards for their branch of service are subsequently measured to calculate percent body fat. Adverse career actions and enrollment into service weight management programs are based on body fat percent rather than on BMI." The report does not say how much of the military is overweight according to body fat criteria. The Military Health System does not keep individual body fat statistics, though each service monitors individual weight and fitness levels, according to Lynn Pahland, the Defense Department's director of health promotion and preventive services policy. So we can't fault Huckabee too much for using the military's publicized weight statistics, but we have to point out that those numbers don't tell the whole story.

pomt-14863	North Korea "has over two-dozen nuclear warheads."	half-true	/iowa/statements/2015/nov/14/marco-rubio/rubio-north-korea-has-over-two-dozen-nukes/	Editor's note: An earlier version of this fact-check quoted Rubio as saying North Korea had "over 2,000 nuclear warheads." Rubio's campaign did not challenge that quote during the reporting of this fact-check. Shortly after the fact-check published, a Rubio spokesman said Rubio said North Korea possessed "over two-dozen nuclear warheads." As such, we have updated this fact-check and changed the rating to Half True. In a "happy hour" meet-and-greet at Bev’s on the River in Sioux City, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio rattled off a litany of international threats facing the United States. Topping that list was North Korea’s nuclear weapons stockpile and the reclusive communist country’s potential for launching a nuclear missile at the United States. "And then you look abroad, and you see a world that’s increasingly dangerous. You have a lunatic in North Korea," Rubio said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. "A lunatic. Except he has over two-dozen nuclear warheads. And a long-range missile that can already reach the United States with that warhead on it." So, the statement to be evaluated is: Does North Korea really have more than two-dozen nuclear weapons? The short answer is no, not quite. Numerous credible arms and security organizations estimate North Korea’s nuclear arsenal at six to 16 nuclear weapons. Even at the high side of those estimates, Rubio is overestimating the North Korean nuclear threat by about 50 percent. When asked for sources supporting Rubio's claim, his campaign provided a link to a story echoing that 16-warhead estimate but also noting a Chinese estimate of up to 20. A wide consensus exists that North Korea has the capability to construct up to eight plutonium-fueled nuclear weapons. This view is shared by think tanks including the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the Arms Control Association and the Stockholm International Peace and Research Institute. Similarly, a 2013 report from the Congressional Research Service estimated that North Korea has enough plutonium for "at least a half dozen" weapons and the capability to produce another single "bomb’s worth of plutonium per year." Additionally, a report from the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies agrees with the estimate of eight plutonium bombs and adds that North Korea may also have enough uranium for four to eight more nuclear bombs. The Johns Hopkins paper goes on to project the potential growth of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. In its most aggressive prediction, the paper suggests the country could have 100 weapons by 2020. Rubio also claimed that North Korea has long-range missiles capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to American shores. He's on firm ground there. Admiral Bill Gortney, commander of U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command told a Washington think tank last month that North Korea has the ability to miniaturize its nuclear weapons and place them on a missile that could reach the United States. That view is also reflected in the Johns Hopkins report and elsewhere. There are some caveats, though. According to another Johns Hopkins report, one intercontinental ballistic missile in North Korea’s arsenal, the Taepodong-2, is a "militarized version" of a rocket designed to launch satellites into space. It is believed to have a range that would allow it to reach Alaska, but not the continental United States. Three of the Taepodong-2’s four known test launches ended in failure. The re-entry vehicle necessary for deploying a nuclear weapon from the missile, moreover, is crude, inaccurate and has never been tested, according to the Johns Hopkins report. Gortney, the NORAD commander, referred to another missile, the KN-08, which is believed to be capable of reaching targets on the West Coast of the United States. But it hasn't been flight tested and, like the Taepodong-2, is probably not accurate enough to reliably hit a target. Our ruling Rubio claimed that North Korea "has over two-dozen nuclear warheads." That overstates North Korea’s estimated nuclear arsenal by about 50 percent, but isn’t egregious given the relatively small numbers involved. (The U.S., by contrast, has more than 7,000 nukes.) We rate Rubio’s claim Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-11-14T00:14:51	2015-10-30	['None']
pomt-12177	As written, the (Illinois school funding) bill includes a bailout of Chicago’s broken teacher pension system.	false	/illinois/statements/2017/aug/01/bruce-rauner/rauners-chicago-schools-bailout-claim-rooted-polit/	The sequel to Illinois’ historic budget standoff is rapidly coming to a head in Springfield, with millions of schoolchildren caught in the middle of poisonous relations between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Chicago Democrats. The dispute, at the center of a new special legislative session called by Rauner, holds the potential to block billions of dollars of state funding for elementary and secondary schools across Illinois just before a new school year is set to begin. At issue is a catch built into the state budget that became law on July 6 over Rauner’s objections. It says that no school funding can be issued anywhere unless a separate measure containing an "evidence based" funding model, such as that contained in Senate Bill 1 (SB1), also becomes law that overhauls the formula for distributing general state aid to give a bigger share to districts with more low-income students. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com SB1 passed the General Assembly in May with almost exclusively Democratic votes but was in parliamentary limbo until July 31 when it landed on Rauner’s desk and he mulled carrying through on a threat to use his amendatory veto power to strike tens of millions of dollars for the financially beleaguered Chicago Public Schools. (Update: The next day, August 1, Rauner carried through on his amendatory veto threat.) Rauner telegraphed his action in a July 20 press release. "As written, the bill includes a bailout of Chicago’s broken teacher pension system," Rauner said,arguing that the measure rewarded Chicago at the expense of suburban and Downstate districts. Democrats beg to differ. As the numbers fly and hyperbole grows, we decided to take a closer look at Rauner’s "bailout" claim. Dysfunctional funding Believe it or not, there is one thing on which Illinois politicians of all stripes have agreed for years: The state’s system for funding public schools largely through local property taxes is woefully unfair. While low-income districts scramble to provide classroom basics, more affluent districts can afford to create some of the finest educational facilities and programs in the nation. A 2015 report by The Education Trust put it starkly: In Ohio, the highest poverty districts receive 22 percent more in state and local funds per student than the lowest poverty districts; in Illinois, the poorest districts receive 20 percent less. To address this inequity, Rauner last year formed the bipartisan Illinois School Funding Reform Commission. In February, it issued a report recommending an "evidence-based" formula in which financial and academic need would become the main determinant of how state education dollars are distributed. The formula should be applied so that no school district loses funding, the report also said, a goal only met with an increase in overall state school spending. That led to SB1, which won passage with only a single Republican vote in the House and none in the Senate. No school district gets less state money under the bill, but many low-income districts get more. With low-income students accounting for 80.2 percent of its enrollment, CPS is among the latter group. "Bailout" basics While dismissing SB1 as a Chicago "bailout," Rauner hasn’t said how he wants to change it. Nor has he addressed the inconsistency in arguing that the Chicago pension system is undeserving of state help because it is "broken" when it is still in healthier financial shape than the state-run pension system for all other teachers in Illinois. The governor is clearly irked that SB1 includes $221 million in state funding to help CPS cover the employer share of pension contributions for Chicago teachers. The provision is designed to remedy an historical quirk in which the state subsidized the costs of teacher pensions for every school district in Illinois except Chicago. Mayor Rahm Emanuel complained the arrangement meant Chicago taxpayers were double-taxed, first to pay for teacher pensions in the city and then to contribute to the cost of teacher pensions everywhere else in Illinois. The Chicago based Center for Tax and Budget Accountability estimates that in fiscal year 2016, about $230 million in individual income taxes collected in Chicago were used for suburban and downstate teacher pension payments. In a July 25 interview with WHBF Channel 4 in the Quad Cities, Rauner said he objected to SB 1 because it gave Chicago pension relief while also letting it keep other current funding. "It’s unfair to Illinois taxpayers and to our kids that they get both. They can either choose a block grant or the pension but they can’t do both," Rauner said. School districts in Illinois get state funding through two channels. "General" state aid is distributed based on a formula that factors in each district’s property tax resources. They also get funding through "mandated categoricals," which are per pupil grants for specific purposes including special education, transportation and free lunch programs for low income students. CPS receives its categorical funding in a "block grant" that is determined using a formula developed in 1995 when the district had many more students than it does today. The block grant was created to ease administrative red tape for CPS, but declining enrollment means it also has led to a windfall for city schools. The most recent report from the Illinois State Board of Education showed that CPS received $478 million in categorical funding in the 2015-2016 school year but would have received only $226 million under the system imposed on other districts. Even so, Stand for Children, an education reform group that became active in Illinois six years ago at then private citizen Rauner’s urging, sees as flawed the governor’s claim that the SB1 financing package is skewed to favor Chicago. Rauner’s own reform commission recommended that any new funding formula ensure no district get less this year than last, Stand for Children points out. As for the state pension pickup, the group says SB 1 only puts CPS on equal footing with the rest of the state. Bye-bye block grant Rauner’s complaint about Chicago’s block grant constituting a bailout ignores one of the most important aspects of SB 1: After the first year -- in which no district would receive less funding -- Chicago’s special block grant goes away. CPS is then required to abide by the same formula for calculating the size of categorical grants imposed on other districts. "The main principle going into this ‘evidence-based model’ conversation that everyone acknowledged was we can’t take money from districts, we can’t pit districts against each other, we can’t create winners and losers," said Jessica Handy, government affairs director for Stand for Children Illinois. "With block grant funding, you can’t say, ‘No district loses except we don’t like this thing so we’ll take it away from Chicago.’" In another analysis of SB 1, the liberal-leaning Center for Tax and Budget Accountability said cutting the current block grant for CPS would undercut the very purpose of the governor’s commission. "Not cutting funding CPS already receives is rational -- given that CPS’s current level of funding is some $2.1 billion less than what the evidence shows is needed to educate its students," a CTBA report concluded. "The goal after all is to move all districts forward towards adequacy." Both Stand for Children and the CTBA cite another statistic to bolster their argument that SB 1 is fair: CPS educates roughly 20 percent of the state’s children and figures to be in line for roughly 20 percent of all new school funding if the bill’s evidence-based formula kicks in. It’s also worth noting that Rauner has for more than a year been open to the idea of sending pension relief to CPS in exchange for other pension reforms. He vetoed a bill that would have given CPS $215 million for pensions in December, not because he opposed the idea but because he said Democrats reneged on a deal that tied CPS pension relief to approval of a broader pension reform plan for all state workers. Some, but not all, of Rauner’s pension wish list was included by majority Democrats in the $36 billion state budget they enacted on July 6 over the governor’s veto. Our ruling Attempting to parse a political buzzword like "bailout" might be impossible if not for the clear direction provided by Rauner’s own Illinois Education Funding Reform Commission. It called for an "evidence-based" school funding formula but also recommended a "hold harmless" provision that would ensure no district received less this year than last. By that dictate alone, CPS should not be in line this year for a cut in the size of its block grant. What’s more, SB1 does do away with the CPS block grant starting with the 2018-19 school year, poking a major hole in Rauner’s "bailout" claim. The bill’s Chicago pension component can’t be called a "bailout" or even a perk because it only gives CPS what every other school district already has. And Rauner clearly had sought previously to bargain CPS pension help for other, statewide pension reforms. He got a major one in the budget lawmakers enacted July 6. Numbers are sure to fly fast and furious as Rauner and lawmakers duke this out in Springfield in the days ahead, but we find Rauner’s generalization that SB 1 is a "bailout" for Chicago schools to be False.

pomt-09046	"I have spent virtually every weekend since Memorial Day in the Panhandle."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/02/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-camps-out-floridas-emerald-coast/	Charlie Crist and pop icon Jimmy Buffett shoulder to shoulder before a crowd of Parrotheads at Pensacola Beach. Charlie Crist, hands on hips, standing next to President Barack Obama in view of another sugar-sand coast. Charlie Crist, bent low, inspecting just washed-up oil gook with a stick. Charlie Crist, barefoot and in shorts, holding hands with a chain of anti-drilling protesters near the shore. For Floridians, images of the governor's furrowed brow and tawny, beach-ready complexion have become as much of a symbol of the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster as BP's ubiquitous underwater video footage. The media frenzy makes Twilight heartthrob Robert Pattinson look underexposed in comparison, growl critics, who paint Crist as an opportunist more interested in having his picture taken than helping the fishermen, hoteliers, boaters and restaurateurs who are losing customers because of the gushing oil. Future Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Melbourne, complained Crist was doing more harm than good. "It drives tourists away," he said. "It looks like Florida is having the same problem as Louisiana." We could check whether Louisiana's problems of oil on the beach, fishermen out of work, and coastal businesses hurting are different than Florida's, but Haridopolos isn't our subject today. Besides, Crist counters that his motivations are purely altruistic. "My first duty is to do my job and I'm going to do it," he told the St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald Tallahassee Bureau. But, that doesn't mean Crist, a former Republican running as an independent for the U.S. Senate, is above pointing out just how much time he has devoted to the oil crisis in recent weeks. "I have become sort of a pseudo resident of the Panhandle lately and am enjoying it very much," he told a crowd of government leaders at a Florida Association of Counties conference in Tampa on July 1, 2010. "I've been in Escambia, Santa Rosa, Wakulla and Apalachicola, got some oysters out of the bay there, and I will tell you some of the most resilient people in this state reside there." Minutes later he added, "I have spent virtually every weekend since Memorial Day in the Panhandle." To be sure, Crist landed in the Emerald Coast long before that patriotic holiday announcing summer's unofficial beginning. He held his first press conference on the coast on May 1 and went back three more times the next week. He returned the following weekend, meeting with Apalachicola fishermen and Destin hospitality leaders. But, Crist's statement zereod in on his post-Memorial Day activities, so we did, too. An official calender kept by the Executive Office of the Governor quickly revealed Crist had spent every weekend since Memorial Day on the Emerald Coast, and many, many more days in between. Turns out, in this instance "virtually," meant "literally." The fun started on Saturday, June 5, when Crist joined Buffett on a hunt for signs of tar at Pensacola Beach. The following weekend Crist called for green energy in a CBS News Face the Nation interview from Panama City on Sunday, June 13. A week later, he toured the boom staging area in Port St. Joe both by foot and by sea on Sunday, June 20. The next weekend was especially busy. Crist opted to stay overnight in Pensacola starting Friday, June 25. He began with a briefing on the shoreline cleanup at Pensacola Beach Pier, followed by a tour of Pensacola Bay Friday afternoon. On Saturday, Crist attended a 6 a.m. communications briefing in Pensacola, then stopped by the Santa Rosa Yacht & Boat Club for a briefing with Mike Sole, the state's Department of Environmental Protection Secretary. Sole and Crist toured the gulf on the Orion, a Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission patrol vessel, then sat through another briefing at the Pensacola Beach Gulf Pier. Crist's last stop was at a Hands Across the Sand demonstration at Pensacola Beach's Navarre Pier, where he joined hands with anti-drilling protesters. On Sunday, Crist could be found surveying Pensacola Beach Gulf Pier. He then hopped on a plane with Major General Emmett "Buddy" Titshaw of the Florida National Guard to get an aerial view. The weekend ran long. Crist and Sole met in Pensacola again on Monday before Crist returned home for the night. But Crist returned to Pensacola the next day for an incident briefing. He then held a media availability at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. And that's not all. Crist also made sure to stop by and shake hands with the natives during multiple weekday visits. He held a press conference on the spill from the Tallahassee Emergency Operations Center on Wednesday, June 2, before arriving in Pensacola for a coastline fly-over at noon. The next day, after a quick jaunt back to Tallahassee, Crist overlooked Pensacola's beaches from a plane alongside Attorney General Bill McCollum. He then made his way to the Escambia County Emergency Operations Center for a briefing. That might be enough to satisify someone else, but Crist's appetite for the oil disaster persisted, so he continued on to another briefing, this time at the Santa Rosa County Emergency Operations Center. The following week, he attended a 5 a.m. and a noon communications briefing at Pensacola Beach, Friday, June 11. Then there was the photo opportunity that outshined all other photo opportunities. Crist chatted oil with President Barack Obama at Pensacola Beach on June 15. Days later, Crist met with Phillippe Cousteau, grandson of the oceanographer icon Jacques Cousteau, in Pensacola on Wednesday, June 23. He then shook hands with U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Robert Papp at the Pensacola Regional Airport, before taking an aerial inspection of the gulf coast shoreline. Crist followed his plane ride with a walking tour of the beach. We think it is also worthwhile to note that even on the days when he stayed away from the Emerald Coast, his schedule remained peppered with spill-related meetings and events. Friday, June 4, was a big day for Crist, who started the morning with interviews with Good Morning America, CNN's American Morning and CBS' The Early Show. He then made his way to the Big Easy to listen to Obama promise results at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. He got more television time on Sunday, June 6, when he gave interviews from Tallahassee to Candy Crowley of CNN's State of the Union, and Fox News' Geraldo Rivera. Crist returned to Pinellas County, his hometown area, Monday, June 7, for a meeting with fishing and tourism leaders first in Madeira Beach, then St. Petersburg Beach. He then stopped for lunch at Leverock's Seafood House in St. Petersburg to promote Florida seafood. On Wednesday, June 9, Crist's day started with a call to the White House from Tallahassee and ended with a visit to the Deepwater Horizon command post in Miami. He headed south again to meet Miami Beach tourism leaders worried about the spill on Monday, June 14. Crist was in Tallahassee on Wednesday, June 16, when he began his day with a call from the White House for a review of the oil response. He squeezed in a Deepwater Horizon briefing at the Tallahassee Emergency Operations Center on Monday, June 21. Most recently, he met Obama's BP claims czar at Tampa International Airport to discuss the emerging payout process on Thursday, July 1. Crist's zigzagging travels are hard to add up. But we think that's at least 10 news conferences, 19 briefings, 8 beach tours, 4 aerial tours, 5 national networks, and gobs of quality time with Buffett, Obama, Cousteau and Geraldo -- all since Memorial Day. To break it down another way, Crist's Panhandle visits come to six weekend days and eight weekdays. He spent another eight days on oil-related meetings and events. That's more days than many people get to spend with their mother each year. In times like this, we wish the Truth-O-Meter had a "Duh" option in its ruling categories, but we will just settle for True.

pomt-14937	On receiving campaign contributions from out-of-state donors	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/28/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-changes-his-tune-campaign-contributi/	More than 20 years ago, when he was first running for U.S. Senate, Democrat Russ Feingold painted a list of promises on the garage door of his Middleton home. Those 1992 vows -- he called it a contract with Wisconsin voters -- formed the basis of Feingold’s unusual "everyman" campaign. They were highlighted in memorable TV ads created by the late Steve Eichenbaum. Among the promises: Feingold said he would "rely on Wisconsin citizens for most of my contributions." That grassroots approach helped him win the Senate seat three times. But in 2010, Feingold was ousted by Republican businessman Ron Johnson, who spent millions of his own money on the race. In May 2015, Feingold announced that he would challenge Johnson in 2016. Six weeks later, Feingold filed his first campaign finance report with the Federal Election Commission. It showed he had already raised about $2.3 million. The National Journal reported Aug. 13, 2015 that it had examined Feingold’s individual contributions and determined the majority of the money had come from out of state. Times change. And so do positions. Cue the Flip-O-Meter, which examines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Remember: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent. The more-than-half-from-Wisconsin pledge is not a 1992 campaign relic. Feingold followed it in his re-election bids in 1998, 2004 and in 2010. This time around it was clear early on that Feingold planned to run a different kind of campaign. In an Aug. 13, 2015 interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Feingold noted that the campaign finance rules were different now than when he first ran for federal office. The McCain-Feingold campaign finance rules that he famously championed have been undone by the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens’ United decision, which unleashed virtually unlimited campaign contributions to outside groups. Feingold said he will not operate in this campaign by the pledge he made in past races. "It makes no sense now," he said. Feingold argues the pledge was made on an election-to-election basis. "Every single election is different based on the reality of the campaign finance law at the time," he said. "What I did in the past is to offer a pledge or a series of proposals for a six-year term." Maybe so, but that does not affect us here. We’re rating the consistency of a position, not whether a promise had been broken. Our rating In four Senate campaigns, Feingold abided by the pledge he inscribed on his garage door: He would raise the majority of his campaign cash from Wisconsin residents. Feingold said he was changing with the times, and is no longer bound by his previous pledge. That’s a complete reversal. And a Full Flop.

pomt-14373	"Every (U.S. Supreme Court) nominee since 1875 has received a nomination hearing."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/mar/20/mark-herring/herring-says-all-supreme-court-nominees-back-1875-/	Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring recently joined an effort to convince U.S. Senate leaders this year to fill the U.S. Supreme Court seat opened by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. President Barack Obama on March 16 nominated U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland for the seat. This follows weeks of vows by Senate Republicans not to hold confirmation hearings for any Obama nominee and their insistence that filling the high court seat be left to the new president in January. Herring signed a March 10 letter with the Democratic attorneys general of 17 other states - plus those of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico - telling Senate leaders from both parties they have a constitutional responsibility to act on Obama’s nominee. They said the refusal of Senate Republicans to consider a nominee this year breaks long tradition and that "every nominee since 1875 has received a confirmation hearing." We wondered whether that statement spanning the past 141 years is correct. Michael Kelly, director of communications for Herring, said the claim is based on information from the White House website, which says "since 1875, every nominee has received a hearing or a vote." That wording is a bit different than the claim in the attorneys general letter, that every nominee since the mid-1870s received a "confirmation hearing." We spoke with four experts on Supreme Court history, and they all took issue with the statement in the letter. The first confirmation hearing wasn’t held until 1873, according to a 2016 article published by Paul Collins Jr., a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, and Lori Ringhand, a professor and associate dean at the University of Georgia School of Law. But that was a closed-door session probing a narrow issue of whether chief justice nominee George Williams misused Department of Justice funds for personal expenses, the professors wrote. For the next 40 years, the Judiciary Committee discussed and voted on three dozen potential justices without hearing testimony from the nominees or anybody else, according to a 2009 Congressional Research Service report. And unlike today, those sessions were held behind closed doors. The Judiciary Committee didn’t hold its first public hearing on a Supreme Court nominee until 1916. The nominee and future justice, Louis Brandeis, wasn’t required to show up, and he didn’t. When it comes to an open forum in which a nominee testifies before the committee - the way it’s done today - that didn’t happen until 1925. That year, Harlan Stone became the first nominee to testify publicly before the Judiciary Committee. He was called to address concerns by some senators about his financial connections. Stone handled the questions with aplomb and served 21 years on the court - the last five as chief justice. For the next 30 years, the committee usually, but not always, held public hearings. There was no custom of having the nominee appear before the panel, according to Henry Abraham, a retired University of Virginia government professor who wrote the book "Justices and Presidents: A Political History of Appointments to the Supreme Court." That changed after the confirmation of Chief Justice Earl Warren, a three-term Republican governor of California, in March 1954. Two months later, the high court unanimously handed down the Brown v. Board of Education decision that required the integration of public schools. Outraged Southern senators resolved that future nominees would not be given an easy confirmation path, according to Abraham and several other Supreme Court experts we contacted. The next nominee was John Harlan II, a Republican from New York who Southern Democrats denounced as an "ultra-liberal" dedicated to eroding the Constitution by "judicial fiat." In February 1955, the Judiciary Committee held two days of closed-door hearings on the nomination and then opened the proceeding to the public for Harlan’s testimony. A month later, the Senate confirmed Harlan on a 71-11 vote. Thus was born what experts say is the modern tradition of the committee holding a public hearing that includes testimony by the nominee. There have been two footnote exceptions since 1955, according to a 2009 study by the Congressional Research Service: In June 2005, President George W. Bush nominated John Roberts to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. The nomination was withdrawn without a public hearing that September, when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died. Bush then nominated Roberts to be chief justice and, after public hearings, he was confirmed. In October 2005, Bush nominated Harriet Miers for O’Connor’s seat. Miers, a close adviser to Bush, was criticized heavily for not having judicial experience. Several weeks later, Bush withdrew her nomination before a public hearing was held. Our ruling Herring and fellow attorneys general wrote that "every (U.S. Supreme Court) nominee since 1875 has received a confirmation hearing." The claim hits a recent roadblock with the 2005 nominations of Roberts and Miers, although we note their names were withdrawn before a formal hearing could be held. But going even further back, from the 1870s to mid-1910s, there’s no record of three dozen Supreme Court prospects getting any formal hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Instead, the panel met behind closed doors to discuss and vote on nominees. In the context of modern-day nomination hearings, which nowadays entail dissecting a potential high court jurist’s background and qualifications in formal appearances in public, that process didn’t start in earnest until the 1950s. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Mark Herring	None	None	None	2016-03-20T00:00:00	2016-03-10	['None']

pomt-13968	"Hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/14/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-anti-muslim-hate-crimes-tripl/	During her speech after an ISIS-inspired attack on an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Hillary Clinton pledged to fight terrorism but also cautioned Americans not to see the vast majority of Muslims as enemies. "It's no coincidence that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino," she said during her June 13, 2016, speech. Is she correct that attacks have tripled? We located calculations published in December 2015 by Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino, that generally support Clinton's assertion, and her campaign confirmed that Levin’s data was their source. According to the FBI, a hate crime is defined as "criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against" a particular group such as a religion, race or sexual orientation. In all, 45 states and the federal government have a hate crime statute, but the FBI hate-crime data also includes crimes committed in states without an official hate-crime law. However, the reporting of crimes to the FBI is more spotty, because reporting by local jurisdictions is voluntary. A 2012 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that there were 293,800 hate crimes annually across the country, with 60 percent of them not reported to police. In recent years, anti-Muslim incidents have ranked second to anti-Jewish incidents among all anti-religious hate crimes since 9/11, Levin added. As for the spike Clinton referred to, Levin calculated that the number of reported anti-Islamic hate crimes during a five-year period before the Paris and San Bernardino attacks was 12.6 per month. However, in the month-long period between Nov. 13 to Dec. 13, 2015 -- after the Paris attacks and in a period that included the San Bernardino attacks -- there were at least 37 suspected hate crimes. "The 37 suspected hate crime cases are 2.94 times the average calendar monthly number seen from 2010-14," Levin wrote. That’s very close to "triple," as Clinton put it. He added that "this appears to be the highest monthly total since 2001, when there were 481 anti-Muslim hate crimes reported for the year, with most taking place after 9/11." Levin told PolitiFact that such spikes are not a new phenomenon, citing incidents after racially charged events in the 1980s in the New York City neighborhoods of Howard Beach and Bensonhurst, and after the riots that followed the beating of black motorist Rodney King in the early 1990s in Los Angeles. "There is often a significant spike following a catalytic event," Levin said. We will make one caveat about Clinton’s comment. It’s possible to read her phrasing -- that such incidents "have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino" -- to mean that these incidents tripled and then remained at that elevated level. But the data in Levin’s study doesn’t include the months so far in 2016, so it’s impossible to know that for sure. Levin did say that history shows that after a spike, the level may drop, but not to the level prior to the spike. For instance, after the 9/11 attacks, the number of reported hate crimes against Muslims did eventually decline, but not to the pre-9/11 level. Our ruling Clinton said that "hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques have tripled after Paris and San Bernardino." Calculations by the director of an academic center found that the number did triple after those attacks. But it’s worth noting that his data does not show whether or not they remained at that elevated level, or for how long -- something that would be a reasonable interpretation of what Clinton said. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c6f5f6b3-c3f6-4754-908e-e00c0d8cfef5	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-06-14T13:37:23	2016-06-13	['San_Bernardino,_California']

pomt-14127	On supporting the eventual Republican presidential nominee	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/06/paul-ryan/vexed-donald-trump-has-paul-ryan-changed-his-posit/	On May 3, 2016, Donald Trump earned the title of presumptive Republican presidential nominee by winning decisively in Indiana’s GOP primary election. Ted Cruz, who is second in delegates behind Trump, dropped out of the race the same night. And John Kasich, the final remaining contender, ended his campaign the next day. But less than 48 hours after Hoosiers gave Trump his climactic victory (for which he gives ex-basketball coach Bobby Knight big credit), House Speaker Paul Ryan made huge headlines by saying he is not ready to support Trump for president. Previously, the Wisconsin Republican has said he will support the GOP nominee. So, has Ryan -- the chairman of the convention and the highest-ranking member of his party to explicitly withhold his support from Trump -- flip-flopped? Let’s pivot to our Flip-O-Meter, which determines whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Past statements Here are some of the statements Ryan has made in recent weeks: Jan. 13, 2016: Today Show host Matt Lauer asked, referring to Trump: "If he becomes the nominee of the party, will you support him? Ryan replied: "Yes, I will. I'll support whoever our nominee is." March 1, 2016: At his weekly news conference with reporters, Ryan criticized Trump for equivocating about receiving support from white supremacists, but said: "I plan to support the nominee. I think I’ve said enough this morning about what’s happening right now. My plan is to support the nominee." March 15, 2016: Asked at a news conference at the Republican National Committee's headquarters whether whether he would support the eventual nominee, whoever it may be, Ryan said he would, adding: "My position hasn’t changed on that." Post-presumptive statements Compare those to what Ryan said to CNN host Jake Tapper on May 5, 2016: Tapper: So, Mr. Speaker, you have said throughout this process that you will support the Republican presidential nominee. Now you have a presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. Will you support him? Ryan: Well, to be perfectly candid with you, Jake, I’m just not ready to do that at this point. I’m not there right now. And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party. And I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee. Moments later, there was a follow-up question. Tapper: So you’re saying you can’t support or endorse him right now? Ryan: Yes, I am basically saying that ….But at this point, I think that he needs do more to unify this party to bring all wings of the Republican Party together ... Pretty clearly a partial change in position. Ryan invited Trump to meet Tuesday, May 10, with Republican House leaders, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus is expected to meet that day with Ryan and Trump, according to a statement from Ryan’s office. Our rating Ryan has said repeatedly he would support for president whomever wins the Republican nomination. He said so even when asked specifically about Trump being the nominee. But in his first comments after Trump became the presumptive nominee, Ryan wavered. He did not say he would not support Trump. But he stated he is not ready to support him at this time. It’s worth noting that the party won’t officially have a nominee until its convention in Cleveland in July 2016, although no one but Trump is in a position to claim the nomination. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b8406c30-75af-43c1-9588-614de3018d5c But for pledging to support the GOP nominee and now withholding that support, at least for the time being, we give Ryan a Half Flip.

pomt-13023	"We would be just like North Carolina with HB2-like (transgender bathroom) legislation. It actually passed our chamber and I vetoed it."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/dec/05/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-wrongly-likens-virginia-bill-north-carol/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently took credit for saving Virginia from passing a law similar to North Carolina’s HB2 act that dictates which public restrooms transgender people can use. "I’ve had to veto some very bad bills," McAuliffe said Nov. 30 during his monthly radio show on WTOP in Washington. "We would be just like North Carolina with HB2-like legislation. It actually passed our chamber and I vetoed it." Republicans, who control both houses of Virginia’s General Assembly, quickly mocked the Democratic governor’s claim. "Uh, no." the Republican Party of Virginia tweeted. "Why can't @GovernorVA simply tell the truth about this? Does he not even know what he vetoed?" So we checked whether McAuliffe’s statement is correct. It came at the end of a segment is which the governor said he thinks President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, is not an "ideologue" on social issues and wants to focus on boosting the economy. North Carolina HR2, also called the "bathroom bill," was passed by North Carolina’s General Assembly on March 23, 2016, and signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory that night. The state law has two main provisions: *It requires transgender people to use the restrooms in many public facilities that correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificate instead of the sex with which they identify. The law applies to school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers as well as the facilities in state and local government buildings. *It set a state definition of classes of people who are protected from discrimination based on their race, religion, color, national origin, age, handicap or "biological sex." Omitted from protection are transgender and gay people. The law has triggered a fierce backlash. The NBA, in protest, yanked its 2017 all-star game from Charlotte. The Atlantic Coast Conference and the NCAA pulled collegiate championship games that were scheduled to played in North Carolina this year and next. Financial service giants PayPal and Deutsche Bank froze expansion plans in North Carolina. Rock icons Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Ringo Starr canceled concerts in the state. All told, Forbes magazine estimated on Nov. 3 that the law had cost North Carolina $630 million in lost business. Now, let’s move north. Virginia Brian Coy, communications chief for McAuliffe, told us that the governor’s radio comment referred to his veto of a so-called "religious freedom" bill on March 30, 2016 - exactly one week after HB2 was signed in North Carolina. The Virginia bill would have protected ministers and religious entities from facing government-imposed penalties or civil liability for refusing to perform or host gay marriages. The sponsor - Sen. Bill Carrico Sr., R-Grayson - said it would shield many religious people from being forced to act against their beliefs. Opponents said the legislation promoted bigotry against the LGBT community. The bill passed both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly on party-line votes with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposed. McAuliffe vetoed the measure on March 30, writing that the legislation, if signed, would send a message that Virginia is "more concerned with demonizing people than with creating a strong business climate." You may have noticed that the Virginia bill, unlike the North Carolina legislation McAuliffe compared it to, didn’t mention restrooms. In fact, it had nothing to do with them. It didn’t restrict anyone’s use of bathrooms in state, local government or school buildings - let alone their use by transgender people. In substance, the bill was quite different from HB2. Coy acknowledged those distinctions to us but stressed that the two bills have broad similarities: both are discriminatory and are bad for business growth. McAuliffe "fully understands that the (Virginia) bill had different language than HB2 in North Carolina did," Coy wrote in an email. "His point is that it would have had very similar consequences in sending a message to businesses and individuals around the world that Virginia is a place where we sanction against LGBT people simply because of whom they love." The governor, we should point out, offered no such elaboration during the radio broadcast. A final note: There was a bathroom bill introduced in Virginia’s General Assembly that came pretty close to mirroring HR2. The legislation - introduced by Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania - would have required people to use the restrooms in schools and state-owned buildings that correspond to their "biological sex." The measure was killed by a House committee. Our ruling McAuliffe said, "We would be just like North Carolina with HB2-like (transgender bathroom) legislation. It actually passed our chamber and I vetoed it." The governor vetoed a bill that would have protected ministers and religious entities from facing government-imposed penalties or civil liability for refusing to perform or host gay marriages. HB2 says transgender people in North Carolina must use restrooms in schools and other government facilities that match with the sex listed on their birth certificates instead of the sex with which they identify. It raises the spectacle of government enforcing a law aimed against a tiny minority. It has provoked protests and boycotts from businesses, sports organizations and entertainers that have cost the state dearly. The two bills are comparable in that they allow discrimination against members of the LGBT community. But they are very different in substance and it’s misleading for McAuliffe to say that his veto saved Virginia from being ‘just like North Carolina with HB2-like legislation." We rate his statement Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/792f9069-5868-40d8-b517-8e3827b181b0	None	Terry McAuliffe	None	None	None	2016-12-05T11:19:45	2016-11-30	['None']
pomt-07421	"In Senate Bill 5, there is this new method of evaluating teachers. … You’re also going to be rated on what the parents think of you and they can send questionnaires and surveys home to parents."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/26/tim-grendell/state-senator-tim-grendell-says-parent-questionnai/	Ohio’s new collective bargaining law does away with the traditional pay structure for public workers that values work experience and replaces it with a system that focuses on job performance. For public school teachers, the shift means teacher evaluations would be factored into their salary. The new law, known as Senate Bill 5, has been signed by Republican Gov. John Kasich but it is not in effect yet. Organized labor groups and Democrats are trying to repeal SB 5 through a voter referendum this fall because they say the law is unfair to middle-class, working families. State Sen. Tim Grendell, a Republican from Chesterland who voted against SB 5, criticized the new structure for paying teachers during a televised forum about the state budget April 18 in Cleveland. "In Senate Bill 5, there is this new method of evaluating teachers…you’re also going to be rated on what the parents think of you and they can send questionnaires and surveys home to parents," Grendell said. Allowing parents to play a role in evaluating teachers – and ultimately deciding how much they get paid – is problematic, Grendell said, because teachers are responsible for disciplining their children. Since SB 5 continues to be a heavily debated issue and because supporters of the law have accused teachers unions of misleading their members about how the law will affect salaries, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Grendell’s claim. Within SB 5 – a massive law change that overhauls collective bargaining for public employees and establishes numerous rules regarding pay and benefits – is a section devoted to paying teachers. The law eliminates the previous structure set in law, which sets raises based on a teacher’s education level and work experience. The law says that school boards must adopt a pay structure based on a teacher’s performance. The law does not prescribe dollar amounts for salaries, but it says that districts must factor five categories into their performance-based pay schedule: what type of license the teacher holds, whether the teacher is "highly qualified" as defined by state law, students’ classroom performance, teacher performance evaluations, and any other criteria the board decides to incorporate. Grendell’s claim related to teacher evaluations, so let’s zero in on that aspect of the performance-based pay structure. SB 5 includes a description of what the teacher evaluations would look like. The law requires the State Board of Education to establish a framework for the evaluations. Local school districts then will adopt their own specific evaluations based on the state’s framework. The evaluations will include whether parents and students are satisfied with a teacher, "which may be measured by surveys, questionnaires, or other forms of soliciting feedback," the law reads. Teacher evaluations also will measure how the teacher works in the classroom, which can be gauged by classroom observations; how the teacher communicates with students, parents, colleagues and members of the community; and students’ test scores. Local school districts will have some discretion in deciding how to weight the different pieces of teacher evaluations, but they are expected to include each factor laid out under the new law. As Grendell pointed out at the budget forum, the law does call for parent questionnaires to gauge parent’s satisfaction. We rate the statement True.

pomt-11159	"Actor Brad Pitt: ‘Trump is not my president, we have no future with this…’"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/24/blog-posting/brad-pitt-donald-trump-not-my-president/	Brad Pitt has been critical of President Donald Trump, but he didn’t really say that "Trump is not my president," despite what a clickbait headline claims. "Actor Brad Pitt: ‘Trump is not my president, we have no future with this," reads the headline on conservativetown.com. The article that followed offered a mash-up of real and fake details. But the story provided no evidence that Pitt said the lines attributed to him in the headline. The blog post begins by saying the actor showed up as a meteorologist on The Jim Jefferies Show, "stating some discouraging news about President Donald Trump pulling out the United States of the Paris Climate Change Agreement." Pitt indeed made a satirical cameo as an acting meteorologist on May 1, 2018, on The Jim Jefferies Show, a stand-up comedy segment on Comedy Central. But he made no mention of Trump or the Paris climate agreement. When Jefferies asked for the weatherman’s forecast, Pitt referenced the melting ice caps. "We’ve got sunshine in the West, the South, the East, and over here in the North, the ice caps are melting," Pitt said. "And I am so, so, so, so, so scared." But on June 6, 2017, five days after Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Pitt had another cameo where he told Jefferies, "There is no future." The line was met with audience laughter and applause. We searched for articles using Google and the Nexis database that mentioned Pitt saying "Trump is not my president," but we did not find any documented examples. Pitt has made comments critical of Trump, which were wrongly attributed to his Jim Jefferies appearance on the post. In an interview with novelist Marlon James that appeared in the New York Times Style Magazine on Sept. 7, 2016, Pitt said, "Man, I never thought Brexit would happen. Same way I can’t bring myself to think that Trump will be in charge." "A Trump supporter is fighting against just about everything," Pitt said later in the interview. "What does he even mean, take our country back? Would someone please explain that to me? Where’d it go?" Our ruling A headline on Conservativetown.com said, "Actor Brad Pitt: ‘Trump Is Not My President, We Have No Future With This…’" The content of the article mostly referenced real quotes, attributed to the wrong sources. They failed to acknowledge the satirical role Pitt was playing on The Jim Jefferies Show. And while Pitt made comments critical of Trump, he never said, "Trump is not my president," as the headline claimed. We rate this statement False.

pomt-11248	Says Beto O’Rourke had a "resolution to legalize all narcotics--including heroin and other deadly opioids."	false	/texas/statements/2018/may/02/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-falsely-beto-orourke-legalize-narcotics-a/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, seeking a second term representing Texas, declared that his Democratic challenger from El Paso made a "radical" move to legalize all narcotics. The Houston Republican said in his May 1, 2018, tweet: "With opioids ravaging so many American communities, Congressman Beto O’Rourke's radical resolution to legalize all narcotics--including heroin and other deadly opioids--is looking worse and worse all the time." David Wysong of O’Rourke’s campaign brought Cruz’s claim to our attention. By email, Wysong noted that in 2012, we rated Half True a claim that O’Rourke favored legalizing drugs across the board. O’Rourke, then a member of the El Paso City Council, favored legalizing marijuana, we confirmed, but had called only for debate about legalizing narcotics. Cruz points out Daily Caller story Cruz’s tweet pointed to a May 1, 2018, story posted by the conservative Daily Caller headlined "Remember That One Time Beto O’Rourke Called for Legalizing All Narcotics." The story includes video of O’Rourke speaking at what’s evidently the Jan. 6, 2009, El Paso City Council meeting, which included adoption of a resolution urging federal action to stem violence on the Mexico side of the border. O’Rourke, seeking to amend the resolution, said at the meeting: "And I’d ask that there be some language in here that would also include advocating, or looking at, rethinking our War on Drugs, which by any measure I’ve looked it has been an abject failure. And also, looking at ending the prohibition on narcotics in the United States. And I’m not saying that we need to do that – to end the prohibition. I think we need to have a serious discussion about doing that, and that may, in the end, be the right course of action." The resolution opens by noting criminal violence playing out in neighboring Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. It also generally urges a national shift from the war on drugs to a focus on prevention and rehabilitation. The resolution, unanimously approved by the council, doesn’t state that all narcotics should be legalized. It does say that the mayor and council urge the federal government to support local law enforcement battling the illegal export of weapons to Mexico and to stiffen penalties on people who "illegally traffic chemical agents used in the manufacturing of illicit drugs." The resolution also offers support to federal, state and local agencies battling money laundering, vehicle theft, gun smuggling and other cross-border criminal activity. Specific to drugs, the resolution urges funding "greater efforts to reduce" U.S. drug consumption and support for legislation "that examines the nation’s policies on drugs with a focus on rehabilitation rather than incarceration." Also, the resolution says, the federal government should be supporting "an honest, open national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics." When we emailed Cruz’s camp asking how he concluded that O’Rourke wants to legalize all narcotics, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier provided a Jan. 6, 2009, Associated Press news story headlined "El Paso wants feds to consider legalizing drugs." That story slightly misquotes the El Paso council resolution, saying it calls for an "open, honest, national dialogue on ending the prohibition of narcotics." Next, it quotes O’Rourke saying: "We think it should at least be on the table and so far it hasn't." Our online search for that story led us to a Jan. 22, 2009, news story about El Paso in the New York Times stating that the "conflict in Juárez has led some in El Paso to propose radical solutions. In a symbolic resolution of support for Juárez, the El Paso City Council recently voted unanimously to ask Washington to consider legalizing drugs as a way to end the violence." The story then quoted O’Rourke saying that ending the prohibition should be on the table. The Times story said too that the council backed off its resolution on Jan. 13, 2009 after Mayor John Cook vetoed it and and local members of Congress warned that the council’s stance might imperil federal aid. But as noted in a May 2, 2018, Texas Tribune news story, O’Rourke later conceded that his call for open debate could have been handled better. O’Rourke wrote in his 2011 book, "Dealing Death and Drugs: The Big Business of Dope in the U.S. and Mexico," that after the resolution came to the council from a city committee on border relations, "I asked whether we should more aggressively address the issues related to demand and prohibition." O’Rourke wrote that he listened to council discussion and then offered his amendment, "composed on the spot," O’Rourke wrote, to "encourage ‘an honest, open, national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics.’" O’Rourke elaborated: "It was an artless, and even inaccurate amendment to the larger resolution (I only learned later that marijuana is not a narcotic, even though it was precisely that drug that I felt people would be most open to debating), but it got the point across. "I knew we were addressing a taboo topic, one that conventional wisdom dictated that only potheads, hard-core libertarians and political suicides ever brought up. But I also knew that Juarez had gone beyond the pale and it was time to place all options on the table, even those that had been unthinkable, for me as well as others, just a year ago." On his campaign website, O'Rourke calls for ending the federal government's war on drugs and encouraging reforms in drug control policies. He also calls for ending the "federal prohibition on marijuana." O’Rourke told residents of Sonora, Texas on April 28, 2018, that he’s among co-sponsors of legislation to decriminalize marijuana under federal law. Congressional records show O’Rourke in May 2017 signed on as a co-sponsor of an act removing marijuana from the federal controlled substances list. The act’s author, Rep. Thomas Garrett, R-Va., said in a statement that his proposal would leave it to individual states to determine appropriate medicinal uses of marijuana. Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke had a resolution to legalize all narcotics. In 2009, an El Paso City Council resolution directed at the federal government included language from O’Rourke urging open debate about ending the national prohibition of narcotics. The resolution, adopted but later vetoed, did not call for legalizing all narcotics nor did we spot evidence that O’Rourke has taken that sweeping stand. We rate Cruz’s claim False.

pomt-14957	Two years ago motorists in Ferguson, a city of 20,000 people, "received 31,000 citations. That's at least one citation per person plus 10,000 for visitors. The city is still surviving only on traffic tickets; there's virtually no industry there."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2015/oct/22/emanuel-cleaver/rep-emanuel-cleaver-uses-wrong-figure-statement-ab/	U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat who recently appeared on National Public Radio's "Up To Date" to speak about current events in Ferguson, Missouri, referred to a Department of Justice report that pointedly criticized the practices of the Ferguson Police Department as unjust and profiteering. The report, released March 4, gave the public insight into the practices of the city of Ferguson, whose police department has made raising revenue a key priority. "It's taxation by citation. Two years ago a city of 20,000 people received 31,000 citations," said Cleaver, who represents Kansas City and a portion of western Missouri. "That's at least one citation per person plus 10,000 for visitors. The city is still surviving only on traffic tickets; there's virtually no industry there." We wondered about Cleaver's claim regarding both the number of citations issued and whether "the city is still surviving only on traffic tickets; there's virtually no industry there." Ferguson citations John Jones, a spokesman for Cleaver, pointed us to the Department of Justice report to support his claim about the number of citations issued in the small city. This report is blunt in its criticism of the Ferguson Police Department and provides evidence that city officials "routinely urge Chief Jackson to generate more revenue through enforcement." "Ferguson police officers from all ranks told us that revenue generation is stressed heavily within the police department, and that the message comes from city leadership," the report states. The report also discusses how the city is prolific at issuing citations and arrest warrants. "Between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2014, the City of Ferguson issued approximately 90,000 citations and summonses for municipal violations," the report says. Further research shows that 32,975 warrants were issued in 2013 by the Ferguson courts. That last figure, the number of warrants issued by Ferguson courts, was the number Cleaver was trying to cite, Jones told us. However, Cleaver said citations, not warrants — and that makes a difference. Ferguson city clerk Megan Asikainen told PolitiFact Missouri that Ferguson issued 12,940 traffic and criminal citations in 2013. That means Cleaver was off by nearly 60 percent. 'Virtually no industry' Cleaver also said Ferguson lived off citations and had "virtually no industry." Kathryn Jamboretz of the Saint Louis Economic Development Partnership called this claim "wildly inaccurate." In 2013, fines and public safety accounted for $2.5 million in city revenue. Although that revenue is significant, it's certainly not the only source of income for the city. A variety of taxes provide the lion's share of revenue; that $2.5 million only represents about 13 percent of Ferguson's $19 million budget. What about the claim that the city has virtually no industry? Ferguson is home to a Fortune 500 company. Emerson Electric ranked 121st on the most recent Fortune 500 list with revenues of more than $24 billion in 2013. Its headquarters is less than a mile from the infamous Quiktrip of West Florissant Avenue that was looted and burned during the protests. Even after the prolonged unrest following the death of Michael Brown, there has been industrial growth in Ferguson and surrounding north St. Louis County. According to the Ferguson Recovery Report, $480 million has been invested into North County, including a $300 million Boeing expansion — which is expected to bring 700 jobs, a $100 million Schnucks distribution warehouse for 400 jobs and a $15 million Centene facility, which is expected to bring 200 new jobs to North County. When asked about his statement that there was "virtually no industry," Cleaver's chief of staff, Jones, told PolitiFact that the congressman was simply stating that the city could not survive in its current state without the extreme revenue generated by traffic and criminal citations. Our ruling Cleaver said Ferguson issued "31,000 citations. That's at least one citation per person plus 10,000 for visitors. The city is still surviving only on traffic tickets; there's virtually no industry there." Cleaver was certainly correct in saying that the municipality of Ferguson issued an abnormally high number of citations and depended on that revenue to help fund city government. That's supported by the Department of Justice report, but his number was more than double the correct figure. His comment about the city surviving only off of tickets is largely hyperbole. Ferguson has been receiving about 13 percent of its revenue from fines and public safety, which provides the city with $2.5 million in revenue. That's a lot, but certainly not the only source of income for the city. Cleaver's point that the Ferguson Police Department was raising revenue for the city is correct, but he cites the wrong numbers and makes a vast generalization about industry in Ferguson. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Emanuel Cleaver	None	None	None	2015-10-22T15:50:06	2015-08-11	['None']
pomt-15244	The Navy "is bringing charges against" a Navy officer who shot at the Chattanooga shooter "for illegally discharging a firearm on federal property."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/04/allen-west/navy-officer-who-shot-chattanooga-shooter-facing-c/	The story about what’s happening to a Navy officer "will make your blood boil," professes a Aug. 1 headline on the blog of former Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., a retired Army lieutenant colonel It stems from the July 16, 2015, shooting in Chattanooga, in which a gunman, Muhammad Abdulazeez, began firing at two military facilities, killing four Marines and a Navy sailor. During the onslaught, the commanding officer at the Navy Operational Support Center in Chattanooga used his personal firearm to fire back at Abdulazeez, according to Navy leaders and the officer himself. While some supporters are circulating a petition to honor the actions of the officer, Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White, West said that the Navy is prosecuting him for using his gun. "Ladies and gents, resulting from the text message I received yesterday, I can confirm that the United States Navy is bringing charges against Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White for illegally discharging a firearm on federal property," West wrote. And West wasn’t the only political figure raising the alarm. Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb, former secretary of the Navy, also tweeted that he had heard the same thing. "Navy charging LCDR Tim White w/ a crime for trying to defend our sailors & Marines in #Chattanooga? He deserves a medal, not an indictment," Webb tweeted. He later added, "The charge being considered is illegally discharging a firearm on federal property." Many readers asked us to look into the claims in West’s blog, which was the source for other posts that proliferated on the Internet. So we took a closer look. Unsubstantiated rumors For the record, the Navy has issued a full denial that they have charged or are planning to charge White with any crime related to the Chattanooga shooting incident, both in posts on Facebook and an interview with PolitiFact. "I can tell you definitively it’s not true," Navy spokesman Lieutenant Junior Grade Johnny Michael told PolitiFact. Michael said an investigation into all aspects of the shooting is under way and is far from finished, so no charges are pending or even being seriously considered at this point. "(Prosecution) is not in the works. We have no plans to press charges," Michael said, declining to speculate further about the course of the investigation. We reached out to White to ask him ourselves, but we didn’t hear back. There are only a handful of media reports on this question, and most of those include a statement from the Navy saying the rumor is false. So how did these rumors start? Webb said on Twitter that he "confirmed with a defense official." West’s blog said he considered the charges confirmed when he received a text message from an unidentified person asking if West could meet with White. We reached out to West for clarification. Through a spokesperson at the National Center for Policy Analysis -- a conservative think tank where he is the CEO -- West deferred comment to Navy officials and White’s attorney, though he did not name the attorney. The blog also linked to an article from a conservative website, Western Journalism, that said White could in theory be punished for violating a policy (not a law) that says only certain employees can carry firearms at military sites. The Western Journalism article does not say that White is facing any criminal charges or other punishment. It’s also worth noting a difference between this policy about carrying firearms at a military site and the potential charges that West and Webb said White would face: illegally discharging a weapon on federal property. There is a federal law that says people are not allowed to use or carry weapons on federal facilities. There is an exemption for some members of the military regarding their ability to carry weapons on federal property, though we don’t know if White fell under this exemption. Our ruling West wrote that the Navy "is bringing charges against" a Navy officer who shot at the Chattanooga shooter "for illegally discharging a firearm on federal property." Certainly no charges were filed at the time West wrote his blog post, and none have been filed to date. To the contrary, the Navy has said that it has "no plans to press charges," and we have found no credible reporting to call the Navy’s official statement into question. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08632	Ron Klein "repeatedly voted in favor of amnesty for illegal immigrants."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/sep/17/allen-west/Allen-West-Ron-Klein-repeatedly-voted-amnesty/	Perhaps one of the few points Democratic U.S. Rep. Ron Klein and his Republican opponent Allen West agree on is that they disagree on a long list of policy issues. On his campaign website the morning of Sept. 16, 2010, West compared his views on several topics with Klein including immigration and the border. West wrote that he "supports the rights of states to secure their border, such as in Arizona. Protecting US citizens must come first." For Klein he wrote: "Repeatedly voted in favor of amnesty for illegal immigrants, even as violence on our southern border is increasing rapidly." In this Truth-O-Meter item, we will explore whether Klein repeatedly voted in favor of amnesty for illegal immigrants. Illegal immigration has become a hot topic nationwide including in Congressional District 22, which spans parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties in South Florida. First, some background on amnesty. It was Republican President Ronald Reagan who "did the A-word," as PolitiFact stated in a 2008 ruling about Rudy Giuliani's claim about Reagan and amnesty. Here is what PolitiFact wrote then: "In 1986, Reagan signed an immigration reform bill, the first in 20 years, that legalized the status for 1.7 million people. Some defenders of the law dispute the term 'amnesty.' But here's how Edwin Meese, Reagan's former attorney general, characterizes what his boss did: 'President Reagan called this what it was: amnesty. Indeed, look up the term 'amnesty' in Black's Law Dictionary, and you'll find it says, 'the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided amnesty for undocumented aliens already in the country.' " Various other recent bills have been linked to the idea of amnesty. Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain made waves when he teamed up with Democrat Edward Kennedy on a bill during the 2005-06 session that PolitiFact wrote "would have granted legal status to most of the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the country, as well as toughen border security and require employers to verify the legal status of workers." But that never made it into law, and was introduced before Klein was sworn into office in January 2007. McCain was also one of the co-sponsors of the DREAM Act in 2007 that would have let Homeland Security give legal resident status to some illegal residents who were students, according to the New York Times 2008 election guide. Klein was not one of the 86 co-sponsors on a related House bill that never made it to a vote. Opponents denounced that effort as amnesty. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S.1348) sponsored in May 2007 by Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, stalled in the Senate and was not voted on in the House. Getting back to West's claim, what did Klein vote on? First we reached out to West campaign manager Josh Grodin in the morning Sept. 16 to ask for his evidence. Grodin said the campaign would respond. While we were waiting for Grodin, we did a Nexis search for Klein and "amnesty" in the past five years. When Klein ran against Republican Congressman Clay Shaw in 2006, the Miami Herald wrote on Aug. 18, 2006, "Klein does not support amnesty or a guest worker program, for example." Klein won that race. When West ran against Klein the first time in 2008, West made a similar claim about amnesty. Shortly before election day, West released a TV ad that criticized "Klein for raising taxes, giving amnesty to illegal immigrants and taking millions from special interests," according to an Oct. 29, 2008, Broward Politics blog in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. Klein campaign spokeswoman Melissa Silverman was quoted as saying "This ad contains blatant falsehoods about Congressman Klein's long record of public service, and lacks any documentation or backup to support its claims. Among other outrageous claims, it includes the charge that Congressman Klein supports so-called 'amnesty' for illegal immigrants, which he has consistently and strongly opposed." The blog does not explain in detail what West was referring to; the blog's link to the ad was no longer active and we could not find the ad on YouTube. In our Nexis search, we found no reference to Klein voting for a bill that included amnesty. Klein's campaign told us that in August, Klein voted for H.R. 6080, which provided emergency supplemental appropriations for border security including, according to the U.S. Library of Congress website, paying for salaries, training and expenses and "construction of up to two Border Patrol forward operating bases along the Southwest Border." The Library of Congress website shows that passed on a voice vote. Grodin got back to us in the evening of Sept. 16 and he told us that the West campaign had made an error. "We made a little bit of a mistake and we corrected it,'' he said. "We changed it on the website. Obviously there haven't been any amnesty bills voted on this session. .... For the record the campaign made a little bit of a mistake and we corrected. It's nothing like flat-out lying on a TV commercial." Here is the new claim by West on his website about immigration and the border: "Ron Klein received a 'C' from Numbers USA, which grades Congress on their positions on immigration. Klein has not publicly supported Arizona's Immigration Bill." Note there is no longer any mention of "amnesty." We pointed out to Grodin that West's amnesty claim about Klein wasn't new -- he made it in an October 2008 ad. But Grodin said he did not work on that campaign and wasn't familiar with that ad. We asked Silverman to comment about West's amnesty claim: "Congressman Klein's position has been consistent and clear: this is a nation of laws, and immigration laws that are on the books have to be fully enforced. For Allen West to accuse Congressman Klein of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants is nothing more than an outright lie." Our conclusion here is crystal clear: West's campaign admits that it wrongly characterized Klein's views on amnesty, and it had done so in the 2008 campaign as well. Illegal immigration is a hot-button emotional topic. We give the West campaign credit for changing the website on the same day we asked questions, but the claim about amnesty was flat-out wrong. We rate this Pants on Fire.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2010-09-17T18:15:50	2010-09-16	['None']

pomt-03725	Abortion coverage is a standard insurance benefit "in nearly 90 percent of private plans sold in the U.S."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/15/naral-pro-choice-america/naral-virginia-says-90-percent-health-care-policie/	The General Assembly on April 3 narrowly approved an amendment by Gov. Bob McDonnell that will ban insurers participating in an upcoming federal health care exchange in Virginia from offering policies that cover most abortions. The action was disappointing to NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia. The group said, among other things, that McDonnell’s proposal would force the exchange to offer more restrictive coverage than most private insurance plans. "McDonnell’s amendment prohibits Virginians participating in the new health exchange from purchasing any insurance plan that includes coverage for abortion -- coverage that currently exists as a standard benefit in nearly 90 percent of private plans sold in the U.S.," NARAL said in a March 26 news release. Two Democrats running for lieutenant governor -- state Sen. Ralph Northam of Norfolk and Aneesh Chopra, former U.S. chief technology officer of the United States -- quickly sent out similar statements. We decided to check NARAL’s claim that abortion coverage is standard in almost 90 percent of the private plans now being sold. We should note McDonnell’s amendment has an exception that allows insurance companies on the exchange to cover abortions in instances of rape, incest or when a mother’s life would be endangered by continuing a pregnancy. NARAL said it got the figure from a 2004 report by the Guttmacher Institute, an organization based in New York City that specializes in research on reproductive health issues. Although Guttmacher supports access to abortion and birth control, its research has been cited by both sides of the abortion debate. NARAL cited a Guttmacher synopsis that says the study examined abortion coverage through private insurance in 2002. It found that 87 percent of typical employer-based policies back then covered "medically necessary or appropriate abortions." Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute, said the definition of "medically necessary or appropriate abortions" is whatever a physician deems is required to protect the "health or mental health of the patient." Guttmacher said its figure on private insurance coverage for abortion did not consider plans that offered benefits only in limited circumstances such as cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of a mother. But the Guttmacher memo also noted another survey examining the issue came up with different results. That study, by Kaiser Family Foundation, found in 2003 that 46 percent of workers with employer-based insurance had coverage for abortion. The Guttmacher and Kaiser studies conducted early last decade offer the only detailed looks available on abortion coverage. Experts have not reconciled the difference in results. We spoke to Jon Gabel, a researcher who helped compile the 2003 Kaiser survey and now is a senior fellow at NORC, a social science research foundation at the University of Chicago. He said the 46 percent Kaiser cited refers to workers who were covered for "elective abortions" that did not involve a medical emergency. Gabel said he interpreted Guttmacher’s study as an examination of abortion coverage for medical necessity. Guttmacher, in a 2011 memo, essentially said the two studies asked different sets of questions that may have led to the different results. Guttmacher did not defend its original finding as definitive. "The actual level of coverage is probably somewhere between the estimates made by Guttmacher and Kaiser, meaning that most Americans with employer-based insurance currently have coverage for abortion," the memo said. Our ruling NARAL said McDonnell’s amendment banning an upcoming health care exchange from offering insurance plans that include abortion denies Virginians "coverage that currently exists as a standard benefit in nearly 90 percent of private plans sold in the U.S." NARAL bases its claim on a 9-year-old study by the Guttmacher Institute that found 87 percent of typical of typical employer-based insurance policies covered "medically necessary or appropriate abortions." Contrary to NARAL’s contention, the findings do not reflect coverage "that currently exists." The research focused on policies that were offered in 2002. Guttmacher never updated its report. The only other major research on abortion coverage was conducted by Kaiser in early 2003 and produced a different result. It found that 46 percent of workers with employer-based insurance had coverage for abortions. Experts have struggled to reconcile the two numbers. Guttmacher, in 2011, said that the "actual level of coverage is probably somewhere between" its estimate and that of Kaiser. So NARAL is citing as gospel an old figure that even its authors undercut. We rate its claim Mostly False.	None	NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia	None	None	None	2013-04-15T08:49:22	2013-03-26	['United_States']
pomt-10766	The signers of the Declaration of Independence were "brave people, most of whom, by the way, were clergymen."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/23/mike-huckabee/1-out-of-56-equals-most-no-it-doesnt/	During the Republican debate, Mike Huckabee said he believes one of the defining issues facing the country is the sanctity of human life. Arguing that the issue is of historical importance, he invoked the Declaration of Independence's rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and said that most of the signers of the declaration were clergymen. Not even close. Only one of the 56 was an active clergyman, and that was John Witherspoon. Witherspoon was a Presbyterian minister and president of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). A few more of the signers were former clergymen, though it's a little unclear just how many. The conservative Heritage Foundation said two other signers were former clergymen. The religion web site Adherents.com said four signers of the declaration were current or former full-time preachers. But everyone agrees only Witherspoon was an active minister when he signed the Declaration of Independence. One issue that may contribute to the confusion about which signers had a history in the clergy is that during the time the Declaration was written, people who studied at universities often received doctorates of divinity, a common degree designation, even if they were not working clergy, said Mary Jenkins of the Independence National Historical Park. As for religious affiliations, all of the signers were Protestant Christians with one exception, Charles Carroll of Maryland, who was Roman Catholic. We'd like to give Huckabee every benefit of the doubt, but even if you consider former clergymen among the signers the best you could come up with is four. Out of 56. That's not "most," that's Pants-on-Fire wrong.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2007-10-23T00:00:00	2007-10-21	['None']

pomt-13304	Hillary Clinton "supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding."	false	/texas/statements/2016/oct/09/ted-cruz/false-ted-cruz-claim-hillary-clinton-backs-unlimit/	Ted Cruz of Texas stirred an Austin crowd by declaring that Hillary Clinton favors abortion without limit. The Republican senator characterized the Democratic presidential nominee’s position after an audience member at the September 2016 Texas Tribune Festival asked why the father of two young girls could support "a candidate who is so openly misogynistic," referring to Cruz’s endorsement the day before of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Cruz stressed his concerns about entrusting Clinton with nominating Supreme Court justices who would, he said, threaten his daughters’ constitutional rights. When he paused, the audience member voiced another question: "Like the right to choose?" Cruz replied that the "right to life" needs to be protected, adding: "I can also tell you even on the question of the right to life that the views of Hillary Clinton on abortion are radical and extreme. Her views: She supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding." Unlimited to the moment of birth? Readers asked us to check this claim. For starters, it’s worth noting that abortions in the weeks leading up to birth are rare; 91 percent in 2012 occurred before the 14th week of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based reproductive health nonprofit. That year, the institute says, 1.3 percent took place in the 21st week or later. Notably too, as of October 2016, Texas ranked among 15 states to have proscribed abortion after about 20 weeks post-fertilization, the institute says. It’s also so that abortions earlier in pregnancy aren’t always available on short notice. Twenty-eight states have statutory waiting periods for an abortion, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016, and 14 states require physician counseling that necessitates two trips to a medical facility prior to an abortion. Clinton through the years And how does Clinton herself characterize her abortion position? We perused her own statements and one of her votes as a New York senator. A January 2016 "fact sheet" on her campaign website states that as president, Clinton will ensure the right to choose an abortion is protected, a reference to the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion. Also, the sheet says, Clinton will "repeal the Hyde amendment to ensure low-income women have access to safe reproductive health care." That's potentially a call for more federally funded abortions in that the Hyde amendment, regularly embraced by Congress since 1976, bars government funding of abortion through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or to save the health or life of the mother. According to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, similar "restrictions affect the appropriations for other federal entities, including the Department of Justice, where federal funds may not be used to perform abortions in the federal prison system, except in cases of rape or if the life of the mother would be endangered." Hyde acts as a rider on federal appropriations bills. As such, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016, it doesn’t have to be "repealed" to be deactivated. Bills on federal spending could just cease to include it. Some states have Hyde-like restrictions on their Medicaid dollars, and would have to change their guidelines to open an avenue to fund abortions if Hyde disappeared at the federal level. Clinton has long said that she’d support a late-term limit on abortion--provided it has exceptions. In 2003, as a senator for New York, Clinton was on the losing end of a 64-33 floor vote to advance the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 later signed into law by President George W. Bush. That change--barring physicians from knowingly performing intact dilation and extraction on a living fetus--had no exception to preserve the health or life of the woman. "Clearly, the administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle see this as an opportunity to begin to eliminate Roe v. Wade," Clinton said at the time, according to an NPR news report, "and the possibility of safe, legal and rare abortions in this country. And many young women don't seem to understand that this is not an option that they can take for granted." Earlier, in an Oct. 8, 2000, candidate debate, Clinton said: "I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I’ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it’s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman’s choice." In March 2016, more recently, Bret Baier of Fox News asked Clinton during a Democratic presidential town hal whether she favors legal restrictions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy. That exchange: BAIER: "Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it’s born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?" CLINTON: "Well, again, let me put this in context, because it's an important question. Right now the Supreme Court is considering a decision that would shut down a lot of the options for women in Texas, and there have been other legislatures that have taken similar steps to try to restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion. "Under Roe v. Wade, which is rooted in the Constitution, women have this right to make this highly personal decision with their family in accordance with their faith, with their doctor. "It's not much of a right if it is totally limited and constrained. "So I think we have to continue to stand up for a woman's right to make these decisions, and to defend Planned Parenthood, which does an enormous amount of good work across our country." BAIER: "Just to be clear, there's no -- without any exceptions?" CLINTON: "No -- I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother. "I object to the recent effort in Congress to pass a law saying after 20 weeks, you know, no such exceptions, because although these are rare, Bret, they sometimes arise in the most complex, difficult medical situation." BAIER: "Fetal malformities and…" CLINTON: "And threats to the woman's health." BAIER: "Sure." CLINTON: "And so I think it is -- under Roe v. Wade, it is appropriate to say, in these circumstances, so long as there's an exception for the life and health of the mother." Abortion at birth? When we inquired about the basis of Cruz’s claim, a Senate office spokesman, Phil Novack, said by email that the ruling in Roe v. Wade and another issued the same day in Doe v. Bolton meant from the start that a woman could obtain an abortion "on demand" up to giving birth. This intepretation presents as extremely permissive the court's stipulation that states may restrict abortion after fetal "viability" except "where necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother." Among analysts quoted by Novack, Michael Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas School of Law wrote in 2003 that it’s "clear to all today that Roe, in tandem with Doe v. Bolton, in fact created a regime of abortion-on-demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy for any reason agreed to by the mother and abortionist." We followed up with Paulsen, who said by email that the court’s allowance of a late-term abortion to protect a woman’s health could extend to "any physical, medical, emotional, psychological, or family reason a woman might evoke. The breadth of the ‘health’ exception/loophole is stunning," Paulsen told us. Other legal scholars challenge this read. To our inquiries, Lawrence Sager, a constitutional expert at the University of Texas School of Law, and Priscilla Smith, a Yale law professor who’s advocated for reproductive rights, each said the mandate that a physician determine if an abortion is needed to protect a woman’s health hasn’t played out lightly. By email, Smith said a physician could lose her or his license to practice or face criminal charges if the judgment that an abortion was needed to protect the woman’s health was later found inappropriate. "Physicians do not take these significant potential penalties lightly," Smith wrote, which she said partly explains the rarity of late-term abortions. "The other reason is that women don't just wake up one day after carrying a pregnancy for six months or more and decide to end it unless there is something really wrong with them," Smith said. Other fact checks Earlier this year, PolitiFact National and the Fact Checker at The Washington Post each noted that Clinton had repeatedly declared she’d support a law limiting late-term abortion if it includes exceptions to protect the health of the woman. PolitiFact National rated False a claim that Clinton "believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child." That ruling noted Clinton had said she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother’s life and health are in danger--which wasn't the same thing as unequivocally supporting abortions "even on the due date." The Fact Checker gave four Pinocchios to a claim that Clinton "supports that a child can be aborted any time up until the moment it is born." Conceding that some abortion opponents deem the "health" exception for abortion a loophole that allows a woman to get a late-term abortion, the story said "the fact remains that Clinton is on record as accepting that there can be restrictions to abortion well before the imminent birth of the baby." Our ruling Cruz said Clinton "supports unlimited abortion on demand up until the moment of birth, including partial-birth abortion, with taxpayer funding." Clinton clearly supports a woman’s right to choose an abortion and she’s called for ending congressional restrictions on Medicaid funding of abortions. However, she’s said since 2000 that she’d support a legislated late-term limit on abortion if it included an exception to protect the health of the woman--which the law against partial-birth abortions does not. She hasn't pitched for unlimited abortion on demand. We rate this statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-12445	"Michael Untermeyer has been a Democrat for more than 40 years."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/may/12/michael-untermeyer/philly-da-candidate-who-used-be-gop-actually-ive-a/	The race to become the Democratic nominee to be district attorney of Philadelphia is anyone’s game at this point, but two candidates have traded barbs more than the rest. Democrats Joe Khan and Michael Untermeyer, both former prosecutors, have spent the last several weeks launching negative attacks against each other ahead of the Tuesday primary. One of the most recent is a television ad spot put out by the Untermeyer campaign that connects Khan to the Bush Administration. In the ad, a narrator also claims that "Michael Untermeyer has been a Democrat for more than 40 years." But a spokesman for Khan’s campaign said that’s "laughable," pointing out that Untermeyer twice ran for local political office as a Republican and told a columnist last fall that "only a Democrat can win this office." So who’s right? Prior to the current race to be the Philadelphia district attorney, Untermeyer unsuccessfully ran for political office three times. In 2007, he ran for sheriff as a Democrat; in 2009 he ran for district attorney as a Republican; and in 2011 he ran for City Council, also as a Republican. Sam Miller, a spokesman for Untermeyer’s campaign, said Untermeyer has been a Democrat for more than 40 years in total, but not consecutively. He said Untermeyer, who is 66, first registered as a Democrat in New York ahead of the 1972 presidential election, when the campaign says he voted for Democratic Sen. George McGovern, who lost to then-President Richard Nixon. Miller said Untermeyer moved to Philadelphia in the 1980s and remained a registered Democrat through 2009, when he switched his party registration to Republican before his first run for district attorney. Untermeyer addressed this himself in a 2009 Philadelphia Inquirer profile, saying before his run for DA: "I was a Democrat until, like, 10 weeks ago." The writer continued: "The Democratic field for district attorney was crowded, and, [Untermeyer] said, he joined the race too late to become known before tomorrow's primary. He figured that as a Republican, he'd be the lone candidate and have until November to present himself." Untermeyer’s current campaign says he switched back to Democrat in 2014, meaning that he would have been a registered Democrat for a total of about 41 years. Their claims about party switching in the 2000s also check out. City records show Untermeyer changed his registration from Democrat to Republican in February 2009, then switched back from Republican to Democrat in July 2014. But counties in Pennsylvania switched to a statewide voter registration system in the early 2000s, so there’s no record of Untermeyer’s party affiliation in current voter systems from prior to 2006. The earliest voter registration form the campaign could produce was from 2003 and showed Untermeyer was a registered Democrat at the time. The Board of Elections in New York City wasn’t able to pull Untermeyer’s voter history, and the New York state Board of Elections confirmed Untermeyer is no longer a registered voter in New York. That office also was unable to pull historical data on Untermeyer’s party affiliation there. So though Untermeyer has taken heat from Khan’s campaign for his past voter registration, his campaign is unable to prove he was a registered Democrat before 2003. But there’s also no evidence suggesting the contrary. The Untermeyer campaign is defending their candidate’s "progressive" values, saying he has believed in the priorities "of the Democratic Party since he was at least 12 years old," producing a letter dated June 1963 from the Office of President John F. Kennedy that was responding to a correspondence from Untermeyer advocating for passage of civil rights legislation. Our ruling In a recent campaign ad, a narrator claimed Michael Untermeyer "has been a Democrat for more than 40 years." There’s nothing to suggest that isn’t true, though the campaign was unable to produce — and PolitiFact was unable to locate — any voter registration forms from prior to 2003. But the claim is leaving out a caveat: He wasn’t a Democrat for more than 40 years consecutively, and it certainly wasn’t the last 40 years. Untermeyer spent five of the last 10 years as a registered Republican. We rate the claim [Half True/Mostly True/True].	None	Michael Untermeyer	None	None	None	2017-05-12T10:00:00	2017-05-10	['None']

pomt-06082	"[Renewable energy] projects . . . get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/08/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-development-solar-p/	The environmental benefits of renewable energy are pretty clear, but the economics can still be muddy. Installing wind turbines and solar panels is expensive. That’s why grants, low-interest loans and tax credits are so important to the industry. A key federal incentive came up for debate Dec. 13 on the floor of the U.S. Senate. At issue was the future of the 1603 Treasury grant program, which was created as part of the Obama administration’s stimulus package in 2009. The program offered grants equal to 30 percent of a renewable energy project’s cost. In what would ultimately be an unsuccessful fight to extend the grant program into 2012, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke up at the hearing. In prepared remarks, he said the program is vital to the industry and that its termination would threaten jobs and projects. "Let me just bring it home," Whitehouse said, as he referred to his notes. "In Rhode Island, this [grant program] has facilitated solar panel installations on three new bank branches. The TD Bank has opened up in Barrington, in East Providence and in Johnston, Rhode Island. Those projects created jobs, they put people to work, they lowered the cost for these banks of their electrical energy, and they get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply." That’s a lot of potential benefits from TD Bank’s projects, but we’re interested in just one of them -- that the development of solar power and other forms of renewable energy will, in the senator’s words, "get us off foreign oil." PolitiFact Rhode Island assessed a similar claim last March after state Rep. Jon Brien said that a proposed waste-to-energy plant in Woonsocket was needed because "residents are paying through the nose for electricity fueled by foreign oil." We ruled the statement Pants on Fire because New England -- and, in fact, the nation as a whole -- gets only a tiny fraction of its electricity from oil-fired power plants. We thought we should revisit the issue, however, because it’s a claim that comes up frequently in support of renewable energy. Whitehouse takes it a step further by framing the issue in terms of national security. The foundation of the claim is the presumption that the United States uses oil to generate its electricity. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency under the Department of Energy, in 2010, petroleum was used to generate less than 1 percent of the country’s power. More than two thirds of the electricity in the United States came from burning coal and natural gas, with much of the balance from nuclear energy and hydroelectric power. Oil is seldom used because its cost has risen so high. As for Rhode Island, the state is part of the New England power grid in which electricity flows across state lines. In 2010, 0.4 percent of New England’s power was fueled by oil, according to a chart provided by ISO-New England, the nonprofit that manages the grid. Natural gas plants provided the most power with a share of 32 percent, followed by nuclear stations (29 percent), dual-fuel plants that can burn natural gas and oil (12 percent), coal plants (11 percent), hydropower facilities (6 percent), other renewable energy sources (6 percent) and imported energy from New York and Canada (4 percent). There are plants in New England that use oil. For example, one of Brayton Point Power Station’s units burns oil, generating 28 percent of the facility’s output, according to a spokesman for Dominion Generation. But other oil-burning plants don’t operate as much these days -- in fact, many go on line only when demand is highest, say, on hot summer days when air conditioners are turned up -- because oil is so expensive and natural gas, especially, is so cheap. In Rhode Island, of the nine significant power plants in the state, only three can use oil as well as natural gas, according to Thomas Kogut, spokesman for the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. The rest exclusively use natural gas. The only plant that relies entirely on oil is on Block Island and serves only about 1,000 people for most of the year. Only a fraction of 1 percent of the state’s electric generation came from oil in 2010. But there is something else. After asking for an explanation of Whitehouse’s comments, his office did point out one way that renewable energy would lessen oil usage. Seth Larson, spokesman for the senator, referred to the New England power grid and what happens on peak demand days in the summer. On those days, usage spikes, going from a typical load of, say, 18,000 megawatts, to 25,000 megawatts or more. In order to meet demand, oil-fired plants kick on. Despite the high costs, these power plants come on line because there’s no alternative source of power. Larson said that if more renewable energy is developed it will reduce the need to use oil when the grid is stretched. ISO-New England confirmed that oil is used more on days when demand for power is high. For example, on July 22, 2011, the second-highest demand day ever in the region, oil provided 14 percent of the grid’s power, according to a spokeswoman for ISO-New England. But days like that are isolated and the amount of oil used doesn’t add up to much relative to annual totals. We also checked with Seth Kaplan, vice president of policy and climate advocacy at the Conservation Law Foundation, a regional environmental advocacy group. He said that renewable energy can make a real difference when demand for power spikes. And peak demand days, he said, typically occur on sunny days when solar power systems perform best. Kaplan also said that there is a larger point to be made in reference to Whitehouse’s comments. Reducing the country’s reliance on oil is a process. If more sources of renewable energy come on line and if those sources are used to power electric and hybrid vehicles, then demand for oil could drop significantly. That’s because the bulk of the oil used in the United States -- 72 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration -- goes to fueling cars, trucks and planes. Before we make our ruling, there are other issues with Whitehouse’s comments about the importance of the 1603 grant program that need to be pointed out. Along with TD Bank’s solar power systems, he cites three other projects in Rhode Island that were helped by the grants: a wind turbine at Hodges Badge Company in Portsmouth, a proposed solar farm in East Providence and three wind turbines that are set to go up at the Narragansett Bay Commission in Providence. There are problems with some of his examples and details that need to be clarified with others. TD Bank did indeed benefit from Treasury grants, but a spokesman for the company said the projects would have been done with or without federal assistance. In other words, the grants were not crucial to their development. In his remarks, Whitehouse said that Hodges Badge "has just gone completely green energy." At the time, however, the company’s turbine had not been installed. It wasn’t put up until Jan. 4. Hodges Badge has been approved for a Treasury grant but has yet to receive the money, said Rick Hodges, president of the company. The Narragansett Bay Commission has started construction on three wind turbines at its Fields Point facility on the Providence waterfront, but the project is receiving no money whatsoever from the Treasury program. Because it’s a quasi-public agency, it would never have qualified for the grants, said Jamie Samons, spokeswoman for the commission. The solar farm being planned in East Providence did not receive a Treasury grant because not enough work was done on the project before the program expired. Jeanne Boyle, director of city planning, said East Providence could have qualified for a grant because it has partnered in the project with a private developer. Despite the termination of the 1603 program, the project is still in the works. Our ruling Whitehouse said on the Senate floor that renewable energy projects would "get us off foreign oil" and away from "foreign entanglements that we have to get into to defend our oil supply." His comments demand further explanation. Oil-powered plants provide a tiny amount of the power used in Rhode Island. That’s also true for New England. And the United States as a whole. For the most part, these plants only come on line when demand is highest a few times a year. But a layperson would assume something different from the senator’s statement -- that oil is a large part of our generating supply and that alternative energy projects would substantially reduce oil consumption. The truth is investments in solar and wind power, such as the projects the senator cites, won’t have a large effect on oil consumption. Because of this misimpression -- and because of the other inaccuracies in Whitehouse’s speech that we noted -- our ruling on the claim is Mostly False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-02349	Broward County’s unemployment rate of 5.3 percent is "the lowest in Florida."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/21/barbara-sharief/mayor-barbara-sharief-says-broward-county-has-lowe/	On March 21, former Florida governor Jeb Bush -- a potential Republican presidential candidate -- attracted national media attention when he gave a speech at the Broward Workshop’s annual State of the County event on March 21. Prior to Bush’s speech in Davie to business and civic leaders, Broward Mayor Barbara Sharief took a turn at the podium to tout the host county’s recent economic success. "Our unemployment rate is at 5.3 percent, the lowest in Florida, and it has remained that way for more than a year now," Sharief said. We wondered whether Sharief, a Democrat from Miramar, was correct. We checked with Sharief after Bush had finished speaking, and she reiterated her claim. She said the prior month’s rate, for December 2013, fell as low as 5 percent before increasing to 5.3 percent in January 2014. "Our rate couldn’t go lower," Sharief said. Sharief said her source was from the county’s public relations office, and when we asked a spokeswoman, Kimberly Maroe, she located it -- a news release from February 2014 that used the 5 percent statistic from December 2013, which was the most recent data at the time. The news release said, "Overall Broward excelled in many areas such as low unemployment, where at 5 percent, has remained the lowest unemployment rate among large urban counties in Florida for more than a year." But that’s not exactly what Sharief said at the Broward Workshop event. She said, "the lowest in Florida," not "the lowest in Florida among large urban counties." Does it make a difference? Our research suggests that it does. First, we looked to see whether Broward did indeed have the lowest unemployment rate in Florida among "large urban counties." This requires a bit of guessing, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal tabulator of unemployment data, doesn’t have a definition for "large, urban counties." But we were able to assemble a list by seeing which counties in the state ranked both in the 10 largest counties by population and the 10 most densely populated counties. Nine counties fit both requirements: Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Lee, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pinellas and Seminole. When we looked at the most recent county-level unemployment rates available from BLS, which are from December 2013, we found that Broward did indeed have the lowest among that group. So if Sharief had communicated the talking point correctly during her remarks in Davie, she would have been correct. But she didn’t, so we next looked at whether Broward’s rate was "the lowest in Florida." It turns out that among all of Florida’s 67 counties, Broward does pretty well in this regard -- it ranks eighth-lowest statewide -- but this doesn’t make Broward’s rate "the lowest in Florida." Here’s the list of Florida’s eight lowest county-wide unemployment rates for December 2013. All of the counties ranking better than Broward, with the exception of Monroe, are in the northern part of the state: 1. Monroe County: 3.5 percent 2. Walton County: 4.0 percent 3. Okaloosa County: 4.4 percent 4. St. Johns County: 4.7 percent 5. Alachua County: 4.7 percent 6. Jackson County: 4.8 percent 7. Jefferson County: 4.9 percent 8. Broward County: 5.0 percent Broward’s rate also isn’t Florida’s lowest unemployment rate for a metropolitan area, a category that BLS does track. For January 2014, the most recent month available for this statistic, the 5.3 percent unemployment rate for Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-Deerfield Beach was lower than for other large metro areas, such as Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall (6.9 percent), Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater (6.5 percent), West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Boynton Beach (6.3 percent), Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford (6.0 percent) and Jacksonville (6.0 percent). But two smaller metro areas had an unemployment rate lower than metro Fort Lauderdale -- Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin (5.0 percent) and Gainesville (5.1 percent). We’ll note that some experts urge against reading too much into one month’s worth of statistics. "My strong instinct is to be skeptical of county-level data based on a single-month estimate of anything, including the unemployment rate," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. "My hunch is that there’s a lot of ‘noise,’ and that the amount of ‘signal’ might be questionable." We also wondered whether there is any reason why Broward might be doing relatively well, employment-wise. Sharief gave some credit to Broward’s ordinance that encourages contractors to use local workers -- a policy implemented many years ago, but which she said is now paying off. She also said an airport expansion has helped. During Sharief’s speech, Broward County Commissioner Stacy Ritter gave a shout-out on Twitter to certain construction projects that she said were creating jobs. Mark Vitner, managing director and senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, agreed that Fort Lauderdale’s recovery "has gained considerable momentum over the past year, as hiring in business and professional services has picked up." But at least some of the airport and construction in question jobs are temporary jobs. And more troublesome to independent experts is that Broward’s relatively good unemployment rate obscures other longer-term employment indicators that aren’t so rosy. Chris Lafakis, a Moody’s senior economist who tracks Florida, said that among the six largest metropolitan areas and divisions in Florida, Fort Lauderdale has been "dead last in payroll employment growth since December 2007, which is the month the recession began." The reason for this seemingly paradoxical situation -- a low unemployment rate despite weak employment growth -- stems from relatively slow growth in the size of the metro area’s labor force, Lafakis said. "It’s true that projects like airport expansion are helping Broward’s economy, but the low unemployment rate is overstating strength in Broward County’s labor market," Lafakis said. Our ruling Sharief said Broward’s unemployment rate of 5.3 percent is "the lowest in Florida." The rate -- which is indeed 5.3 percent -- is the lowest in Florida among large urban counties. But it’s not the lowest in Florida. Seven counties and two smaller metropolitan areas have lower unemployment rates in the most recent data. Because she phrased her otherwise accurate talking point inaccurately in her speech, in a way that makes the county seem to be No. 1 when it's not, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02154	"On (Tom) Wolf’s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/02/tom-corbett/pa-gov-tom-corbett-attacks-democratic-rival-tom-wo/	Pennsylvania’s Republican governor, Tom Corbett, is widely considered one of the most vulnerable governors seeking re-election in 2014. Recently, he’s begun targeting Tom Wolf, the Democrat who has become the frontrunner in a four-way Democratic primary. Since March, Wolf has led Corbett in general-election polls by between seven and 19 percentage points. In a radio ad released April 30, 2014, Corbett’s campaign took aim at Wolf’s record when he was serving as Pennsylvania’s revenue secretary, an appointed position that handles tax collection. Wolf was appointed to the position by then-Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat, and confirmed by the state Senate, which was in Republican hands. He served as revenue secretary from April 2007 until November 2008. Here’s what Corbett’s ad said: Wolf "conveniently left out of his ads that he was the state’s revenue secretary in Harrisburg. You know, the top tax collector. And Wolf was a job-killing bureaucrat. On Wolf’s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs, and our unemployment went up almost 50 percent. But the real insult? Wolf is a millionaire, but he fought to increase taxes on average Pennsylvanians, including higher taxes on home heating and the sales tax. Tom Wolf: high taxes, fewer jobs." That’s a lot of claims for a brief ad, but for this fact-check we’re going to focus on the claim that "on Wolf’s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs." For claims like this one, we take into account two factors -- whether the statistics cited are accurate, and whether it’s reasonable to assign credit or blame to the target of the ad. So we’ll take this claim point by point. With this ad, the statistics quoted are reasonable, but the blame is off-base -- especially the cause of Pennsylvania's job loss. To the extent that taxes were high, was Wolf responsible? We won’t address whether taxes were too high in Pennsylvania, since that’s an opinion on which reasonable people can disagree. But we can judge whether Wolf bears responsibility for the state of Pennsylvania’s taxes while he was serving as revenue secretary. First, here’s Corbett’s argument. A Corbett spokesman, Billy Pitman, noted that the Tax Foundation found Pennsylvania to have the 10th highest tax burden among states in 2007 and 2008. (The Tax Foundation is a think tank that generally has a pro-business leaning.) Pitman said the ad was referring to some specific taxes Wolf advocated for. "In his position as the commonwealth’s top tax collector, Secretary Wolf lobbied the legislature on behalf of the Rendell administration he served," Pitman said. Among the proposals Pitman specifically cited were an increase to the sales tax, an oil-company tax and hikes to electricity and garbage-collection taxes. The Corbett campaign has a point that Wolf, as a member of Rendell’s cabinet, advocated for some tax hikes (though also for some reductions); we found news reports to back that up. However, the ad exaggerates Wolf’s influence on the shape of tax policy in the state. First, Pennsylvania’s tax landscape was set well before Wolf got on the job. In April 2007, corporate taxes accounted for about one-fifth of tax revenues, sales taxes accounted for about one-quarter, and personal income taxes accounted for about 55 percent. This means that adding a percentage point to the state sales tax, as Wolf advocated, would have represented a modest increase to a levy that represented just one-quarter of the state’s overall tax revenue. The other taxes he advocated for would have had an even more modest impact on the state’s overall tax architecture. Why does this matter? Because the ad said that "on Wolf’s watch, taxes were high." This suggests that Wolf is to blame for the state’s overall tax structure, rather than just for proposing marginal expansions. In reality, most of the state’s tax structure was already well-established before Wolf was even sworn in, so it’s a stretch to lay the blame for "high taxes" at his feet. Second, the ad overhypes how much impact Wolf had on tax policy as revenue secretary. While Wolf certainly engaged in at least some advocacy, as the newspaper articles noted, his job duties were exclusively administrative, not policy-setting. The secretary’s job, according to the department’s website, is to "administer the tax laws of the commonwealth in a fair and equitable manner." Raising taxes or creating new ones is up to the governor and the Legislature (which during his tenure had one chamber controlled by the Republicans). "The revenue secretary collects the taxes and issues reports on the state's financial health, and the subjects and rates of taxation are set by state law," said Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. "Policies dealing with economic and community development, jobs programs, taxes and other recession-fighting measures are handled by the governor and the Legislature." Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., agreed that the ad assigned too much responsibility for setting tax policy to Wolf. "The claims in this ad are really loose, and as is the case in almost all negative ads, very lacking in context," he said. Was Wolf culpable in killing 100,000 Pennsylvania jobs? We did find a basis for the ad’s claim that 100,000 Pennsylvania jobs were lost during Wolf’s tenure. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed Pennsylvanians rose by 150,000 between April 2007 and November 2008. However, the problem with this part of the claim is that it’s a stretch to blame taxes in general -- much less Wolf specifically -- for the loss of these jobs (especially their "killing," in the ad’s overheated rhetoric). We asked Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, how much straight-line causation we can draw between tax policy and those job losses. "Basically none," Sinclair said, saying the much bigger factor during that period was the national economic downturn, which officially became a recession almost halfway through Wolf’s tenure. While she acknowledged that tax policy can affect job growth, Sinclair added that "economists disagree wildly on the ‘job-killing’ effects of taxes. So, confidently drawing any line of causation is impossible. And throw in that the entire country lost about 2.3 million jobs over that period. I don't think it was the high taxes of Pennsylvania that caused the job losses." Our ruling Corbett’s ad claimed that "on Wolf’s watch, taxes were high, killing 100,000 PA jobs." The ad has a point that Wolf, as a Rendell appointee, did at times give rhetorical support to some of the governor’s proposed tax hikes (as well as some proposed tax reductions). But the ad exaggerates the influence that Wolf, as the operational head of the state’s tax-collection department, had on crafting tax policy. Most of the state’s tax structure was set long before he took office, and most of his job was to carry out tax laws, not craft them. Meanwhile, the ad suggests that taxes are to blame for the job losses on his watch, when in fact Wolf’s time in office coincided with the start of the national economic downturn -- a much more plausible reason for rising unemployment. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Tom Corbett	None	None	None	2014-05-02T15:20:22	2014-04-30	['None']
pomt-14945	Georgia has the highest flu activity in the country.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/oct/26/centers-disease-control/georgia-briefly-tops-chart-flu-reports/	The flu season is upon us. But is it hitting the Peach State harder than other places? We wondered after seeing a map on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website Thursday, showing Georgia with the highest flu activity in the country, and hearing television reports repeating the claim. The short answer: Not really. Flu season starts in October and can run into May. It typically peaks in Georgia by early January, with upticks after Thanksgiving and Christmas when germs are often passed like holiday feasts. Flu vaccines are designed to protect against the main flu viruses that research suggests will be the most common of the season. This year’s vaccines protect against three viruses. The CDC develops its "flu view" map based on weekly reports from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico of outpatient visits to doctors for treatment of flu-like symptoms. The information is voluntarily submitted by doctors’ offices to their state public health departments. States on the CDC map are assigned to one of four levels of influenza-like illness activity -- minimal, low, moderate, or high. Georgia was identified as having "low" flu activity in the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, the most recent period for which outpatient information was available on Thursday. But that was a notch above the rest of the nation, which this early in flu season fell in the minimal range. "The biggest takeaway is the flu is here," said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health, "and if you don’t have a flu shot, you need to get one." Georgia did not report any hospitalizations or deaths due to the flu in that week, Nydam said. South Carolina, meanwhile, had four flu deaths but showed up with less flu activity on the CDC map because the map -- again -- is based on how many people see a doctor, not how many die. "It’s really misleading," Nydam said. "The numbers (of patients with flu-like symptoms) are so low." Georgia reported 22,273 patients visiting doctor’ offices in the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, with 379 of those patients or 1.7 percent exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Compare that to a report from a week in December 2014, when 20,835 people visited doctors, 1,643 or 7.89 percent with flu-like symptoms. Changes come quickly If Georgia was identified as the state with the highest flu activity on Thursday, it was a different story Friday. That’s because on Friday the Georgia Department of Public Health had later, data from the week starting Oct. 11. It showed Georgia’s flu activity down in the minimal range, where the rest of the country had been the week before. (Of 25,876 patients, 355 or 1.37 percent had flu-like symptoms. South Carolina and Alaska jumped ahead of Georgia in activity, but they were just higher in the minimal range, Nydam said. The CDC doesn’t look at the flu activity in isolation, said Lynnette Brammer, CDC epidemiologist. The map is just one of nine resources that the CDC uses to track increases in flu-like illnesses across the country, she said. "You take a look at all those pieces, including laboratory data, and you can get a pretty complete picture of flu that comes in contact with health care systems," Brammer said. "With flu, you should never look at just one piece." Doctors report cases where patients complain of flu-like symptoms -- fever, cough or sore throat, she said. "That flu-like illness may have been flu or may not have been," Brammer said. Our ruling Georgia had the highest flu activity in the country based on data provided by doctors offices across the country and mapped by the CDC for the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10. That information factors into the CDC’s efforts to track what goes on through flu season. But it’s based on data submitted voluntarily and that, as we have seen, can change week -to-week. That’s important context that downgrades the statement to Mostly True.	None	Centers for Disease Control	None	None	None	2015-10-26T00:00:00	2015-10-22	['None']

pomt-02862	Obamacare "was the Republican plan in the early '90s."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/15/ellen-qualls/aca-gop-health-care-plan-1993/	If there’s one thing conservatives might hate more than Obamacare, it’s hearing that Obamacare springs from Republican ideas. The Heritage Foundation, the granddaddy of the right-wing think tanks, fumed when President Barack Obama said it was the source of the concept of the health insurance marketplaces where people could shop for the best deal. (We rated Obama's claim Mostly True.) Squaring off with Sean Hannity on his Fox News Channel show, Democratic public relations consultant Ellen Qualls could barely get these words out: Qualls: History lesson. This was the Republican plan ... Hannity: This was not the Republican plan. Qualls: … in the early '90s. Hannity: No Republican supported it. Not one Republican voted for this. Qualls: Yes, in the '90s ... Hannity: That’s a lie. Qualls: … during the Clinton administration, this was the ‘Let’s fix the private insurance system ... Hannity: No. No. Qualls: … and make it work’, instead of making it a government system. Time out! Is the Affordable Care Act really the same as "the Republican plan in the early '90s?" Short answer -- sort of. There was a Republican bill in the Senate that looked a whole lot like Obamacare, but it wasn’t the only GOP bill on Capitol Hill, it never came to a vote and from what we can tell, plenty of conservative Republicans didn’t like it. Qualls told PunditFact that she was thinking of the Senate bill. 1993: Health care takes center stage President Bill Clinton took on an ill-fated effort to reform health care in 1993. As the president’s task force (led by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton) worked behind closed doors to craft solutions to ever-rising health care costs and a growing number of uninsured families, Republicans scrambled to forge an alternative. Republican Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island was the point man. The bill he introduced, Health Equity and Access Reform Today, (yes, that spells HEART) had a list of 20 co-sponsors that was a who’s who of Republican leadership. There was Minority Leader Bob Dole, R- Kan., Sens. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and many others. There also were two Democratic co-sponsors. Among other features, the Chafee bill included: An individual mandate; Creation of purchasing pools; Standardized benefits; Vouchers for the poor to buy insurance; A ban on denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition. "You would find a great deal of similarity to provisions in the Affordable Care Act," Sheila Burke, Dole’s chief of staff in 1993, told PunditFact via email. "The guys were way ahead of the times!! Different crowd, different time, suffice it to say." That said, the Senate plan from 1993 was not identical to the health care law that passed in 2010. The Republican bill did not expand Medicaid as Obamacare does, and it did have medical malpractice tort reform, which the current law does not. In contrast to the current employer mandate, the Chafee bill required employers to offer insurance, but they were under no obligation to help pay for it. Policy differences aside, health care scholar and former Clinton adviser Paul Starr at Princeton University said the Affordable Care Act is distinct in one other important way. "The Chafee plan did not spell out how increased coverage would be financed," Starr said. "It was more of a symbolic bill than an actual piece of legislation." In fact, after the bill was introduced, the Senate never took it up again. Conservative pushback Even before Chafee brought his bill forward, some conservatives were trying to scuttle it. More hard-line senators such as Phil Gramm, R-Texas, House Republicans and the Heritage Foundation saw the Chafee bill as an unacceptable compromise. What they wanted was outright defeat of the president’s approach. No single alternative emerged, but there were a variety of Republican proposals. One in the House drew more co-sponsors than any other, 72 of them. It was called the Action Now Health Reform Act, but its scope was limited. Much of it focused on insurance for small businesses and the self-employed. It offered some protections for people with pre-existing conditions and included changes in medical malpractice law. There was a smorgasbord of other House Republican bills. Like Chafee’s bill, none of them went anywhere. Our ruling Qualls said the Affordable Care Act "was the Republican plan in the '90s." The bill she had in mind did have a strong roster of Republicans behind it, and it did share many major features with the Affordable Care Act. There were some significant differences but in a side-by-side comparison, the similarities dominate. However, to call it the Republican plan, as though a majority of Republicans endorsed it, goes too far. The House Republicans took a different path, and there was opposition from more hard-line members of the Republican coalition. It is telling that the Chafee bill never became a full blown bill and never came up for a vote. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-11163	"Just in: John Kerry facing prison."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/24/conservative-stories/there-no-evidence-john-kerry-headed-prison/	A story on Facebook said that former Secretary of State John Kerry is headed to prison for allegedly meeting with Iranian leaders in an attempt to save the nuclear agreement he helped broker during President Barack Obama’s administration. "Just in: John Kerry facing prison," said the May 21 headline on Conservative Stories, a website that supports President Donald Trump. The website copied the story about Kerry from the Any Politics website. "SHARE this story if you think John Kerry should be LOCKED UP!" the story said. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. Republican operatives have claimed that Kerry met secretly with Iranian officials in Paris just days after Trump announced the United States’ withdrawal from the international accord. Trump had promised during the campaign to renegotiate the deal. As their supposed proof, operatives have pointed to a May 12 tweet of a photo by a lobbyist with the firm Turnberry Solutions that appeared to show Kerry walking near the trendy L’Avenue restaurant in the French capital’s Champs-Elysées neighborhood. "So John Kerry just left a meeting @ L’Avenue in Paris w/3 Iranians. A friend was sitting next to their table and heard JK blasting @realDonaldTrump. The Iranians had a 5 person security detail and left in diplomatic vehicles. Is he FARA registered?" Jason Osborne tweeted, referring to the Foreign Agents Registration Act that requires Americans to disclose activities taken on behalf of foreign governments. No Iranians were in the photo. But people produced other photos of Iranians, reportedly in Paris. An Iranian dissident named M. Hanif Jazayeri identified the photographed Iranians as former Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Kharazi and Iran's Ambassador to France Abolghassem Delfi. To be clear, none of the photos showed Kerry and the Iranians together. The tweet followed reports about Kerry’s unsuccessful 11th hour bid to preserve a deal he played an instrumental role in crafting. Kerry was in Paris at the time his photo was allegedly taken, his office has told PolitiFact. But his team denied any Paris meeting with Iranians took place. What does this have to do with Kerry "facing prison"? Trump and right-wing backers challenged Kerry’s actions as violating the 18th century Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized American citizens from working to undermine U.S. foreign policy. The law says that the punishment for violating the act is a fine or imprisonment of not more than three years, or both. But the Conservative Stories website, which has no contact information, provided no actual evidence that Kerry was found in violation of the act and faces prison. Two University of Chicago Law professors, Daniel J. Hemel, and Eric A. Posner, wrote in the Lawfare blog in December that there are only two known instances in which individuals have been indicted for violating the Logan Act, the last of which came in 1853, and neither indictment resulted in conviction. The story said Kerry was caught "blatantly commiting treason." But again, the story provides no evidence beyond the photos. Treason is defined in the U.S. Constitution as consisting "only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort." Treason trials are rare in the U.S. So, to recap: Whether Kerry and the Iranians met is contended. As such; There is no evidence Kerry violated the Logan Act. And even if he did; Nobody has been convicted of violating the Logan Act, ever. Our ruling A headline said "Just in: John Kerry facing prison." The story relies on a tweet that showed Kerry was in Paris -- that part is true. But the allegations that Kerry was meeting with Iranian officials in an attempt to salvage the international nuclear agreement are unproven. So saying he violated any law is nothing more than guesswork. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03138	The United States "stood alone in the war in Iraq."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-bush-invaded-iraq-alone-syria/	As the United States debates using force in Syria following its alleged use of chemical weapons on Aug. 21, 2013, many members of Congress have criticized President Barack Obama’s threat to dictator Bashar Assad as a bad diplomatic move. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., defended him when she spoke with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, comparing Obama’s international credibility favorably in comparison with that of his predecessor, George W. Bush. "You know, President George W. Bush had significantly degraded our international influence around the world," she said. "We stood alone in the war in Iraq. We were roundly criticized and rightfully so. And today, we have 35 nations that signed the statement in support of the U.S.'s commitment to strike. ... So President Obama's leadership has rebuilt our credibility around the world with leaders that was decimated in the previous administration." Blitzer pushed back against her argument, noting that the British Parliament, "our closest ally wouldn't even support potential U.S. military strikes in Syria." Wasserman is right that some countries, such as France, have backed a potential strike this time around. But Britain and others are opposed. Here, we’ll focus on fact-checking her statement about Iraq, in which she claimed that the United States didn’t have the support of other nations. A reader emailed us, asking if Wasserman Schultz was right. Her office did not return requests for comment. We should start by noting that Bush received a lot of criticism for the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 because he didn’t have backing from the United Nations. But the United States didn’t go in alone. In fact, Bush claimed the support of 35 countries for the action in his March 2003 address to the nation declaring war. "More than 35 countries are giving crucial support, from the use of naval and air bases, to help with intelligence and logistics, to the deployment of combat units. Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense," he said. Later that month, the White House released a list of 49 nations that had "already begun military operations to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, and enforce 17 (United Nations Security Council) resolutions." We should also point out that support from British Prime Minister Tony Blair was particularly strong. "Tell our allies that at the very moment of action, at the very moment when they need our determination that Britain faltered? I will not be party to such a course. This is not the time to falter," Blair said at the end of a long, passionate speech before the House of Commons in favor of invading. Great Britain had troops stationed in Iraq until 2009, while the United States pulled out in 2011. Our ruling When Blitzer asked about Obama's decision to strike Syria, Wasserman Schultz defended the president and argued that he has support, unlike when the United States "stood alone" against Iraq. Although Democrats often criticize Bush for invading Iraq without more global backing, including that of the United Nations, Bush did put together a coalition. Nearly 50 countries, most notably Britain, ultimately supported the invasion, with many sending troops of their own. That's roughly on par with the support network that Obama has put together for action against Syria, and possibly exceeds it. We rate her claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-11485	Says Florida has "roughly 1,500 resource officers dealing with about 3,800 schools."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/mar/02/bill-galvano/taking-closer-look-number-school-resource-officers/	State Sen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, wants additional school resource officers to be part of any school safety package from the Legislature after the Parkland, Fla., shooting. "We have gaps in our school resource officers. We need more school resource officers," Galvano said during a Senate Rules Committee meeting Feb. 26. "Right now, we have roughly 1,500 resource officers dealing with about 3,800 schools." The committee approved SB 7026, which would increase the number of officers, raise the age to purchase any firearm to 21, and establish a three-day waiting period for gun purchases. School resource officers have been a major topic of discussion since the shooting, despite the fact that there was an officer on campus when the attack happened. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel suspended the only armed school resource officer at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Scot R. Peterson, after Israel said he took cover outside of the building instead of confronting the gunman. Peterson resigned. Still, Galvano and others want more officers in schools. And Gov. Rick Scott has proposed a separate $450 million plan that would in part go toward the goal of having a resource officer in every school. Is the officer-to-school ratio as imbalanced as Galvano said? We found it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of schools served by resource officers, in part because multiple schools can share an officer, and officers are funded through various pots of money. But Galvano's overall point that not every school has a school resource officer is accurate. Counting officers Galvano’s information traces back to the Safe Schools Appropriation Expenditures Report from the state Department of Education. According to the document, there were 1,517 resource and law enforcement officers who served a total of 2,432 schools in the 2015-16 school year (the most recent year provided). The department's report counted the number of school resource officers and law enforcement officers at elementary, middle, high, alternative and "combination" schools. In Broward County, home of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, there were 160 school resource officers in Broward County that served 187 schools. That said, Department of Education spokeswoman Audrey Walden said the report does not necessarily capture every single school resource officer in the district. Many districts have agreements with local law enforcement agencies that allow them to have additional school resource officers funded through other sources not captured by the report. (Each school district receives a minimum of $62,660 through the safe schools appropriation.) In other words, there might be more than 1,500 school resource officers in the state. "This report might not capture the officers funded through other sources, so we do not have an official statewide total," she said. We checked other sources for a more comprehensive total of school resource officers and came up empty-handed. So while the 1,500-figure might not be reflective of every single resource officer in the state, it's the only data we could find. Counting schoools We asked Galvano’s office about the discrepancy in the report’s count of Florida schools (2,432) versus Galvano’s (3,800). Senate spokeswoman Katie Betta said that to arrive at the 3,800 number for schools, legislative staff counted up state data for elementary, middle and high schools, alternative schools, Exceptional Student Education centers and charter schools. More than 4,000 schools fall under that count, so the staff excluded adult high schools, hospital homebound students, virtual school students, and Florida Department of Juvenile Justice facilities, to get to 3,800. But the state report found about 1,500 officers serving 2,400 elementary, middle, high, alternative and "combination" schools. Galvano took a specific count for 1,500 school resource officers and applied it to a larger number of schools than what the report actually reflects. The shortage in school resource officers reflects a broader shortage of law enforcement officers in the state, said Commander Dale Tharp of the Escambia County Sheriff's Office, who is also the spokesman for the Florida Association of School Resource Officers. He said most large law enforcement agencies are short 40 to 50 officers. Other counties have already started the process of getting more resource officers into schools without waiting for the state. Both Manatee and Hernando counties added resource officers to their schools in the weeks following the shooting. Our ruling Galvano said Florida has "roughly 1,500 resource officers dealing with about 3,800 schools." A Florida Department of Education report found that there were 1,517 resource and law enforcement officers that served a total of 2,432 schools in the 2015-16 school year. However, that report does not include every school resource officer in the state. Galvano arrived at his 3,800 figure by taking the overall number of schools and excluding a handful of non-traditional schools. But as the report states, those 1,500 officers served 2,400 schools. Galvano’s larger point — that many schools lack school resource officers — appears to be on point. But his numbers are off, so we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02169	Says Georgia Democratic Senate hopeful Michelle Nunn supports higher taxes.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/30/ending-spending-action-fund/group-attacks-michelle-nunn-tax-position/	Michelle Nunn has been frequently described as the Georgia Democratic Party’s best chance in a decade to capture a U.S. Senate seat, but many voters don’t know much about her positions on a range of important issues. One group recently decided to educate Georgians about Nunn in a television ad, making a claim about her that PolitiFact Georgia thought should be measured on the Truth-O-Meter. "Michelle Nunn wants to be your senator," a male voice in the ad says. "She supports Obamacare and higher taxes." The 30-second ad continues with the narrator saying that you may pay a penalty if the Internal Revenue Service does not like your health insurance plan. "Michelle Nunn, the last thing Georgia taxpayers need," the narrator says at the end of the ad. Nunn’s campaign website, though, disputes the ad’s claim about her support of tax increases. "(Tax) Reform shouldn’t raise taxes," it says. So, is the ad correct? The ad was paid for by a group called the Ending Spending Action Fund. Nunn has said she supports some components of the federal health care law, which many call Obamacare, and she wants changes made to other portions of the law. We hadn’t heard much from Nunn concerning her positions on taxes, so we decided to do some checking into the veracity of the organization’s claim. The Ending Spending Action Fund describes itself as "an independent organization that proudly supports candidates regardless of party affiliation who favor enhancing free enterprise, reducing the size of government, and balancing our nation's budget." Indeed, the fund seems to be a bipartisan critic. The group has also funded ads criticizing another U.S. Senate candidate from Georgia, Phil Gingrey, a Republican currently serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. It was founded in 2010 under another name by Joe Ricketts, a businessman who founded TD Ameritrade and whose family owns the Chicago Cubs baseball club, according to Open Secrets, a website that tracks money in politics. Ricketts has said he is a registered independent. The fund is based in Tampa, Fla. After several calls and email exchanges over the course of two weeks, the fund’s president and general counsel, Brian Baker, sent us a six-page report outlining its argument that the ad is correct that Nunn supports higher taxes. Its case on income taxes includes: Past interviews in which Nunn said "we need to be willing to put both spending and revenues on the table" to reduce the federal debt. It points to PolitiFact articles where our colleagues have written that raising revenue is a tax increase. Information from Nunn’s campaign website where she talked about closing tax loopholes on businesses. Nunn’s support for the federal health care law. We decided to break down the group’s argument by categories -- the tax code and the health care law. First, the tax code. Nunn campaign officials counter that she wants changes to the tax code that would be revenue-neutral, which they say meets the definition of prominent conservative tax groups such as Americans for Tax Reform of what is not a tax increase. In 2011, when the Georgia Legislature passed a tax package, Americans for Tax Reform supported the plan because it was revenue-neutral. Americans for Tax Reform asks candidates for federal office to sign a pledge that they will oppose any effort to increase the marginal tax rate on individuals and businesses as well as oppose any net deduction or elimination of deductions unless it is equally matched by a reduction in tax rates. Nunn’s campaign website lays out several initiatives that lower taxes for individuals and businesses. Her positions include: Lowering the federal corporate tax rate, although it does not specify what the rate should be. Simplifying the tax code to make it easier for taxpayers to claim tax credits. Increasing the startup deduction for businesses to $10,000. Extending tax credits for research and development. Now, on to the health care law. The health care law requires most uninsured Americans to buy health insurance. Individuals who don’t comply with the law face a tax penalty of at least $95 when they file their taxes next year. There are other taxes that raise revenue that are associated with the law. In its decision to uphold the individual mandate, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the penalty was basically a tax that Congress was imposing on people who failed to buy insurance. The contentious decision allowed President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement to survive a constitutional battle. There’s still plenty of debate on whether that penalty is a tax or just analogous to one. Nunn has said she supports the health care law but believes some elements of it need to be tweaked. Nunn campaign spokesman Nathan Click questioned the logic of using Nunn’s support of the health care law to conclude that she supports raising taxes since the health care law has already taken effect. To recap, the Ending Spending Action Fund put together an ad claiming Nunn supports raising taxes. It based that claim on prior interviews in which the candidate has said she would be willing to put revenue on the table to reduce the federal government’s debt and because of her general support of the federal health care law. Nunn’s positions on these issues, though, are more nuanced. Nunn has said several times she favors a revenue-neutral approach, which her campaign notes is a position some major conservative groups say is not a tax increase. Nunn wants to fix some elements of the health care law. Her campaign also says it’s odd to say Nunn supports raising taxes because Obamacare is already a policy that is the law, although the Republicans running for the Senate seat want to repeal the law. We believe the statement in the ad about Nunn oversimplifies her position and needs a lot of context. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05928	"We wiped out a $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/29/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-eliminated-wisconsins-36-/	In a new campaign ad in heavy rotation on a television near you, Gov. Scott Walker looks directly into the camera to repeat the heart of his message as a potential recall election looms. "When I ran for governor, I promised to rein in spending, eliminate the deficit and hold the line on taxes. And you know what? That’s exactly what we did. We had to make some tough decisions, but thankfully, we wiped out a $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes." Walker makes frequent use of that last phrase -- "we wiped out a $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes" -- and did so again on Jan. 25, 2012 in his ’state of the state’ address. Between the Walk-O-Meter (the tax question) and the Truth-O-Meter (deficit-related items) we’ve looked at aspects of this claim. But we haven’t looked at how Walker is intertwining the two in his new anti-recall push. And it’s our most-frequently requested item of late from readers, mainly because of a new twist: Walker’s own administration recently told the federal government the state will be left with a deficit at the end of the two-year budget. So which is it? Did Walker eliminate the deficit -- and do so without raising taxes -- or not? On the deficit question, the answer is in the accounting. Stay with us. It will be painless. Let’s start with the bottom line: The state constitution requires a balanced budget and it has -- under Democrats and Republicans alike -- long used what is known as a cash accounting system in its budgeting. That approach is used to generate the deficit number that politicians, the media, budget officials and others generally talk about. It was the basis for Walker to say in spring 2011 he faced an estimated $3.6 billion shortfall while putting together his first budget. (Critics argued he exaggerated the number, but a major deficit was real.) But there is another way to look at the state’s books, a more stringent measure and one Walker himself cited in his bid to succeed Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. In the 2010 race, Walker made an explicit promise, noted on his campaign website to "require the use of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to balance every state budget, just as we require every local government and school district to do." This is known as the accrual accounting method, something also used by publicly traded companies. On the Walk-O-Meter, we rated this a Promise Broken. Walker did not use the GAAP approach on his first budget. Indeed, under that approach, the state shows a $3 billion GAAP deficit each of the next two years. And that is the new source of confusion. It was the GAAP standard Walker pointed to on Dec. 29, 2011, when his administration argued to the federal government the state should be allowed to make further cuts to state health programs. Why? Well, that measure showed a deficit in the state budget. To be sure, Democrats didn’t complain about the broken promise at the time -- balancing the budget by the GAAP method would have required much deeper cuts. And even now, as they note Walker is trying to have it both ways, no one is suggesting the state reopen the budget and cut billions more. Why are the two numbers so different? The cash accounting method allows the state to use maneuvers to bring the budget into balance, such as pushing current liabilities into future budgets or counting anticipated revenue before it materializes. Think of the $2,000 you have on a credit card from buying a big-screen HDTV and sound system for the party room. GAAP takes that future liability into account now. "It’s sort of the difference between the federal debt and the federal deficit -- one is an accumulated figure over many years and the other is a one-year number," said Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research group. But the fact a GAAP deficit exists doesn’t wipe out what Walker and lawmakers did in balancing the budget according to the official, recognized method used by the state and its Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which both sides acknowledge as the official neutral scorekeeper of such matters. And it’s clear to us Walker in the new ad -- and in other venues -- is talking about the traditional cash shortfall deficit. He refers to choices he made during the budget process. And he refers to the $3.6 billion number, which was used frequently in early 2011 to describe the size of the budget shortfall. In 2011, we rated False separate statements by U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore and state Rep. Marc Pocan that Walker "manufactured" or "invented" the $3.6 billion shortfall. The number is squishy, outside experts told us, but a defensible estimate of the challenge he faced. So in the ad, Walker is on solid ground to say he eliminating a $3.6 billion deficit. This leaves us with the tax aspect of the claim. In an earlier Walk-O-Meter item we rated as Promise Broken Walker’s pledge to "oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." But in the ad, the claim is worded somewhat differently -- that the deficit was eliminated "without raising taxes." Overall, Walker’s budget included a modest $34 million reduction, mainly through business tax breaks. His plan included $83 million in tax cuts, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, but that was offset by $49 million in tax increases. The bureau determined that Walker included three tax increases in the budget. As we noted in our Walk-O-Meter item on the promise: "The largest involved a reduction in a state tax credit for low-income working families, known as the earned income credit. A tax credit reduces the amount of tax you owe. "In this case, the earned income tax credit is in place for both state and federal taxes. It’s refundable, so individuals with little or no income tax liability may still receive the credit. "A second tax increase, the fiscal bureau said, is stopping the inflationary adjustment of the state’s Homestead Tax Credit -- the property tax break that appears as a credit on income tax forms for low-income homeowners and renters. The bureau calculated that change would increase taxes by an estimated $8.1 million." Walker has disputed the characterization of the credit change as a tax increase, saying that decreasing a tax credit is reducing spending, not increasing taxes. But outside experts, including one with the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance and another with the Wisconsin Budget Project, told us they considered it a tax increase. And even though the language in Walker’s ad is somewhat different than his 2010 pledge, it still ignores those tax increases in his budget. The bottom line on Walker’s claim of eliminating a $3.6 billion deficit without raising taxes: It’s a mixed message. So is ours: Half True.

pomt-09858	The health care plan for members of Congress "is no better than the janitor who cleans their offices."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/11/barack-obama/obama-gets-right-federal-health-care-benefits/	During a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, 2009, an audience member asked President Barack Obama why members of Congress have a different health care plan than the rest of us. "Why have you not used the bully pulpit to chastise Congress for having two systems of health care, one for all of us and one for them," an audience member asked. Obama answered that lawmakers get a good deal on health care, but that "their deal is no better than the janitor that cleans their offices because they are part of a federal employee plan. It is a huge pool. You've got millions of people who are part of the pool which means they have enormous leverage with the insurance companies. ... That drives down their costs, and they get a better deal." Republican critics of the president's plan have made an issue of coverage for members of Congress, saying that lawmakers should be forced to take the public option, the most basic government-run plan under Obama's proposal. We found Newt Gingrich was largely correct that Democrats have voted against that idea. The administration has studied the federal benefits program, which gets high marks for efficiency, to get ideas for its own health care proposal. Obama's description of the federal plan is accurate. Under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, federal employees and elected officials can choose from an array of plans, ranging from very basic options that have high deductibles and only carry catastrophic coverage to more expensive coverage that is more comprehensive. It is the largest employer-sponsored program in the world, covering over 9 million employees, retirees, former employees, family members and former spouses, according to the Office of Personnel Management's Web site. People who opt for the same package will get the same treatment, said Michael Ornstein, a spokesman for the Office of Personnel Management. "The benefits, co-pays and deductibles are no different whether you are a career employee like myself or an elected official," he said. For the most part, janitorial staff on Capitol Hill are federal employees, said Eva Malecki, communications officer for the Architect of the Capitol, the office involved in the day-to-day operations of the Capitol complex. "We do have a few contract workers," she said. "But the majority are federal employees and are therefore covered by the federal employee benefits program. The custodial staff has access to the same benefits as members of Congress." We should note that while janitors and members of Congress can choose from the same menu of plans, members of Congress generally have more money to spend on, well, anything. Many members of Congress are millionaires. But Obama is right that lawmakers and janitors are eligible for the same benefits, deductibles and co-pays. We rate his statement True.

pomt-03110	Since 2007, "Texas has gained 440,000 people" while "Maryland has lost 20,000."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/20/newt-gingrich/martin-omalley-newt-gingrich-face-off/	EDITOR’S NOTE: We initially published our fact check of Gingrich’s comment on Sept. 20, 2013, with a rating of False. Soon after, CNN provided us with additional information. After we looked into their data, we rewrote and republished the story the same day, changing the rating to Half True. The original item has been archived here. A faceoff on CNN’s Crossfire between Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, and Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat, produced a robust debate over how best to promote a state’s economic growth and quality of life. It also produced a blizzard of statistics with varying degrees of accuracy. One of the disputes focused on the two states’ population growth, with co-host Newt Gingrich suggesting that Texas was growing and Maryland shrinking because of their economic performance. Here’s the exchange: O’Malley: "One of the key differences between our two states, Newt, is that our state was ranked among the top three in upward economic mobility. Texas was ranked among the worst states in terms of downward economic mobility." Gingrich: "Let me ask you this. As an objective fact, in the five years you've been governor, Texas has gained 440,000 people. According to the U.S. Census, Maryland has lost 20,000. Now, if we're having all this upward trajectory, why is Texas doing 22 times better in population migration over the last five years than Maryland?" O’Malley: "Actually, you need to check your facts. We've actually added 230,000 people. And we've actually grown by 4 percent. But that fact is dubiously put out by some blogs." Gingrich: "This is the U.S. Census." We turned to the source Gingrich cited: the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau not only counts the United States’ population every 10 years but also estimates population every year in between. We looked at the population estimates for the five-year period between 2007, the year O’Malley took office, and 2012, the most recent year available. Here’s the summary: Using these numbers, O’Malley is correct. Maryland didn’t lose 20,000 people in the past five years; as O’Malley correctly noted, Maryland gained just over 230,000 people during that period. O’Malley was also essentially correct about the percentage increase for Maryland -- 4.1 percent. Meanwhile, Texas didn’t gain 440,000 people over the past five years, as Gingrich had said. The Lone Star State actually gained many more -- upwards of 2.2 million new Texans over five years. However, Gingrich can also claim accuracy by looking at a different set of statistics. He can point to numbers for migration -- that is, the net change in people who moved into or out of a state from other states. This number, unlike the one O’Malley used, excludes births, deaths and foreign immigration. The Census figures show that between 2007 and 2012, Maryland has lost a net of 22,774 people. Over the same period, Texas has gained 423,273 people. That’s less than Gingrich had indicated, but all in all, it’s pretty close. Our ruling Gingrich said that since 2007, "Texas has gained 440,000 people" while "Maryland has lost 20,000." O’Malley countered that Maryland has added 230,000 people. Essentially, they’re both right -- they just used different measurements. O’Malley is right if you use overall population figures, while Gingrich is right if you look at migration from other states.

pomt-03204	The book Little Red Riding Hood is something "that’s been banned in America," but not assault weapons.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/27/moms-demand-action-gun-sense-america/moms-demand-action-says-little-red-riding-hood-has/	The image created by a pro-gun control group and widely shared on social media is designed to be provocative. Two youngsters sit in a children’s section of a library, one holding a fairy tale book and the other holding an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. The caption: "One child is holding something that's been banned in America to protect them. Guess which one." The ad was created by Grey Group, an international ad agency, on behalf of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Moms Demand Action was founded in the wake of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., by Shannon Watts, a 42-year-old Indiana mother who has worked as a communications executive. The group claims tens of thousands of members and more than 75 local chapters, and it has been active in organizing on gun policy through social media. A reader forwarded us the ad with the two children, asking us to take a closer look. We decided to check whether Little Red Riding Hood, the book held by the child, is something "that’s been banned in America," and whether assault weapons haven’t been. We will start by noting that Watts, who did not respond to a request from PolitiFact, acknowledges that the ads are designed to be provocative. She told Yahoo! earlier this year that the ad is "obviously meant to make a point and create discussion. The (National Rifle Association) has been very, very good at creating fear among their members that their rights are going to be taken away or somehow the government is going to turn against them. We're trying to create debate and discussion about the facts." Still, we don’t think being provocative exempts the ad from being scrutinized for accuracy. 'Little Red Riding Hood' The Little Red Riding Hood shown in the image has indeed been banned before. The version of the 17th century fairy tale was adapted by the late, Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator Trina Schart Hyman and was originally published in 1987. According to media accounts, the volume became a target because one image showed a bottle of wine in the girl’s basket, a detail that had been included in the original version of the fairy tale. An Associated Press article quoted Culver City, Calif., assistant superintendent for instruction Vera Jashni saying that the inclusion of wine in the book "gives the younger ones the wrong impression about alcohol. If they should refrain, why give them a story saying it's okay?'' Jashni told the AP that she was worried about lines in the book that said, "The grandmother drank some of the wine, and ... after a while, the grandmother felt quite strong and healthy, and began to clean up the mess that the wolf had left in the cottage.'' So the Moms Demand Action ad has a point that the Hyman edition of Little Red Riding Hood has been banned before. Still, it’s worth noting some additional context. For more background, we contacted the American Library Association, the leading authority for tracking books that have been banned or challenged by parents in schools and libraries across the United States. It turns out that the only recorded examples of Little Red Riding Hood being banned took place in 1990 -- 23 years ago -- and occurred in just two California school districts, Culver City and Empire Union. When we asked the Culver City school district if the ban is still in place, they said it has been reversed. The American Library Association recorded three additional cases involving the volume, in Florida’s Bradford, Clay and Levy counties in 1990 and 1991. (One of the complaints in Bradford was that the wolf was too scary.) In these cases, parents or teachers challenged the books but administrators took no action to ban them. Indeed, Little Red Riding Hood doesn’t appear on any of the library association’s lists of most frequently banned books. The list of frequently banned and challenged "classic" books includes The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee and The Color Purple by Alice Walker. Frequently banned kids’ books include the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling and the Captain Underpants series by Dav Pilkey. So while the ad has a point that one version of Little Red Riding Hood has been banned in the past, there’s no evidence of it being banned during the past 23 years, and there’s no evidence of any bans outside of two school districts. Assault weapons The ad also has a point that there is currently no national assault-weapon ban. Such a ban was in force from 1994 to 2004, but it expired, and opposition from gun-rights advocates has kept it from being revived by Congress. However, a fact that somewhat undercuts the ad’s stark contrast is that seven states do ban assault weapons -- California, Connecticut, Hawaii (assault pistols only), Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, plus the District of Columbia. Collectively, these states account for about 27 percent of the nation’s population. In other words, it’s inaccurate to suggest that assault weapons haven’t been banned anywhere in America. States also typically ban the sale of firearms to the elementary schoolers pictured in the ad. Of course, supporters of tighter gun laws note that state bans aren’t especially useful in the absence of a national law, since assault weapons can easily be carried across state borders. Our ruling Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America’s ad said that Little Red Riding Hood is something "that’s been banned in America," but assault weapons haven’t been. We understand what the ad is trying to do, but its black-and-white language obscures that the "bans" being compared are not so clear-cut. Little Red Riding Hood was banned only in two school districts and nearly a quarter century ago; many books have been banned much more recently, and much more frequently, than that. In the meantime, there’s no national assault-weapons ban, but more than a quarter of Americans live in states that have banned assault weapons. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11483	Says Delta offers a discount to Planned Parenthood.	false	/georgia/statements/2018/mar/02/michael-williams-georgia/georgia-senators-false-claim-about-delta-discount-/	Georgia state Sen. Michael Williams received some on-air fact-checking from CNN when he criticized Delta Air Lines for ending a discount partnership with the National Rifle Association while favoring "liberal-leaning organizations" such as Planned Parenthood. Delta ended a discount agreement with the NRA in order to remain "neutral" in the national debate over gun control, which resurfaced after a Feb. 14 mass shooting in Florida. "If they're going to pull the discount for NRA members, why not pull it for Planned Parenthood or some of the left organizations out there?" Williams, R-Cumming, claimed during a Feb. 27 interview with CNN’s Brianna Keilar. Keilar asked for his source of information to back up Delta discounts for Planned Parenthood. Williams said he and other state senators "looked it up on Google." "Just to be clear, no, we looked it up as well. And it doesn't appear, after some digging, that we have been able to determine that that is actually factual, because you're indicating something that may not be true there," Keilar responded. Williams, who’s running to become Georgia’s governor, said he "very firmly" believed that Delta "is out there giving discounts to left-leaning organizations as well." "But if you're making that argument," Keilar said, "shouldn't you have your facts straight?" Like CNN, PolitiFact Georgia found no evidence to support Williams’ claim. Williams’ campaign did not provide evidence to prove it, and Planned Parenthood told us there are no perks, discounts or deals that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member — whether with Delta or any other company. "There are no corporate perks that come with being a Planned Parenthood supporter or member," said Erica Sackin, director of political communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund. Delta did not respond to our query. Williams’ evidence is a missed connection Williams and Keilar’s debate continued off-air on Twitter: Keilar asked for backup on the Planned Parenthood claim. Williams tweeted back that his team had responded. Keilar said his statement still did not back up his "bogus claim." Williams ultimately tweeted a statement saying Keilar was pushing a "false narrative." Williams’ statement mentioned "Delta's history of supporting left-wing organizations that donate to abortion provider Planned Parenthood." That’s a few steps removed from what he said in the interview about Planned Parenthood receiving the discount itself. Williams started to backtrack from that in the Keilar interview. Here’s a transcript of the original exchange on CNN: Williams: "You're telling me that Delta … is not giving away discounts to left-leaning organizations? Is that what you're telling me?" Keilar: "No, you told me that it was Planned Parenthood. I'm just talking to you about what you said to me." Williams: "I know, but is that not a left-wing organization? ... It is a very left-leaning organization." Keilar: "There's no indication they are giving discounts to that organization, is my point." Williams: "Again, let's, I guess, agree to disagree, because, again, we cannot -- bring me back on and I will have the information for you about where they're giving away these discounts to (a) left-leaning organization that support(s) Planned Parenthood." So in addition to Williams saying Delta gives discounts to Planned Parenthood, he backs it up to say Delta has ties with left-leaning groups that in turn support Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions. That doesn’t check out either. Faulty Komen link Williams’ spin that Delta has ties to the Susan. G. Komen Foundation, which supports Planned Parenthood, is also wrong. "A quick Google search reveals Planned Parenthood receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from Delta partner Susan G. Komen," Williams said in his printed statement. "It's as simple as that. Has Delta cut their ties with the Susan G. Komen Foundation like they did the NRA?" Andrea Rader, spokeswoman for the breast cancer research organization Susan G. Komen, told PolitiFact Georgia, "Komen does not and has not had a partnership with Delta at either the state or national level." Komen does have seven grants in local markets to Planned Parenthood, totaling $277,000, for breast exam services, Rader said. Williams may have conflated Susan G. Komen with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, an actual Delta partner. The Breast Cancer Research Foundation told PolitiFact Georgia it does not give money to Planned Parenthood. Greg Bluestein, a political reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, tweeted to Williams that Komen said his claim about a Delta partnership is incorrect. Williams tweeted back, "They may want to issue a new statement" and included a link to a website for Flashpoint Agency, billed as a marketing agency. Flashpoint Agency’ page has photos of a white and pink plane with a pink ribbon that appears to be Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s logo. "As part of Delta’s work with the Susan G Komen Foundation Flashpoint was brought in to help launch the ‘Pink Plane’ for Breast Cancer Awareness," the website said, incorrectly identifying the partnership. We found a Reddit post where a user wrote "Delta ends NRA discounts. Keeps relationship with Planned Parenthood." The user included a screenshot of a Twitter exchange asking Delta, "Did you end your discount for Planned Parenthood?" The Delta Twitter account responded, "Hey Stuart. We don't handle this over Twitter however I will send you the link below where you could find further information. http://bit.ly/2CRW68T Have a fabulous day. *TLJ" (Delta sent the user a broken link, which the user noted in a reply.) We asked Delta if it offered discounts to Planned Parenthood but the airline did not respond to that specific question. Delta shared a memo from CEO Ed Bastian to Delta employees regarding the company’s NRA decision and subsequent action by Georgia lawmakers to remove a jet fuel tax exemption from a tax bill that could have saved Delta millions of dollars a year. "While Delta’s intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course," Bastian said.

pomt-06229	The St. Norbert College/Wisconsin Public Radio poll has "been wrong in almost every election."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/04/scott-walker/wis-gov-scott-walker-says-poll-repeatedly-wrong/	As Wisconsin Democrats geared up to begin the process of recalling Gov. Scott Walker, a public opinion survey released Nov. 15, 2011 contained some troubling results for the first-term Republican. The poll, conducted by St. Norbert College in De Pere and Wisconsin Public Radio, said 58 percent of respondents believe Walker should be recalled. That was an increase from 47 percent in an April poll conducted by the same partnership. When asked in a television interview about the results, Walker turned the tables and focused on the poll itself: "Literally, it's been wrong in almost every election," Walker said. "It's been completely off the mark. It's nowhere near any other poll that's been out there. I don't take any credence in that." The St. Norbert poll has been around since 1984 and its results receive wide coverage in the state media. This is the first instance we could find of someone publicly claiming it’s fundamentally a "bad" poll. When we asked Walker’s office to provide evidence of the governor’s claim, they sent us to state Republican Party spokesman Ben Sparks. He made two points: Polling sample: The result of the recent poll "is essentially worthless" because pollsters interviewed 426 adult residents and did not narrow the group to likely voters, he said. That reduces its accuracy, he said, because there’s no way of knowing whether or not these people participate in elections. Track record: In October 2010, the St. Norbert/WPR poll looked at the upcoming election for governor, pitting Walker against Democrat Tom Barrett. "That poll did not reflect the election results within the margin of error," Sparks said. He offered no additional evidence about the poll’s accuracy in previous elections. We’ll start with a caveat: We’re examining Walker’s statement, not attempting to rate the St. Norbert poll against any others. It’s worth noting that since the St. Norbert poll generally uses a smaller sample than most, it will have a larger margin of error. On the question of who was polled, a separate poll conducted a few weeks earlier than St. Norbert’s poll shows how results can differ depending on the group targeted. Public Policy Polling reported Oct. 26, 2011 that state voters were evenly divided about recalling Walker. That poll had a far larger sample -- 1,170 -- than the St. Norbert poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. Another key difference is that Public Policy Polling interviewed likely voters; St. Norbert’s sample, as mentioned, came from all state adults. Sparks argued that made the poll "worthless." But his criticism is more an assessment of the poll’s predictive value, not whether it is accurate in terms of what it set out to measure. And it should be noted the pollsters did not hide who was sampled, or present its findings as representing likely voters. On the question of the poll’s track record, we turned to University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor Charles Franklin, founder of a website called Pollster.com. That site compiles and keeps track of all Wisconsin polls that are publicly available as well as national ones. Franklin said one measure of the accuracy of the St. Norbert poll was to look at the results of other polls conducted at about the same time. After all, polls are a snapshot -- not a prediction -- and influenced by advertising, debates and other developments in a campaign. So it makes sense to stick with the same time frame. Franklin looked at two polls conducted at the same time St. Norbert researchers were in the field. For the pre-election poll, St. Norbert researchers sought out likely voters (not all adults), as did the other two polls he reviewed. St. Norbert pollsters interviewed voters Oct. 12 to 15, 2010. Opinion Research Corp., working for CNN/Time, was in the field Oct. 8 to 12, and the Mellman Group, a firm that works for Democrats, conducted its interviews Oct. 18 to 20. Here are the results: St. Norbert: Walker 50, Barrett 41, Undecided 6, Other 2. The poll interviewed 402 likely voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent. Opinion Research: Walker 52, Barrett 44, Undecided 2, Other 2. The poll interviewed 931 likely voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent. Mellman Group: Walker 47, Barrett 45, Undecided 7. The poll interviewed 600 likely voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. The actual results of the Nov. 2 election: Walker 52.2 percent; Barrett 46.5 percent. So how did the St. Norbert poll do? Franklin said there are two ways to measure this, beyond the obvious fact that it got the winner right. The difference between the poll result and the actual outcome. St. Norbert had Walker leading Barrett 50 to 41. Walker actually got 52.2 and Barrett got 46.5. That’s .5 of a percentage point outside the poll’s 5 percentage point margin of error. The margin of victory. St. Norbert had Walker ahead by 9 and he won by 5.7 So it was off by 3.3 points. At the very worst they underestimated Barrett by 5.5 and Walker by 2.2, Franklin said. Franklin also looked at the results from the same St. Norbert poll for the U.S. Senate race between Republican Ron Johnson and Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold. The poll showed Johnson at 49 percent and Feingold at 47 percent. Johnson got 51.9 percent to Feingold's 47 percent, so a 2.9 error on the margin. Franklin’s conclusion: "At least in 2010, St. Norbert was right on both winners while over estimating the size of Walker's win and under estimating the size of Johnson's win by 3.3 and 2.9 points respectively. Those errors are both within the theoretical margin of error for the sample size they used." We asked St. Norbert Poll director David Wegge about the most recent poll. Why didn’t they interview likely voters? Wegge said the most recent poll surveyed 482 adults and was an effort to measure public opinion on a variety of topics, including general public policy matters and the effort to recall Walker. He said the pollsters were not trying to assess the outcome of an election, so they didn’t limit their sample to likely voters. Wegge, who founded the St. Norbert Survey Center (now called the Strategic Research Institute), said the organization does professional research for a variety of clients including the United Way, the Green Bay Packers, Affinity Health Systems and the Oneida Tribe. He noted the poll fared well in a 2010 blog by Nate Silver of the New York Times, who looked at the performance of 265 pre-election polls nationally. St. Norbert ranked 45th on that list, six places behind the far-better-known CBS/New York Times and in between polls run by the Kansas City Star and the Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times. Finally, we looked at the results of St. Norbert’s pre-election poll from a couple of other state-wide elections. Remember, Walker claimed the poll was "wrong in almost every election." Wegge said the same size and margin of error has been the same for years -- about 400 people and plus or minus 5 points. The pre-election polls always look at likely voters, he said. For the pre-election poll in the 2004 presidential race: St. Norbert had Democrat John Kerry at 48 (actual result, 50) President George Bush 43 (49) and undecided at 5 (none in the actual vote). The undecideds broke to Bush, and the poll was "right." For the 2002 gubernatorial election: Democrat Jim Doyle 41 (45) Republican Scott McCallum 33 (42), Independent Ed Thompson 6 (11) and undecided 17 (none.) That large group of undecided voters moved primarily to the losing candidates. Because of the undecideds, the poll was too low on McCallum -- outside the margin of error -- but it did get the winner and losers correct. So what result do we get? Walker dismissed a St. Norbert/WPR poll that showed 58 percent of state residents favored a recall as being consistently wrong. As evidence, the GOP criticized the pollsters for not quizzing likely voters. And they said the poll got the 2010 election wrong, but offered no evidence that the poll has been "consistently wrong." In it’s most recent poll, St. Norbert wasn’t trying to predict an election outcome. It was looking at whether the general public favored a recall. Secondly, GOP spokesman Sparks and Walker were wrong about the poll when it came to the 2010 results. The poll got that race right. And there’s no evidence that the poll has been consistently wrong in the past. We rate Walker’s claim False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-12-04T09:00:00	2011-11-16	['None']

pomt-06359	Says if elected, he would be the first Mayor who lives east of 82nd.	true	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/04/jefferson-smith/if-elected-would-jefferson-smith-really-be-first-p/	In his bid to be Portland’s next mayor, Jefferson Smith has taken a decidedly populist tack, stressing, among other things, his connection to east Portland. "Portland needs to finally meet its promises to struggling people – to communities of color, folks east of 82nd, and families being priced out of their neighborhoods," he says on his campaign website. "Portlanders need a government that looks out for their needs – no matter where they live." In a recent press release he took up the theme again, this time announcing that if elected, he’d "be the first Mayor who lives east of 82nd." It’s a claim made to symbolize his understanding of under-served communities -- and a fact that seems to be begging for a check. First, we needed a little history lesson in terms of Portland’s boundaries. Prior to the 1900s, Portland didn’t stretch east past the Willamette River, according to a map of city annexations from the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability. In the early 1900s, the city started edging east slowly, and by the 1980s, Portland began growing past 82nd Avenue in earnest. That is all to say that there’s not much sense in going back any further than Terry Schrunk, who served as mayor from 1957 until 1973. The area east of 82nd wasn’t part of Portland until shortly after his tenure. We called up Smith’s campaign to see if it could back up its claim. Campaign workers called back with a list of general areas in which the current mayor and his most recent seven predecessors lived (that goes back to Schrunk). According to their list, they were right. Of course, we wouldn’t be worth much if we just took people at their word. So, we took their list and went to the City of Portland Archives and Records Center. There, we went mayor by mayor and -- thanks to the staff there -- were able to get a reliable address for each of the pertinent mayors: Schrunk, according to the city’s 1972 Annual Financial Report, lived at 5407 N. Houghton St. Neil Goldschmidt, who served from 1973 until 1979, lived at 4011 N.E. 23rd Avenue, according to the city’s 1975 Annual Financial Report. Connie McCready, who served from 1979 until 1981, lived at 2407 N.E. 27th Avenue. This was the address listed in the two reports cited above, during which time she was a commissioner, as well as in the 1979 Portland Directory. Frank Ivancie, who served from 1981 to 1985, lived at 2732 N.E. Thompson St. This was the address reported in the financial reports and backed up by the 1980-81 Portland Directory. Bud Clark, mayor from 1985 to 1993, lived at 2522 N.W. Northrup St., according to the 1985 Portland Directory. Vera Katz, 1993 until 2005, lived at 2068 N.W. Johnson St., according to Statements of Organization the city has from when she filed to run, both in 1996 and in 2002. Tom Potter, who served from 2005 until 2009, lived and still lives on Southeast 41st Avenue, according to a Summary Statement of Contributions and Expenditures he filed in December 2004. And Sam Adams, our current mayor, lives on North McClellan Street, according to voting and assessor records. Smith, for his part, lives east of Interstate 205 on Northeast Pacific Street, according to voting and campaign records. All of this is to say that Smith was right on. If Portlanders select him as their next mayor, he’ll be the first to reside east of 82nd Avenue. We give this claim a True. Return to OregonLive to comment on this PolitiFact ruling.

pomt-10391	"In just a few years in office, Sen. Obama has accumulated the most liberal voting record in the Senate."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/16/john-mccain/obama-not-no-1-in-other-ratings/	Using a well-proven strategy from the Republican playbook, Sen. John McCain has been asserting that Sen. Barack Obama is a liberal. "In just a few years in office, Sen. Obama has accumulated the most liberal voting record in the Senate," McCain said in a speech in New Orleans. Republican candidates often brand their Democratic opponents as liberals to portray them as lefties who favor big government and high taxes. Linguists who study political rhetoric say Republicans have been so effective at giving the word a negative connotation that many Democrats won't call themselves liberals. They prefer "progressives." Still, many political scientists and journalists use the term to represent the Democratic extreme of the political spectrum, and National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine, uses a liberal-conservative scale for its annual rating of congressional votes. The magazine's editors and reporters choose key votes on major issues and those that they believe exhibit a split between liberals and conservatives and then calculate how often senators and House members vote each way. They calculate the liberal/conservative votes in three areas — economic, social issues and foreign policy — and then average them for a composite score. The annual rankings generate some publicity for the magazine, especially in election years. In 2004, the magazine said the most liberal senator was Sen. John Kerry, who became the Democratic nominee for president. On Jan. 31, 2008, five days before the Super Tuesday primaries, National Journal published an article headlined "Obama: Most Liberal Senator in 2007." The article said Obama had missed 33 of the 99 votes that were rated but that it was enough for a calculation. The magazine said McCain was not rated because he missed more than half the votes in the economic and foreign-policy categories. Since Obama's rating was announced, McCain and other Republicans have frequently cited it to criticize Obama. Rep. Dan Boren, a Democrat from Oklahoma, cited the rating last week in explaining why he was not supporting Obama. Yet other ratings don't show Obama as the Senate's top lefty. He wasn't the top liberal in his two other years in the U.S. Senate according to National Journal . He was 10th-most liberal in 2006 and 16th in 2005. The McCain campaign also cites a 2006 rating by the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action that gave Obama 95 percent, which the campaign noted was the same as Kerry and Sen. Barbara Boxer. But there's a little sleight of hand in that one. Although the McCain campaign is correct that Obama earned a 95 percent rating that year for voting the way ADA wanted, there were 10 senators who got more liberal scores than Obama, including Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Richard Durbin of Illinois. (In the latest ADA rating, for 2007, Obama missed five of the 20 votes the group scored, so he received a 75 percent rating. But he voted the way ADA wanted on each of the 15 votes he attended.) Voteview.com, a site created by political scientists that plots lawmakers on a liberal-conservative scale based on their voting patterns, calculated there were nine senators more liberal than Obama in the current Congress, including Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "Obama is a liberal, but he's not the most liberal," said Keith Poole, a University of California-San Diego professor who runs the site. Ratings from Congressional Quarterly don't measure liberal/conservative votes, but they show Obama is not quite as partisan as other senators. In CQ's calculation of party unity, which measures how often members vote with their party on bills where Republicans and Democrats split, Obama got a 97 percent rating last year. Ten Democrats had higher scores. On votes where President Bush indicated his position, CQ found Obama supported the Republican president 40 percent of the time in 2007, which put Obama in the middle of the pack for Democrats. He supported Bush 49 percent the previous year. If McCain had made a more general statement about Obama's ideology, he could have been more accurate. But McCain's statement that Obama "has accumulated the most liberal voting record" suggests it is a cumulative rating for all of Obama's time in the Senate. But in fact, it is true for only one rating for one year. Measurements for other years and by other groups show Obama is not the No. 1 liberal — in some cases, far from No. 1. So we find McCain's statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01878	Says he "voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/09/tom-cotton/rep-tom-cotton-defends-his-voting-record-disaster-/	Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. -- engaged in a tough and high-profile Senate race against incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor -- is fighting back against Democratic efforts to paint him as unsupportive of disaster relief funding, which is a potentially damaging issue for a state located in Tornado Alley. Last week, we looked at a Senate Majority PAC ad that claimed that Cotton "is the only Arkansan in Congress -- Democrat or Republican -- to vote against disaster relief five times." We rated that claim Half True, noting that Cotton had indeed voted against disaster relief spending five times, but that he had also voted for disaster relief funding as long as there were spending cuts to other programs to make up for it. Pryor has continued to highlight that aspect of Cotton’s record, but Cotton is fighting back in a new ad that features Faulkner County Sheriff Andy Shock walking around a storm-ravaged area. "Despite what you’ve been told, Tom Cotton stood with us every step of the way," Shock says in the ad. "Tom voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA. Sen. Pryor, start focusing on the real issues. Leave our community and our tragedy out of your campaign." A tornado hit Faulkner County this past April, killing 16. It was the last time the federal government declared a disaster in Arkansas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has spent about $5 million on disaster relief there, without having to seek congressional approval. Cotton’s ad mentions three occasions when he voted for disaster-relief funding -- votes that we missed in our first report. (Cotton’s campaign did not respond to our questions for the previous fact-check, nor for this one.) Here are the votes: • H.R. 2217, Department of Homeland Security Appropriations, vote #211, June 2013. This bill would have appropriated annual funding for the Department of Homeland Security, where FEMA gets its funding. It passed the House, 245-182, but died in the Senate. • H.J. Res. 85: 2014 FEMA Continuing Appropriations, vote #522, October 2013. The bill would have appropriated funding for FEMA. It passed the House, 247-164, but died in the Senate. • H.R. 2775 Continuing Appropriations, vote #550, October 2013. The bill continued appropriations through January 2014, ending the government shutdown. It passed the House and Senate and became law. We confirmed that Cotton did vote "yes" on all three of these bills, so these provide a measure of support for his claim. But it’s important to add some more context. For starters, we should note that all three votes happened before the April tornadoes, and they were not direct funding to Arkansas disaster relief. In addition, second and third bills above came during the government shutdown in October 2013, when Cotton sided with other tea party lawmakers in refusing to pass a broad spending bill unless Democrats agreed to repeal, defund or delay the Affordable Care Act. President Barack Obama refused to sign any bill with such a provision. FEMA became something of a political football during the shutdown, with Obama using the agency’s headquarters as a backdrop when making a plea for lawmakers to end their budget standoff. At the time, Hurricane Karen was heading toward Florida’s Gulf Coast, and many members of the FEMA staff were furloughed or had to work without pay. The second bill above -- the FEMA appropriations bill -- was one of numerous measures that would have funded individual (and popular) parts of the government temporarily, rather than the broad spending bill Obama was seeking. Obama made clear that the mini-spending bill gambit was dead on arrival, so observers never considered it a serious legislative effort. Even if Cotton can cite at least two and possibly three examples in which he "voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA," the ad ignores the five votes cited in our previous report in which Cotton voted against providing emergency relief funding. Our ruling A Cotton for Senate ad said, "Tom voted for disaster relief and full funding of FEMA." At least two of the votes Cotton’s ad cites, and possibly all three, show support for providing funding for disaster relief.

pomt-05865	Says "as of November, we were ranked 45th in the nation in terms of job creation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/10/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-new-jersey-ranked-45th-nation/	State Sen. Barbara Buono isn’t buying Gov. Chris Christie’s claim about a "Jersey Comeback." Instead, a dismal record of job creation in New Jersey suggests that "the American Dream may be slipping out of grasp for many families," the Middlesex County Democrat wrote in a Jan. 25 column posted on her website. "In New Jersey, our unemployment rate still remains above the national average and, as of November, we were ranked 45th in the nation in terms of job creation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics," Buono continued. "This is not to say Chris Christie is responsible for all of these woes, but his silence on the issue underscores his indifference (to) the plight of middle class New Jerseyans." PolitiFact New Jersey recently ruled, in part, on a similar claim regarding unemployment rates. So we decided to focus on Buono’s claim that "as of November, we were ranked 45th in the nation in terms of job creation." But when we compared New Jersey to the other 49 states and Washington, D.C. for job growth during recent time periods, the Garden State is performing better than what Buono claimed. Let’s start with the employment picture in New Jersey in November 2011. That month, there were 3,880,700 total nonfarm jobs in New Jersey, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those jobs represent private- and public-sector employment. To back up the senator’s claim, one of her representatives sent us federal labor statistics that demonstrate how the state ranked 43 out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. for the percentage of jobs created between November 2009 and November 2011. But that still doesn’t support Buono’s claim about the 45th ranking. Buono spokeswoman Christina Zuk told us in an email: "Bear in mind that the November data may have been adjusted, accounting for the 2% differential. We have no way of calculating what the rank was with the unadjusted data that are no longer available." But we told Zuk that the updated figures for November 2011 were available at the time Buono made her statement. To get a sense of how New Jersey’s growth compares during a more recent time frame, we also looked at jobs created between November 2010 and November 2011. A year-over-year comparison is a common measure of employment changes. With a 0.7 percent increase in jobs, New Jersey ranked 32 for growth between November 2010 and November 2011. Since the rankings differ significantly between the one-year and two-year periods, we were wondering which was a better measure of job growth. Three economic experts told us either time frame is appropriate. "There's no question that a year over year comparison is very common, and credible time frame to evaluate employment trends," Doug Hall, director of the Economic Analysis and Research Network at the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said in an email. Hall added: "In this case, however, I think November 2009 gives us something valuable, since it's more or less the time period since the national ‘recovery’ began." Edward Montgomery, an economist and dean of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute, agreed that both time frames are acceptable. Montgomery has held various federal government positions under President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton. "It is not ‘wrong’ to look at job growth over intervals of 1 month, 6, months, a year, or even some other interval (e.g. 2 years)," Montgomery said in an email. "That said, it is more ‘usual’ to look at an interval that has some easy meaning or relevance like in the past year (nov 2010 to nov 2011) or over the last decade or since the President took office etc." Since Buono framed her column as a critique of the governor’s ‘comeback’ theme, we also analyzed job growth since February 2010, Christie’s first full month in office. In terms of the percentage increase in jobs, New Jersey ranked 39 out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. for growth between February 2010 and November 2011. So, when you study more recent time periods, New Jersey is performing better than the 45th ranking cited by Buono. Our ruling In a column, Buono claimed that "as of November, we were ranked 45th in the nation in terms of job creation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics." Her representative sent us data showing that New Jersey ranked 43 for the percentage of jobs created between November 2009 and November 2011. But that still doesn’t support what the senator claimed. When you analyze growth between November 2010 and November 2011, New Jersey is doing better, ranking 32 for a 0.7 percent increase in jobs. Since the 43rd ranking for the two-year period comes close to the ranking in Buono’s column, we rate the statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01847	"We spend $18 billion a year on making sure that the federal government has immigrant enforcement agents. That's more than DEA and the ATF and the FBI and all the other enforcement (agencies) combined."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/15/luis-gutierrez/luis-gutierrez-says-us-spends-more-immigration-bor/	Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. -- a leader in the effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform -- says the United States is spending plenty of money on border enforcement. "We spend $18 billion a year on making sure that the federal government has immigrant enforcement agents," Gutierrez said. "That's more than DEA (the Drug Enforcement Administration) and the ATF (the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) and the FBI and all the other enforcements combined. But we still have a problem, right? So you can keep throwing money and talk about enforcement, enforcement, enforcement, but you've got to put money also into your judicial system, and you've got to put money in a comprehensive program that deals with the issue." Gutierrez made his comments on the July 13, 2014, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation discussing the surge of unaccompanied minors at the United States-Mexico border. We were surprised to hear him claim that the government spends more money on border and immigration enforcement than it does on all other federal law-enforcement agencies, including the FBI. So we took a closer look. When we asked Gutierrez’s office for a source, they pointed to a January 2013 report by the Migration Policy Institute tiled, "Immigration Enforcement in the United States: The Rise of a Formidable Machinery." The report found that spending in three federal-budget line items -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and US-VISIT, an automated tracking system for visitors to the United States -- totaled nearly $18 billion in fiscal year 2012. That was more than the $14.4 billion spent by other law-enforcement agencies that year. Those agencies were the FBI, the DEA, the ATF, the Secret Service and the U.S. Marshals Service. So, according to this report, spending on immigration enforcement did outpace other forms of federal law-enforcement in 2012. But that’s two-year-old data, so we decided to do an update. Here’s the rundown of enacted federal spending levels for fiscal year 2014. Some of these agencies are part of the Justice Department and some are part of the Department of Homeland Security. On the suggestion of experts, we’re using each agency’s appropriated budget -- that is, the part of their budget paid by taxpayers. This method ignores user fees paid by companies and others directly to the government for services. (US-VISIT is now known as the Office of Biometric Identity Management.) Agency Fiscal year 2014 enacted spending IMMIGRATION-RELATED Customs and Border Protection $10.7 billion Immigration and Customs Enforcement $5.3 billion Office of Biometric Identity Management $227 million Total $16.2 billion NON-IMMIGRATION RELATED FBI $8.2 billion Marshals Service $2.7 billion Drug Enforcement Administration $2 billion Secret Service $1.6 billion Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives $1.2 billion Total $15.7 billion So using the updated dollar amounts for 2014, Gutierrez is still correct. However, we wondered about whether other agencies should be included. We found one agency to add to the immigration side (Citizenship and Immigration Services at $135 million in appropriated funds) along with two agencies that could be added to the non-immigration side (the Transportation Security Administration at $4.9 billion in appropriated funds and the Coast Guard at $8.3 billion). When we asked the Migration Policy Institute why they hadn’t included the Coast Guard or TSA, spokeswoman Michelle Mittelstadt said that they were not included "because their missions are not primarily as federal criminal law enforcement agencies." She added that her group believes Gutierrez’s claim on Face the Nation is accurate. However, Gutierrez didn’t specify criminal law enforcement -- and without that distinction (or perhaps even with it) we don’t see a good reason to exclude TSA and at least a portion of the Coast Guard. Adding TSA alone changes the accuracy of Gutierrez’s claim. Adding in Citizenship and Immigration Services to the immigration side boosts the immigration total to $16.3 billion, while adding TSA to the non-immigration side would make the new total $20.6 billion. Adding the Coast Guard into the equation would likely make Gutierrez’s claim even more wrong, though allocating the Coast Guard’s budget between immigration and non-immigration duties is tricky. By law, the Coast Guard’s mission includes such areas as port, waterway, and coastal security; drug interdiction; migrant interdiction; and "other law enforcement." So a portion would likely end up on both the immigration and non-immigration sides of the equation. When we showed our calculations to Gutierrez’s office, Douglas Rivlin, the spokesman, said, "We were going from the report, which as far as we knew at the time was the best, most authoritative and most recent analysis available to us." Our ruling Gutierrez said, "We spend $18 billion a year on making sure that the federal government has immigrant enforcement agents. That's more than D.E.A. and the A.T.F. and the F.B.I. and all the other enforcement (agencies) combined." He’s correct under an agency classification system developed by the Migration Policy Institute. However, the institute’s calculations exclude the TSA and the Coast Guard. According to the group, these are not criminal-law enforcement agencies, but that seems like a fairly arbitrary distinction to us, and, more importantly, since Gutierrez didn’t make that distinction, we don’t see a good reason to exclude them. Adding in TSA by itself would make Gutierrez wrong. Because different approaches produce different results, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-15325	Says Florida had five sanctuary cities while Jeb Bush was governor.	false	/florida/statements/2015/jul/15/donald-trump/trump-says-florida-had-five-sanctuary-cities-when-/	Donald Trump criticized GOP primary rival Jeb Bush’s stance on immigration, implying the former governor allowed parts of Florida to shield illegal immigrants from federal laws while Bush was in office. "The polls just came out, and I'm tied with Jeb Bush. And I said, oh, that's too bad, how can I be tied with this guy? He's terrible. He's terrible. He's weak on immigration," Trump said during a speech in Phoenix on July 11, 2015. "You know, the sanctuary cities, do you know he had five of them in Florida while he was governor? Can you believe this? I didn't know that." Trump was practically tied with Bush according to a poll released the same day. But more importantly, Trump seized upon an increasingly used talking point in the presidential campaign -- so-called "sanctuary cities" that thwart federal immigration law. Bush’s stance on illegal immigration has wavered a bit over the years, but he was known for being in favor of deportation while in the Governor’s Mansion. Did five sanctuary cities exist in Florida during his time in office? Not according to any official metric, but the Internet is a big place. Sanctuary cities There is no specific legal definition of sanctuary cities, but it generally refers to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. The easiest sanctuary cities to identify are those with formal written policies. The recent shooting death of a San Francisco woman, allegedly by a Mexican native with a criminal record, has sparked a debate over rules like San Francisco’s quarter-century-old law declaring it a "city and county of refuge." The San Francisco law generally bans public employees from assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement with investigations or arrests unless required by a law or a warrant. There is an exception for people convicted of felonies. The term appears to have roots in the 1980s, when Central American refugees fled civil wars and were initially denied asylum. Religious institutions banded together to protect the refugees, with some cities expressing solidarity with the "Sanctuary Movement," according to a 2011 paper by the Immigration Policy Council. But before then, starting in the 1970s, some cities started policies banning police from asking about the immigration status of people who hadn’t been arrested. We reached out to Trump’s campaign and didn’t hear back; Bush’s people had no comment, either. So we went in search of lists of sanctuary cities. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service published a 2006 report listing 31 cities and counties that "will generally promote policies that ensure such aliens will not be turned over to federal authorities." No Florida cities were included. We also found websites that had put together their own lists, such as a 2007 list created by the Ohio Jobs and Justice PAC. Steve Salvi, the group’s founder, is critical of sanctuary cities and claims to have created the most comprehensive list of its kind. It was most recently updated in July 2015 and includes five Florida locations: DeLeon Springs; Deltona; Jupiter; Lake Worth, and Miami. Salvi told us that he culled the list by looking at news reports and input from local citizens. The requirements for the list are very loose -- cities could have provided services to illegal immigrants, or have leaders who promoted immigration reform. We found a few problems with the list. DeLeon Springs isn’t even a town, but part of unincorporated Volusia County. The county sheriff’s department oversees law enforcement there and in Deltona. The Deltona city attorney and the Volusia County Sheriff’s Department both said Deltona had never had such a policy since being incorporated in 1995. Officials in Jupiter and Lake Worth, which Salvi added to the list in 2009 (after Bush left office), said they aren’t sanctuary cities. Both cities have day-labor centers, which could be why they landed on the list. However, the existence of such centers for illegal immigrants to look for work doesn’t tell us anything about whether police cooperate with immigration authorities. Miami Mayor Tomás Regalado denies that his city is a sanctuary city, either now or when Bush was in office. "Do police enforce immigration? No, we never have. .... Officially, we don’t protect immigrants or deliver immigrants (to federal officials)," Regalado said. Current policies The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, regularly updates a map on its website detailing sanctuary cities, counties and states. It also lists why a location is included. As of this writing, the map listed seven Florida counties: Broward, Hernando, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, Pasco and Pinellas. The center told PolitiFact it based its map on U.S. Department of Homeland Security data from 2014 (years after Bush left office). Under a former program called Secure Communities, Immigration and Customs Enforcement got fingerprints from suspects, and if they had violated immigration laws, the agency asked local authorities to detain them. But some local officials complained that immigrants who were victims of crimes were avoiding the police, so the officials refused to comply with the ICE detainers. The federal agency announced a new more targeted program in November. In Florida, six of seven counties’ sheriff’s departments adopted policies in 2014 to no longer honor those "detainer" requests unless there is a legal order to do so. Miami-Dade County stopped complying with the requests a year earlier, in 2013. The Miami-Dade County Commission adopted the policy because the jail had to bear most of the detentions’ cost, and because immigration advocates clamored for the change. Now, arrested illegal immigrants are detained only if they have an outstanding warrant. What could Bush or any governor do to deter sanctuary cities? It seems like the Legislature would have had to have acted, and we didn’t find any action on the matter during Bush’s time. In 2008, after Bush left office, a bill that would have prevented sanctuary cities in Florida died in the Legislature, when Sen. Marco Rubio was then speaker of the House. The bill would have prohibited statewide any sort of government restrictions on disclosing someone’s immigration status in several scenarios, including employment or issuing public benefits. It also would have required all public employees to work with federal agencies to comply with federal immigration laws. Our ruling Trump said Florida had five sanctuary cities while Bush was governor. There’s no legal definition of a sanctuary city, and therefore no official classification. A federal report from 2006, when Bush was governor, didn’t name any Florida cities. We found one list on the Internet that claimed five Florida locations as current sanctuary cities, but the supporting evidence was virtually nonexistent. City officials told us they weren’t sure why their cities were on the list. For lack of evidence, we rate Trump’s statement False.

pomt-00769	Repealing Obamacare saves "our nation more than $2 trillion."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/apr/13/dave-brat/brat-says-obamacare-repeal-would-save-nation-2-tri/	U.S. Rep. Dave Brat is backing a federal budget plan recently proposed by his fellow House Republicans -- in no small part because it would end Obamacare. "This budget fulfills Republicans’’ pledge to voters to repeal Obamacare in its entirety -- including all of the tax increases, job-killing regulations and mandates -- saving our nation more than $2 trillion," Brat, R-7th, said in a written statement. He tweeted a similar message. We wondered whether the death of Obamacare -- formally known as the Affordable Care Act -- really would save the U.S. more than $2 trillion. Brian Gottstein, Brat’s director of communications, told us the figure -- which is cited in the GOP proposal -- came from a Jan. 26 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It estimated that mandatory federal spending provisions in the ACA would cost $2.03 trillion over the next 10 years. But an immediate problem arises from Brat’s use of the figure: The estimate was out of date when the congressman made his statement on March 17. Eight days earlier, the CBO issued a new report dropping the 10-year price tag to $1.75 trillion. The agency reduced its estimate because it concluded that spending on health care during the next 10 years will not be as high as previously predicted. As a result, the CBO said insurers are not expected to charge as much as once expected for health plans and the government will save on subsidies to cover low- and moderate-income families. Also, savings are being generated because fewer companies than expected are cancelling their insurance plans and fewer people, therefore, are turning to the ACA for coverage. All of this begs a question: Would Brat have been accurate if he had cited the latest CBO report and said repealing Obamacare would save the U.S. more than $1.7 trillion? The answer is no. The reason is that the ACA was set up to be self supporting, with a series of new taxes and health care efficiencies balancing the costs. Brat’s statement focuses on the expenses of Obamacare but ignores the revenue and saving sides of the program, which also would be wiped out by the repeal. The CBO examined the bottom line in 2012 at the request of House Speaker John Boehner, who wanted to know what effect abolishing Obamacare would have on the national debt. In such a case, the agency concluded, deficits would increase by $109 billion over 10 years. That figure has not been updated. The agency concluded that the ACA would more than pay for itself by generating almost $1.79 trillion in revenues and savings over 10 years. Of that amount: *$711 billion would come from efficiencies built into the ACA that would slow the projected growth in Medicare spending. The bulk of those savings would come from lower federal reimbursements to hospitals and reduced payments to Medicare Advantage -- an HMO program offered by private companies that contract with Medicare. These savings would disappear with the repeal of Obamacare. *Almost $1.08 trillion would come from an assortment of ACA taxes. Under Obamacare, for example, companies with at least 50 full-time employees face fines for not providing health coverage and so do individuals who can afford policies but don’t buy them. The ACA also increases payroll and capital gains taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000. Some might say that the repeal of Obamacare -- even if it doesn’t lower deficits --would at least save taxpayers more than $1 trillion in new levies. But this contention does not hold up under the Republican budget proposal that Brat endorses. That’s because the House plan, while abolishing the Obamacare taxes, counts their revenues in its long-term bottom line. In addition to ending ACA levies, the plan also calls for lowering individual, family and corporate income tax rates. House Republicans say they would completely fill the revenue holes by closing unidentified "special interest" tax loopholes. Our ruling Brat says the repeal of Obamacare, as envisioned in the House GOP budget proposal, would save "our nation more than $2 trillion." The congressman, an economist, gets his figure from an outdated CBO estimate of 10-year ACA costs. An updated analysis, published eight days before Brat’s statement, put the cost at $1.75 trillion. But there’s a much larger problem: Brat’s claim only deals with the expense side of Obamacare and ignores a series of built-in special taxes and health care efficiencies that the CBO has said more than enables the program to pay for itself. Brat describes the repeal of the ACA as the death of its mandates, regulations and "all of the the tax increases." The CBO has estimated such a repeal -- instead of saving the nation money -- would wind up increasing federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years. We rate Brat’s statement False.

pomt-09907	"We import more oil today than ever before."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/08/barack-obama/obamas-wrong-oil-imports/	In an interview with Novaya Gazeta , a Russian newspaper, President Barack Obama was asked what caused the economic crisis. Obama answered that oil imports were partly to blame. "Our economy did not fall into decline overnight," he said in the July 6, 2009, interview. "We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than ever before." Obama said the same thing on February 24, 2009, during his first address to Congress. At first, it sounded plausible to us that the United States would be importing more oil these days. But as our friends at FactCheck.org first pointed out , crude oil and petroleum imports have actually declined in recent years after peaking in 2005 and 2006. FactCheck cites the Energy Information Administration, a branch of government that keeps an enormous database of all things energy-related, and we confirmed it on the EIA's Web site. In two decades, imported oil will be down by about 20 percent, according to a March 2009 EIA report. And in April 2009, the American Petroleum Institute said that imports have fallen to their lowest levels in three years. The reason? "The big one is the decline in consumption," said Ron Planting, an economist with the API, a trade group representing oil and natural gas companies. "Our figures through May are that domestic consumption has declined 4.7 percent from a year ago." Through 2008, high gas prices spurred the decline, he said. Now, it's the recession. The proliferation of gasoline-ethanol blends and a 4.4 percent increase in domestic oil production have also contributed, Planting said. So Obama needs to check his figures. Twice this year, he has said that oil imports are higher than ever, but studies by the government and the energy industry show that's not true. As a result, we give Obama a False.

pomt-04717	Under the "Obama economy ... utility bills are higher."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-utility-prices-have-risen-under-b/	In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Mitt Romney sought to show how the economy has stumbled under President Barack Obama. "In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class," he said. "Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled." In this item, we’ll look at one of those claims -- that under the "Obama economy ... utility bills are higher." When we contacted the Romney campaign, a spokesman said Romney was referring to electricity prices. But in his speech he said "utilities," so we'll also examine other types, too. We found data for electricity, natural gas, home heating oil, propane, telephone services, and combined data for water, sewer and trash services. We looked specifically at prices for residential customers rather than commercial or other sectors. We also attempted, where possible, to compare the same months in 2009 and 2012, in order to eliminate any impact from cyclical or seasonal variations. We’ll take each type of utility in turn. Electricity The Energy Information Administration, the federal agency that tracks energy statistics, offers data on average retail prices for electricity residential customers in cents per kilowatt hour. In 2009, Obama’s first year, it was 11.51 cents, then rose in 2010 to 11.55 cents and again in 2011 to 11.80 cents. Through the first six months of 2012, it fell slightly to 11.79 cents. So overall, electricity is up by about 2.4 percent over the three-and-a-half year period, or less than 1 percent a year. On this score, Romney is correct. Natural gas Obama does better if you look at natural gas. The agency has data for the first five months of 2012, as well as monthly data stretching back for years before that. Specifically, the agency measures dollars per thousand cubic feet for residential customers. When you compare each of the five months in 2009 to its equivalent month in 2012, prices have dropped in every case. For instance, in January 2009, natural gas was $12.49; by January 2012, it was $9.55. And in May 2009, natural gas was $12.86, a price that by May 2012 had dropped to $12.19. So for natural gas, prices have consistently fallen under Obama, often by larger percentages than the rise in electricity. Home heating oil Data from the same agency shows that home heating oil was $2.42 per gallon during the week of Jan. 19, 2009, but rose to $3.94 by the week of Jan. 23, 2012. That’s a 62 percent increase over three years, or roughly 20 percent per year -- a big spike. Residential propane Agency data shows an increase for residential propane prices. For the week of Jan. 19, 2009, residential propane was $2.31 a gallon, a price that rose by the week of Jan. 23, 2012, to $2.86 a gallon. That’s a 24 percent increase, or about 8 percent a year. Water, sewer and trash collection The Consumer Price Index -- the government’s primary measurement of inflation -- calculates a combined measurement for water, sewer and trash collection. It’s an index, meaning that the raw numbers we report below don’t correspond to specific dollar amounts per unit but rather provide a way to compare the movements of prices over a given period of time. In July 2009, the index stood at 161.4. By July 2012, it rose to 189.8. That’s an increase of 18 percent, or 6 percent a year. Telephone services The Consumer Price Index also studies telephone prices. In July 2009, the index stood at 102.6 and fell by July 2012 to 101.6. That’s a decrease, though by less than 1 percent per year. Are the increases unique to Obama? Over time, utility prices consistently go up, according to George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. In fact, rising prices are more the rule than the exception. For example, we looked at how prices for each of these utilities moved during a three-year period of George W. Bush's presidency before Obama took office. We used the same data sources as we did above: Electricity: Up 11 percent from 2006 to 2009, or almost 4 percent per year. Natural gas: Down approximately 10 percent in each of the first five months of the year in 2006 and 2009, or a decline of a bit more than 3 percent a year. Home heating oil: Down by less than 1 percent between January 2006 and January 2009 Residential propane: Down about 15 percent between January 2006 and January 2009, or about 5 percent per year. Water, sewer and trash collection: Up about 18 percent between July 2006 and July 2009, or about 6 percent a year. Telephone services: Up about 7 percent between July 2006 and July 2009, or more than 2 percent per year. So under President George W. Bush, three of the six utilities we checked saw increases and three saw decreases – not radically different than the four increases and two decreases under Obama. In fact, for the one measurement the Romney campaign specifically cited when we asked -- electricity prices – rates rose at a significantly faster pace under Bush than they did under Obama. Assigning credit and blame Finally, when speakers make claims that seek to assign credit or blame for a particular statistic, PolitiFact typically looks at the question in two ways: Is the statistic right? And is the claim accurate in its assignment of credit or blame? As we’ve ruled in the past, presidential policies have some impact on the energy sector due to the government’s regulatory role. But the international marketplace and other factors play a role as well. Sinclair, the economist, agreed with that assessment. Our ruling Romney said that under the "Obama economy ... utility bills are higher." Under Obama, electricity, heating oil, propane and water-sewer-trash prices did rise, as Romney indicated. But natural gas and telephone prices fell. It's important to note the phenomenon is not unique to Obama. In the comparable three years of the Bush presidency, three of the six utility prices also rose. On balance, we rate Romney’s claim Half True.

pomt-00192	"I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/18/donald-trump/donald-trumps-claim-no-financial-interests-saudi-a/	As President Donald Trump faces criticism for passivity since the disappearance and suspected murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist, Trump has sought to downplay his personal financial dealings with Saudi Arabia. Trump has sent mixed messages in the roughly two weeks since Khashoggi vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. At one point Trump vowed "severe punishment" for those responsible. Yet he has also expressed reluctance at the possibility of jeopardizing the United States’ lucrative arms trade with Riyadh. Even as he’s highlighted the financial stakes underlying U.S.-Saudi relations, Trump has said he has no personal business ties to Saudi Arabia. "For the record, I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia (or Russia, for that matter)," Trump tweeted Oct. 16, after reports detailed his past commercial transactions with Saudi partners. "Any suggestion that I have is just more FAKE NEWS (of which there is plenty)!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Trump Organization also said in a statement that, "Like many global real estate companies, we have explored opportunities in many markets," but added, "we do not have any plans for expansion into Saudi Arabia." Trump’s recent comments present a sharp contrast with remarks he made on the 2016 campaign trail when he boasted about his financial ties to Saudi Arabia. "Saudi Arabia, I like the Saudis," Trump said at a July 2015 rally. "I make a lot of money with them. They buy all sorts of my stuff. All kinds of toys from Trump. They pay me millions and hundred of millions." We decided to take a closer look at transactions between Trump and Saudi business partners. We found no evidence that Trump or the Trump Organization owns property or invests in Saudi Arabia. However, Trump has profited from business dealings with Saudis dating back at least to the 1990s, and his hotels continue to generate revenue from Saudi interests. 45th floor of Trump World Tower In June 2001, Trump sold the entire 45th floor of Trump World Tower to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, according to multiple reports. The apartments, located near the United Nations headquarters, were later converted in 2008 into part of the Saudi Mission to the UN. The transaction earned Trump $4.5 million, according to the New York Daily News, citing a New York City Finance Department spokeswoman. The Daily News obtained documents showing the deal involved five apartments, which included 10 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms. In addition to the purchase price, the annual charges of more than $85,000 for building amenities — assuming they remained the same through the years — means "Trump was paid at least $5.7 million by the Saudi government since 2001," the Daily News wrote in a September 2016 article. Other reports say Trump pocketed as much as $12 million in the sale. That figure comes from the Associated Press, citing the brokerage site Streeteasy, which said Trump’s 2001 deal with the Saudis "was the biggest purchase in that building to that point." In his 2016 bid for the White House, Trump touted his real estate transactions with the Saudis. "Saudi Arabia — and I get along great with all of them. They buy apartments from me," Trump said at an Aug. 21, 2015, rally. "They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much." A yacht named ‘Princess’ Reports show that Trump has profited from deals with the Saudis since at least the early 1990s. According to the Associated Press, Trump was "teetering on personal bankruptcy and scrambling to raise cash" in 1991 when Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin-Talal agreed to buy Trump’s yacht. The 280-foot yacht, named "Princess," sold for $20 million, which according to the Associated Press, was a third less than what Trump is reported to have paid for it. In 1995, Prince Alwaleed was among a group of investors who paid $325 million for Trump's Plaza Hotel, which looks over Manhattan’s Central Park. According to the Associated Press, the hotel at the time of purchase was a money-losing venture. Saudi visitors to Trump hotels Even as president, Trump hotels continue to earn business from Saudi interests, reports show. Groups lobbying on behalf of the Saudi government spent $270,000 at Trump’s Washington hotel, according to a Washington Post investigation. The bill included some $190,000 for rooms, $78,000 spent on catering and $1,600 for parking, according to lobbyist filings. "The bill was ultimately paid by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia," the Post reported. A separate Washington Post investigation found that visits to Trump hotels by big-spending Saudis were responsible for a revenue bump. A letter obtained by the Post from the general manager of the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan said "a last-minute visit to New York by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia" had been a major factor in a 13 percent bump in revenue from room rentals for the first three months of 2018 — after two years of declining figures. The Post reported that while the Crown Prince did not personally stay at the hotel, accommodating his accompanying travelers for a five-day stay in March "was enough to boost the hotel’s revenue for the entire quarter." Emoluments Clause lawsuit In July, a federal judge in Maryland ruled that a lawsuit could proceed against Trump over his Washington hotel’s acceptance of payments from foreign governments. The suit alleges that by collecting such revenues — from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as other foreign governments — Trump is violating the Constitution’s foreign Emoluments Clause. The judge found that while Trump does not "actively manage" the Trump International Hotel, he "continues to own and purportedly controls" it, as well as the adjoining restaurant and event spaces, and "actually or potentially shares in the revenues." The accountability watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, is involved in the suit, which was brought by the District of Columbia and Maryland. A spokesman for CREW said Trump’s continued business dealings at Trump Hotel DC — less than a mile from the White House — represents a serious conflict of interest. "The problems — both ethical and Constitutional — with the president's businesses profiting off foreign governments like Saudi Arabia are in the profits themselves, not the physical location of the businesses," said CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz. Our ruling Trump said, "I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia." We found no evidence that Trump or the Trump Organization owns property in Saudi Arabia. However, Trump has profited handsomely from business dealings with Saudis dating back at least to the 1990s. Even during his presidency, Trump hotels continues to earn business from the Saudi government, reports show. In fact, Trump’s Washington hotel’s acceptance of payments from foreign governments — including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — is the basis on an ongoing lawsuit against Trump. We rate this Half True.

pomt-14542	"It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/feb/14/marco-rubio/rubio-exaggerates-sayig-its-been-80-years-lame-duc/	The death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was a key topic at the start of the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina Saturday night. Some of the candidates, including Sen. Marco Rubio, called on President Barack Obama to hold back on his replacement and leave the decision to the next president. "I do not believe the president should appoint someone," said Rubio, a Florida senator. "And it's not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice." Let’s see what history shows about lame-duck presidential picks to the Supreme Court. We emailed spokespersons for Rubio and did not hear back. Nominations Technically presidents don’t "appoint" a justice to the Supreme Court. They nominate someone who is then confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There’s also the problem of whether Obama should be considered a lame duck or not. Some would say Obama isn’t a lame duck until after Election Day in November when his successor is chosen. Others might say all second-term presidents are lame ducks because they know they won’t serve again. "The definition has evolved," said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Decades ago, the lame-duck label was applied to a president after an election, but the term has changed over time to include any officeholder in his or her last term. Either way, election-year Supreme Court nominations are rare. Rubio’s statement prompted several comments on Twitter from those who noted a specific exception to his claim: the nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy. The Senate confirmed Kennedy 97-0 on Feb. 4, 1988. That was about 28 years ago -- not 80. Kennedy replaced Justice Lewis Powell, who retired, and was Reagan’s third nomination for the opening, after Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg. Powell announced his retirement in June 1987. Reagan, who was in his second term, nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Kennedy was confirmed in February 1988. In November 1988, Reagan’s vice president George H.W. Bush won the presidency. "The nomination actually wasn't in the election year, although the confirmation vote was," said Harvard law professor Mark Tushnet. This came up minutes later in the debate, when U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, "We have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year." Debate moderator John Dickerson of CBS News corrected Cruz by noting that Kennedy was confirmed in 1988. We’re not certain which nomination Rubio was referring to 80 years ago. One possibility is when President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Nathan Cardozo to fill a vacancy in February 1932, and Cardozo was confirmed that same month. Hoover then went on to lose re-election later that year. "But Hoover was not a lame duck; he was eligible for re-election even though he lost," said Russell Wheeler, an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution and former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center. As of 2010, the Senate has rejected 16 of 34 Supreme Court nominations because of opposition to the nominating president, according to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report. Seven of the rejected nominations were put forward by presidents in their final year in office after a new president had been elected but before the successor took over. But those were more than 80 years ago. "Each of these ‘lame duck’ nominations transpired under 19th century presidents when the post-election period lasted from early November until early March," the report states. Our ruling Rubio said, "It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president appointed a Supreme Court justice." The most recent contradiction of this claim would be Reagan’s nomination of Kennedy. Kennedy was nominated in November 1987 and confirmed during Reagan’s final year of office in February 1988. Reagan’s timeline doesn’t exactly line up with what Obama faces; Reagan had more time between his nomination and the end of his presidency. But it’s hard for us to see how Obama can be considered a lame duck but not Reagan. Both were second-term presidents who knew they would not serve again but did not yet know who their successor would be.

pomt-14730	The Affordable Care Act is "making families pay double-digit premium increases."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/20/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-shaky-claim-obamacare-making-families-p/	House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., called out President Barack Obama as "one of the most polarizing presidents we’ve ever had," telling NBC’s Chuck Todd that relations between the parties would have been better under 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who made Ryan his running mate "But you guys are going to try to defund his signature health care law," Todd said on the Dec. 20 edition of Meet the Press. "For many progressives, that's a polarizing move." "It's a law that is not working. It's a law that's depriving people's choices," Ryan said. "It's a law that's making families pay double-digit premium increases." This sounded similar to a claim we examined in October, when GOP presidential candidate and businessman Donald Trump said the law is causing premiums to go up "35, 45, 55 percent." We rated that claim Half True, noting that some may see price hikes at those levels, but the rates suggested by Trump are the high end of premium changes. Ryan is suggesting less dramatic increases in the "double digits." We decided to rate that claim on the Truth-O-Meter. We found that Ryan, like Trump, is cherry-picking plans in the marketplace and ignoring the tax credits that are also part of the law. How prices have changed Most people get their insurance through their employer or other government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, not the federal exchange at healthcare.gov. (Single and family premiums for employer-sponsored plans increased an average of 4 percent this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading nonpartisan health policy research center.) In this fact-check, we’ll specifically look at health insurance plans sponsored by Obamacare. Ryan’s office sent us a few links describing how some Obamacare enrollees in some states will see increases of 10 percent or more from this year to next. But hikes in the double digits are not as universal as Ryan suggests, and not entirely attributable to the health care law itself. The Department of Health and Human Services looked at average rate hikes for the benchmark plan in the marketplace, the second-lowest priced silver plan. According to HHS data, 19 out of the 37 states in the federal exchange saw an average rate increase in the double digits. At the low end, rates in Missouri increased by 10.4 percent while Oklahoma saw the biggest hike at 35.7 percent. Conversely, four states actually saw reduced rates, with Indiana’s decrease in the double digits at 12.6 percent. The other 11 states with rate hikes saw smaller increases, from 1.2 to 6.1 percent. Across all silver plans, the average increase is about 11 percent, estimated McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm. But according to McKinsey, people who will see their lowest cost plans increase at rates above 10 percent are in the minority (28 percent). The national average increase for the benchmark plan, according to HHS, is not in the double digits. It’s 7.5 percent for the 37 states using healthcare.gov. In the 30 largest markets, representing about 60 percent of enrollees, the rate increase is 6.3 percent. "For most consumers, premium increases for 2016 are in the single digits and they will be able to find plans for less than $100 a month," said Kevin Counihan, CEO of healthcare.gov in a news release. Year-over-year average changes in premiums alone, however, don’t fully capture how changes hit an enrollee’s wallet. To get a sense of the typical rate increase, we have to also consider enrollment figures for each state, as well as tax credits for premiums, which are available to consumers earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line (less than $97,000 for a family of four). Factoring in these two components, the average rates are significantly reduced and nowhere near double-digit increases. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the weighted average rate for major cities in 49 states and Washington, D.C., grew by 3.6 percent. After accounting for tax credits, the weighted average actually decreased 0.7 percent. No such thing as typical Ryan missteps by saying the law alone is "making" the premiums increase. Rather, experts say, hikes are more likely the result of insurers underestimating how sick enrollees would be. "Risk pools remain quite volatile, at least in part because of all the special enrollment periods the administration has introduced in their attempts to get as many people as possible to sign up," said Gail Wilensky, a health economist and the head of Medicare and Medicaid under George H.W. Bush. "Stopping that is the first step to bringing stability to the market." But both Wilensky and Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Foundation stressed that 2016 is the first year that insurers are looking at actual claims data. Before, they were "essentially guessing at what their costs were," Levitt told PolitiFact in October. "Some insurers guessed better than others, which leads to variations in premium changes." Experts also stress that premiums vary too much to be captured by averages. Enrollment figures also differ from state to state, which influences each state’s risk pool and premium changes. Premium rate increases can also be unique to an individual’s circumstances. "A number of factors can result in a consumer’s premium differing from the average rate change, including changes in: age, tobacco status, geography, benefit design, family status, and subsidy eligibility," according to a brief by the American Academy of Actuaries. In other words, individual consumers may find national averages not all that telling when it comes to understanding their own rates. Our ruling Ryan said the health care law is "making families pay double-digit premium increases." Ryan has a point that some plans have seen increases of 10 percent or more with insurance purchased on healthcare.gov. However, Ryan is cherry-picking the high end of rate changes. On average, the benchmark plan has increased 7.5 percent, which decreases once premium tax credits and enrollment figures are factored in. We rate Ryan’s claim Half True.

pomt-11520	Says Melania Trump hired exorcist to "cleanse White House of Obama demons."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/19/yournewswirecom/fake-news-claims-melania-trump-hired-exorcist-clea/	Story that Melania Trump hired an exorcist to remove Obama’s demons from the White House is a hoax A hoax circulating on Facebook claims that first lady Melania Trump hired a professional exorcist to cleanse the White House of past demons from the Barack Obama and Bill Clinton years. "Melania Trump hired exorcist to ‘cleanse White House of Obama demons," read the headline on February 8 from Your News Wire. The story was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media’s efforts to combat fake news. Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Melania Trump, says any reports claiming the first lady had a ceremony to rid the White House of demons before moving in is false and "not true in any way." Your News Wire report originally appeared on Right Wing Watch, a blog dedicated to exposing the activities and rhetoric of extreme right-wing voices. A series of other websites reported variations of Trump’s supposed efforts to rid the White House of demons. The story opens by quoting Pastor Paul Begley of West Lafayette, Ind., saying Trump told him that she would not go into the White House unless it had been completely exorcised. However, there’s no record that the two ever personally corresponded, and in the podcast where Begley is speaking about this, he claims that is what Trump had told her husband, President Donald Trump. The White House is now "free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography" according to the article. Begley is quoted as saying that President Donald Trump allowed 40 pastors to come in to the White House seven times, anoint him with oil and lay their hands and pray on him. But, the only known occurrence of Trump inviting evangelical leaders to the White House happened last July with invitations to about 30 leaders. While some evangelicals did lay their hands on Trump out of a religious respect that can be shown as a sign of responsibility, there is no reports that he was anointed with oil. Also, this occasion was only publicly reported to have occurred once, not seven times. Begley also claims that apparently during Obama’s presidency and possibly presidents before him, "there were all kinds of idol gods and images and all kinds of artifacts in there that were demonic." There is no record proving that any previous presidents engaged in demonology or paganism. The story also says that former President Bill Clinton confessed in his memoir My Life that he and his wife Hillary hosted a voodoo ceremony where a "spirit arrived" possessing participants to walk on hot coals and burn their flesh with fire and one person to bite the head off a living chicken. Clinton did write about attending a voodoo practice in a Haitian village, but they were not the hosts. The Clintons and their now-deceased friend and former Citibank executive David Edwards, who bought the trip as a wedding gift to the Clintons, were given a "brief course in voodoo theology." Clinton wrote: "After several minutes of rhythmic dancing to pounding drums, the spirits arrived, seizing a woman and a man. The man proceeded to rub a burning torch all over his body and walk on hot coals without being burned. The woman, in a frenzy, screamed repeatedly, then grabbed a live chicken and bit its head off. Then the spirits left and those who had been possessed fell to the ground." The passage about the ceremony in My Life make it clear that the Clintons’ attendance of the voodoo session was observational.

pomt-12104	"No president in history has imposed larger personal lifestyle costs on the taxpayer than Donald Trump."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/23/david-frum/are-trumps-travels-imposing-historic-costs-taxpaye/	Following news that President Donald Trump’s packed travel schedule and large family have depleted the Secret Service’s annual funds, conservative pundit David Frum declared the costs incurred by the president unprecedented. "No president in history has imposed larger personal lifestyle costs on the taxpayer than Donald Trump," he wrote on Twitter. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In an interview, Frum clarified that "personal lifestyle costs" excluded work trips, such as the G20 conference in Hamburg, Germany, or presidential residences where security costs are fixed, like the presidential retreat at Camp David. The pricey personal trips Frum had in mind include weekend trips to Trump-owned golf resorts in Palm Beach, Fla., Sterling, Va., and Bedminster, N.J. "The Florida/Bedminster costs are entirely volitional, as are the costs of Melania’s decision to live apart from her husband for most of his first year in office. There is no public purpose to any of those decisions," Frum told PolitiFact. As we’ve said before, it’s hard to separate leisure and work when it comes to the presidency, particularly as Trump has hosted state visits at his resorts. That said, might Trump’s leisure trips and residential circumstances amount to the costliest in presidential history? It’s too early to tell, as even the highest estimates of Trump’s spending can’t match former President Barack Obama’s eight years in office. Although Frum didn’t include this qualifier, he might have meant at this point in Trump’s presidency. Trump does seem on pace to outstrip previous presidential spending by the end of his term. Trump has left the White House more often at this point in his presidency than other modern presidents, according to CBS White House correspondent Mark Knoller, and the cost of protecting Trump while he’s away is not cheap. Here’s the important point to keep in mind: There are no definitive reports on the cost of Trump’s travel, nor of any other president. The most comprehensive analyses exist on Trump and Obama’s presidencies, and have been carried out by watchdog groups. The best available data The Government Accountability Office is the agency that traditionally computes costs for presidential travel, but its analysts have not calculated lifestyle costs for any president. Instead, they’ve looked into specific trips at Congress’ request. The latest report looked at the cost of a four-day vacation President Barack Obama took to Palm Beach in February 2013. The trip cost approximately $3.6 million, and has formed the basis of much speculation on the cost of Trump’s travel. Basing its estimates on that report, the liberal Center for American Progress’ said that a trip to Mar-a-Lago costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 million, which we rated Half True. It’s not precise to stick that price tag on every presidential trip, as costs vary depending on the size of the vehicles used and where they’re flown in from. That trip included a stop in Obama’s hometown of Chicago, and costs for Air Force One travel were also almost $60,000 higher per hour at the time, according to Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations for public records. Using the $3.6 million estimate, the Center for American Progress placed Trump’s personal travel costs through Aug. 3 at $32 million. That’s a bit under a third of what Judicial Watch calculated Obama spent on personal travel in his eight years in office ($100 million). Judicial Watch offered a more conservative estimate for Trump. The watchdog group calculated the costs of five of Trump’s and three of Melania’s Mar-a-Lago visits and Vice President Mike Pence’s Super Bowl trip in February using Air Force hourly travel rates obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Those added up to a total of $3.6 million. That excludes, however, any of Trump’s trips after March and security costs, as the Secret Service hasn’t yet provided the data requested through the Freedom of Information Act. They also exclude other expenses, like $3.3 million in overtime costs Palm Beach County’s presidential residence protection program incurred during Trump’s visits. An internal agency document obtained by the Washington Post in March gives a better estimate of the amount spent on security by the Trump administration. The report said the Secret Service requested $60 million in additional funding for next year. $26.8 million would go to protecting Trump’s family in Trump Tower and $33 million would fund travel costs. The Management and Budget Office had rejected the request. More recently, Secret Service Director Randolph Alles told USA Today that more than 1,000 agents have already hit the federally mandated annual caps for salary and overtime allowances. He attributed the dearth to both an unprecedented number of White House protectees -- Trump has 42, including his 18 family members, whereas Obama had 31 -- and efforts to secure Trump’s multiple residences. Alles is in conversation with lawmakers to raise the cap from $160,000 per year to $187,000, but even that would leave 130 veteran agents without full compensation for hundreds of hours of work. Congress also had to approve compensation for 1,400 agents’ thousands of hours of overtime that were earned above the limit in 2016. In the absence of concrete cost figures, we compared the president and the vice president’s collective travel, measured loosely by the number of days logged by Secret Service agents protecting the vice president and president when they traveled. More agents worked travel days protecting Obama and Vice President Joe Biden at the six-month mark than Trump: 534 travel days to 378 for Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. But when we added the president and vice president’s associated family members into the mix, agents had traveled 4,054 days protecting Trump to Obama’s 1,621. That’s in part because Trump has a larger family with adult children whose business ties take them all over the world. The 567 personnel assigned to the Office of Protective Operation are projected to exceed the pay cap in 2017, which put them on track to equal the total overtime hours worked in 2016. Our rating Frum said "No president in history has imposed larger personal lifestyle costs on the taxpayer than Donald Trump." It’s too early to call Trump’s personal travel itinerary the costliest in presidential history, as he’s only a few months into the job. It’s also a bold claim to make in the absence of definitive data on the costs of presidential travel, which is generally not disclosed. Frum may nonetheless be onto something. Travel and security records we gathered suggest Trump is on pace to outstrip Obama’s spending on security and transport costs. But it’s still too soon to tell, and Frum’s statement remains an exaggeration. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04119	"Our numbers are going up at the airport."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jan/10/james-bennett/providence-economic-development-director-james-ben/	To demonstrate that progress has been made in Rhode Island during his first two years in office, Gov. Lincoln Chafee released a YouTube video on Jan. 1 that featured various officials talking about economic development, education and regulatory reform. One of those officials is James Bennett, Providence's director of economic development. On the video, he talks about how Chafee has helped lower costs for airlines, making it less expensive for people to fly in and out of T.F. Green Airport. "Our numbers are going up at the airport," he says. Most of the news reports we've seen about passenger traffic at Green have not been encouraging, so we called Bennett's office to find out where he was getting his numbers. While we waited, we went to the Rhode Island Airport Corporation's website, which posts monthly reports on passenger traffic at Green. As of the end of November, passenger traffic at the airport was down 6.5 percent for 2012 compared with what it was during the first 11 months of 2011. The only months that showed increases over the previous year were January and February. On a year-to-year basis, the number of passengers going through the airport has been dropping steadily since the peak of 5.7 million in 2005. The number in 2011 was 3.9 million. That's an annual decline of 6.3 percent, or a drop of 32.2 percent over six years. The December number has not been released yet, but in order for the airport to have ended 2012 with more passengers than in 2011, traffic in December would need to have been 80 percent higher than it was in December 2011. When Bennett got back to us via e-mail, he said he wasn't talking about passenger traffic at all: "What I was referring to in my comments was the increased capacity of 450 additional seats a day or 13,500 extra seating capacity a month out of Green with JetBlue," which began service at the airport on Nov. 29. We wrote back to Bennett asking, "What's the point of having extra seats if they're not being filled?" He responded: "In my experience in business the basic idea of supply and demand will bring prices down and after 30 days I'm hopeful that adding JetBlue supply will increase demand and therefore bullish on stopping the downward trend previous to November 29 2012." To double check Bennett’s number of available seats, we called the Airport Corporation. It turns out that, on a year-to-year-basis, the number of available airplane seats isn't up, even with the addition of JetBlue. Just the opposite, the seat count has been falling rapidly. According to data provided by Peter Frazier, the interim president and CEO of the corporation, the average number of airplane seats each weekday, which is the how the airport tracks such data, was down nearly 10 percent in December 2012 compared with December of the previous year. In fact, the decline has been in the double digits for nine of the last twelve months. We also looked at month-to-month changes. They tend to be all over the map due to seasonal fluctuations. The number of seats in December, after JetBlue service began, did rise by 179 (or 3 percent) compared with November. But the number will drop below pre-JetBlue levels in January 2013, if the airlines stick to their published schedules -- a reduction in 558 seats or a 9 percent drop. But Frazier said month-to-month seat number comparisons are risky. "We wouldn't do that. The industry doesn't do that. There's so much fluctuation," he said. "Sure the numbers aren't higher, but the rate of decrease has definitely slowed with JetBlue's presence." But, once again, that doesn't mean there will be passengers to fill those seats. "I'm more focused on getting people on the plane," said Frazier. "Typically, when you say your 'numbers are going up' at the airport, you're not saying the number of seats." Our ruling James Bennett said, "Our numbers are going up at the airport." When experts talk about the success of an airport, they look at the number of passengers using the facility, not the number of seats available to purchase. We believe the vast majority of viewers of Chafee’s YouTube video will come away believing that, when Bennett reports that "our numbers are going up," he is reporting that passenger volume is up. In fact -- as The Journal has repeatedly reported -- the opposite is true. The passenger numbers have been dropping for years. Maybe the addition of JetBlue will reverse the downward trend. But the impression Bennett is giving in the video is so at odds from the facts, the judges rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-03479	Says less than half of 1 percent of all the Texas legislators who ever served draw "a benefit" from pensions tied to the salaries of state district judges.	false	/texas/statements/2013/jun/13/doug-miller/legislator-says-less-half-1-percent-texas-legislat/	State Rep. Doug Miller declared that very few legislators, who are paid $7,200 a year plus expenses, have qualified to draw pension benefits based on the much greater salary of a state district judge. During Texas House debate May 21, 2013, the New Braunfels Republican pointed out that a legislator has to serve eight years to qualify for the pension if he or she retires at age 60, or 10 years "if you retired at age 50." (Actually, a legislator needs to serve 12 years to retire with the benefits at age 50, according to a booklet from the Employees Retirement System of Texas.) Miller further declared that it takes 43 years and six months of service to qualify for 100 percent of the pension, which is equal to the salary of a state district judge. For each year of service, a legislator qualifies for a pension equal to 2.3 percent of the judicial salary, which has been $125,000 since 2005, Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman reported in a column posted online May 30, 2013. Miller wasn’t done. After noting the average tenures of current lawmakers, he said, "Less than half a percent of the people that ever served, and there have been over 5,000 people (who) served in this House, less than half a percent ever receive a benefit under this (pension) plan." We took that as Miller saying that less than half of 1 percent of House and Texas Senate members ever drew a pension benefit, an interpretation Miller confirmed by telephone. Is that right? To our request for backup information, Miller’s office sent us a document indicating that 63 of the 181 current members of the House and Senate, 35 percent, will have served 10 years or more through 2013. This was accompanied by a 27-page document, dated May 21, 2013, and attributed to the Legislative Reference Library, listing legislators since statehood who have served 10 years or more. According to news accounts, lawmakers tied legislator pensions to the salary of a state district judge in 1975. By telephone, Mary Jane Wardlow, a spokeswoman for the Employees Retirement System of Texas, said that a 1969 law previously allowed legislators to contribute a portion of their pay check to the retirement system, which would potentially have qualified them for pensions tied to their own salaries. Unsaid: The 1975 law set in motion better long-term rewards. And according to a May 17, 2013, Texas Tribune news article, lawmakers this year were poised to increase the base salary of state district judges by 12 percent, to $140,000, which would increase the legislative pension benefit by at least $2,760 a year. "Actual benefits vary depending on choices lawmakers make in their plans (they can opt out, though few do so), on other pensions, and non-legislative government service and so on," the story said, with eligible members qualifying for annual pensions of $27,760 to $140,000. The story said that former House Speaker Tom Craddick, a House member since the late 1960s, would be subject to a cap of $140,000 "since the benefit can't exceed the amount of the judicial salary it's based on." Also, the story said, retired lawmakers would draw the increases in pension payments, too. "The retired elected officials class currently includes 513 former legislators, district attorneys and others," the Tribune said, "as well as 137 survivor beneficiaries, each of whom collects an average of $44,196 in annual benefits." Miller did not specify how he determined the number of legislators who have drawn a benefit from the pension. But by email, his chief of staff, Fritz Reinig, pointed out the reference library’s online database listing every legislator since 1846. Texas joined the United States in late 1845. Working from the library’s lists, we estimated the number of legislators who at least became eligible for the pension, conservatively sticking with Miller's formulation tied to 10 years of service rather than the minimum of 8 years needed to qualify. By our count, about 380 legislators served 10 years or more from 1969 through the 2013 regular session. Over those years, reference librarian Catherine Wusterhausen told us by email, 971 individuals served as legislators. Put another way, then, approximately 39 percent of legislators would have qualified for the pension benefit, though this is not to say that each one signed up for it; that’s not public information, Wardlow said. Yet Miller’s claim referred to all legislators since statehood. Our search of the library’s database for every legislator since 1846 delivered 5,515 names, which was probably too high. Wusterhausen told us by email that, like her 971 count, this figure would include temporary acting representatives and those later removed following an election contest plus individuals elected but not sworn in. Conservatively speaking, still, our estimated 380 legislators who could have qualified for the pension comprise 7 percent of all Texas legislators through history. What gives? Miller, apprised of our analysis, said his intent was to show that few legislators serve long enough to qualify for the potential pensions. From his list, for instance, it appears that nine of the House’s 150 members will have served 21 years or more through 2013. That's how long a member would have to serve to potentially draw a pension equal to half a district judge’s salary. Miller agreed his "half of 1 percent" claim did not come out as intended. "It’s the heat of the debate," he said. Our ruling Miller said that "less than half of 1 percent" of Texas legislators through history have drawn a benefit from the pension tied to the salary of a state district judge. Granted, the state cannot reveal which legislators have qualified or chosen to take the pension. But by our reckoning based on legislative rosters, more than 7 percent of legislators through history could have qualified for the pension benefit. That’s misleading in itself, though, because only about 1,000 legislators have served since the benefit was put into law. We estimate that 39 percent of actual potential beneficiaries have served 10 years or more, meaning they could have qualified for the pension. Either percentage is considerably more than "less than half of 1 percent," leaving this claim as False.	None	Doug Miller	None	None	None	2013-06-13T11:08:41	2013-05-21	['Texas']

pomt-02706	"Of all cities in the United States with more than 100,000 people, Providence is the 183rd safest."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/dec/30/brett-smiley/mayoral-candidate-brett-smiley-says-providence-183/	When Democratic mayoral candidate Brett Smiley unveiled his plan for combating crime in Providence, he sought to drive home the need for new approaches to crime and policing. "Of all cities in the United States with more than 100,000 people, Providence is the 183rd safest," he said. "Last year, major cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Dallas all had lower crime rates than Providence. This is unacceptable, and it has to change." Smiley’s campaign said they got the figures by combining statistics in the FBI’s most recent annual compilation of crime figures from across the country. Each year, the agency releases "Crime in the United States," prepared by the agency’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program. It tracks a range of violent and non-violent crimes, tabulating how many of them occurred across the country. The figures can be analyzed in a number of ways, such as by individual crimes and by how many crimes occurred per thousand residents. The figures are organized by state, and, within each state, by individual cities or towns with more than 100,000 residents. Every time the agency releases its national crime statistics, analysts and organizations across the country break down the state-by-state data and reassemble them into one large database. Often, the information is to sorted by number of crimes reported per 1,000 residents. Hence, the "safest cities" the United States list. Based on the 2012 FBI statistics, Providence comes in at 183rd among 279 cities with populations of 100,000 or more. In first place is Cary, N.C., while Chicago is last. So Smiley is right on the numbers. But on its website announcing the release of the Uniform Crime Reports, the FBI makes it very clear it wishes people wouldn’t compare the cities that way. "Each year when ‘Crime in the United States’ is published, many entities — news media, tourism agencies, and other groups with an interest in crime in our nation — use reported figures to compile rankings of cities and counties," the agency says. Those rankings, it says, don’t consider other variables, such as economic and demographic factors, that affect crime rates. Such rankings "lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting cities and counties, along with their residents," the FBI statement said. Emphasizing the point in boldface and italic print, the FBI websites closes with a caveat that "the data user is, therefore, cautioned against comparing statistical data of individual reporting units from cities, counties, metropolitan areas, states, or colleges or universities solely on the basis of their population coverage or student enrollment." In other words, exactly what Smiley did. In his defense, he is far from the alone. For instance, in Cary, N.C. officials were quick to credit law enforcement’s close relationship with the community for its putative title as 2012’s safest city in the United States. Naperville, Ill., has done the same thing over the years. Other municipalities in the top ten likewise had officials or organizations that touted their rankings. Our ruling Mayoral candidate Brett Smiley said, "Of all cities in the United States with more than 100,000 people, Providence is the 183rd safest." He accurately quoted the city’s ranking. But the FBI, the source of the raw data, warns that such rankings can produce out-of-context impressions. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Brett Smiley	None	None	None	2013-12-30T00:01:00	2013-12-19	['United_States']
pomt-15076	Says Bernie Sanders opposes "requiring all children to have a K-12 education."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/21/viral-image/web-graphic-says-bernie-sanders-doesnt-support-com/	As the Democratic primary race between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont heats up, supporters of each candidate have aggressively gone after the other. We recently looked at a graphic circulating on social media, presumably assembled by backers of Sanders, that contrasted the two candidates’ views on a variety of issues. We found that the descriptions were Mostly True about the candidates’ stances on the death penalty and Mostly True about their positions on trade policy. This time we’ll look at a graphic -- this one presumably put together by Clinton backers -- that compares them on a different set of issues. Here, we’ll check the line in the graphic that says, "supports requiring all children to have a K-12 education." The chart says "yes" for Clinton and "no" for Sanders. (We asked the Clinton campaign if they wanted to comment, but they declined, saying that they had not produced the graphic.) We had no difficulty tracking down the source of this claim, since the chart cites an article in the liberal magazine Mother Jones. Recently, the magazine has published a few articles reviewing Sanders’ early history in politics and activism. In one, Mother Jones tracked down some of Sanders’ writings from a now-defunct newspaper called the Vermont Freeman. "Some of his rants bordered on libertarian," wrote Mother Jones’ Tim Murphy. In August 1969 in a column titled "Reflections on a Dying Society," Sanders wrote this: It is obvious that in the name of "public safety" the State is usurping the rights of free choice in many domains of life. To get (a Federal Housing Authority) loan, one MUST build with specified lumber and materials; to drive an automobile, one MUST have insurance and a car which has no rust going through; to run a farm and sell milk one MUST have a bulk tank; to drive a motorcycle one MUST have a helmet, to cite a few examples. The idea that ALL children MUST attend school until 16 years of age, even if some would rather do other things, is now treated as as given a fact of life as the sunrise. Another Mother Jones article pointed to an article from Seven Days, an alternative weekly in Burlington, Vt., in 1981, shortly after Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington for the first time. The weekly recapped Sanders’ political development and his four statewide races as the nominee of the left-wing Liberty Union Party between 1972 and 1976. "During his four races for state office as a Liberty Unionist, Sanders called for public takeover of utilities, a guaranteed minimum wage, the abolition of compulsory education, and a radical revision of the nation's tax structure," the 1981 article said. In other words, the chart pegs Sanders’ current view on compulsory K-12 education to a column he wrote 46 years ago and to campaigns he ran in the early-to-mid 1970s. That’s pretty weak support. Is there any evidence that Sanders still has the same stance today? His office declined repeated requests to supply an answer, but we found some evidence on our own in Sanders’ legislative record in the Senate. In the previous Congress, Sanders introduced the DIPLOMA Act, which would have authorized grants for disadvantaged youth. The grants would be designed to ensure that "youth are ready for school," "are engaged and achieving in school," and that "students are ready for postsecondary education at institutions of higher education and 21st century careers." He also introduced the Supporting Community Schools Act of 2013, which would give local educational agencies tools to transform under-performing schools. The goals of these efforts would be to improve student achievement, to close achievement gaps between groups of students, and to increase student attendance and graduation rates. (Neither measure advanced through committee.) We couldn’t find any recent comments of Sanders opposing compulsory education. Our ruling A chart on the Internet said that Sanders does not support "requiring all children to have a K-12 education." However, it bases this claim on writings and campaigns from more than 40 years ago, and more recent legislative evidence indicates that Sanders supports a traditional view of K-12 education. We rate the claim False.	None	Viral image	None	None	None	2015-09-21T18:00:00	2015-09-08	['Bernie_Sanders']

pomt-06363	"Government employees make 43 percent more in wages and benefits" than private-sector workers.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/04/building-better-ohio/building-better-ohio-says-public-workers-make-43-p/	Ohio's debate over Issue 2, the referendum on Senate Bill 5, has drawn particular attention to the compensation of public employees. Voters will decide the fate of the issue Nov. 8. Voting "yes" on Issue 2 is voting in favor of SB 5, which restricts the collective bargaining rights of all public workers in the state. A "no" vote on Issue 2 is a vote to repeal SB 5. Issue 2 supporters say that SB 5 would help control costs for public employers at the state and local levels. The argument is distilled in "Had Enough," a 30-second TV spot from the political action group Building a Better Ohio. "Without Issue 2," the voice-over narration says, "hard-working Ohio families will face higher taxes to pay for the excessive wages and benefits of government employees, who already make 43 percent more than the rest of us." Reinforcing the point, words on the screen say, "Government employees make 43 percent more in wages and benefits." The assertion that Ohioans will face higher taxes is speculative. PolitiFact Ohio can't rate it because it involves predicting the future. But PolitiFact Ohio was interested in the assertion that the compensation of public employees is 43 percent higher -- almost half again as much -- than the compensation of workers in the private sector. We asked Building a Better Ohio for the basis of its claim. Press secretary Connie Wehrkamp referred us to a recent study that the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group,prepared for the Ohio Business Roundtable. The study found that public workers, based on wages alone, earn about 2.5 percent less than comparable private employees. But it concluded that public workers make 43 percent more when the value of benefits, including pensions and "job security," are factored in. AEI authors Andrew Biggs and Jason Richwine said that wages were "comparable," that pensions and health insurance helped give public workers a 31.2 percent edge in non-wage benefits. The most significant factor came in the way they calculated pension funding for public and private sector workers, putting a premium on the "guaranteed" element of public pensions. We will return to that. Job security, they said, adds an economic value of about 10 percent -- meaning that job security makes a $40,000-a-year job, for example, worth $44,000 to the employee. But that’s not the same as the public employer giving the employee $4,000 more in a paycheck. But that wasn't the last or first word. The study came in response to a paper by Rutgers University professor Jeffrey Keefe that was published by the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Keefe's study said that Ohio public employees annually earn 6 percent less on average than comparable private-sector employees in total compensation (wages and non-wage benefits). Keefe followed it in October with another paper rebutting the study from AEI. In our reading of the studies, the biggest disagreements came in the areas of health benefits for retirees (which not all public employees receive), pension costs and job security. We sought guidance on those matters -- or a referee -- from the authoritative and nonpartisan Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Because of its interest in pension plans, the center published a research paper in September that examined other papers and compared public and private compensation. The center found no real disagreement among researchers that state and local workers as a group "are paid less than their private sector counterparts. "The question," it continued, "is the extent to which the value of the benefits provided to state-local workers offsets the wage penalty." It determined the answer was not as great as what the AEI paper asserts. Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research, told us that the largest points of contention with the AEI study came over pension funding and job security. The primary issue with pension funding was disagreement about the "discount rate," which is the interest rate used in figuring how much money must be set aside today to make future payments. The estimates of those costs in the AEI study push up the figure for public employers far higher than what the Center for Retirement Research found. Conversely, AEI’s study projected smaller Social Security costs for private employers. Several economists told us that the discount rate is a hotly contentious issue in the field, largely because the "correct" rate can't be proven empirically. Munnell noted that the center put no added value on job security, because the historical advantage in the public sector has diminished or disappeared. When it has existed, she said, job security was taken into account as the trade off for lower wages in public employment. Making it a separate factor would be double counting. "We concluded," Munnell said, "that public sector compensation in Ohio is 9 percent higher than private sector compensation." What does PolitiFact Ohio conclude? The claim does contain an element of truth. The non-partisan Center for Retirement Research would agree with the notion that benefit packages on average can increase the value of a public employee’s compensation package above that of the average private sector worker. But there are critical facts that give a different impression of Building a Better Ohio’s claim. There is general agreement that public employee wages, on average, are less. The AEI study Building a Better Ohio relies on estimates they are about 2.5 less than comparable private employees. The ad from Building a Better Ohio flatly states that public employees "make 43 percent more" than private sector workers. We think the average listener would interpret that as meaning the average public employee is paid - in wages and benefits - 43 percent more. But some components of the AEI study aren’t based on money changing hands, but rather on the value to the employee of certain benefits. Even leaving out the considerable disagreements over the calculation of pension costs, the inclusion of job security as a monetized figure in compensation is questionable. The AEI study says that security has a value of 10 percent of the pay. But that doesn’t translate to more money paid to the employee. Whether it exists or not, job security is an intangible factor, like job satisfaction, that can't be spent, saved or taxed. It doesn’t put more dollars and cents into employee compensation. We think it is misleading to include it in an accounting of what workers "make." Also, the AEI study arrived at its 43 percent figure through rounding that we could not follow, and which the Center for Retirement Research questioned, after adding the 10 percent for job security to the 31.2 percent advantage in non-wage benefits it says that public workers have a 43 percent edge over their private sector counterparts. And that 31.2 percent advantage -- whose calculation is the subject of considerable disagreement in the pension and financial worlds -- is more than three times the finding of the Center for Retirement Research. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Building a Better Ohio’s claim Mostly False.	None	Building a Better Ohio	None	None	None	2011-11-04T06:00:00	2011-10-14	['None']

pomt-13436	"Tim Kaine hiked tuition as governor, but now claims to champion affordability."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/sep/19/republican-national-committee-republican/gop-makes-tricky-claim-tim-kaine-hiked-tuition-gov/	Tim Kaine’s national call this year to make a college education more affordable clashes with his record when he was governor of Virginia, according to the Republican National Committee. Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, wrote a Sept. 12 op-ed in Time magazine touting proposals by Hillary Clinton, his running mate, to cut college costs. He said the ticket’s goal is to make a college education debt-free for everyone and tuition-free for in-state students from families who earn less than $125,000 a year. In explaining how the plan would work, Kaine wrote, "institutions and states alike will have to commit to lowering costs and raising their own investments in education if they want to continue receiving federal funding." The RNC fired back the same day with a blog post headlined, "Tim Kaine hiked tuition as governor, but now claims to champion affordability." We investigated the RNC’s statement. We’ll start with the easy part, that Kaine now "claims to champion affordability." This is self-evident. Kaine wrote in the op-ed that the Democratic ticket’s plan "will help anyone willing to work for a quality, affordable college degree." Now, let’s look at the thornier part: whether "Kaine hiked tuition" when he was governor from January 2006 to January 2010. While reading this, keep in mind that Virginia’s fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. So when Kaine took office, tuition for the 2005-06 budget year already was set. The average cost for in-state tuition and instructional fees at four-year institutions - not including room and board - was $3,812. It rose to $5,003 in fiscal 2009-10, when Kaine left office. That’s a 31.2 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, it's about a 19 percent rise. The average cost for tuition and instructional fees at Virginia’s community colleges rose from $2,182 in the 2005-06 school year to $2,716 in 2009-10. That’s a 24.5 percent increase. Adjusted for inflation, it's about a 13 percent rise. Sure enough, tuition did go up during Kaine’s term. But did Kaine "hike" tuition, as the RNC says? The answer is complicated. Technically, Kaine didn’t raise the rates. Virginia’s public colleges largely are autonomous, and have had freedom under the last four governors to set their own tuition. Kaine, however, did have a role in setting political conditions early in his term that made it easy for colleges to raise tuition and budget conditions later in his administration that pressured colleges to keep increasing them. Virginia colleges usually generate about 82 percent of their revenues through tuition, fees and grants, according to data from the House Appropriations Committee. The remaining 18 percent is allocated by the General Assembly. It comes from the state’s general fund, which is raised mostly through income and sales taxes. Kaine, when he entered the governor’s mansion half way through fiscal 2005-06, inherited a $1.45 billion general fund budget for higher education. That rose to $1.76 billion in the 2007-08 budget year. Despite that healthy increase, in-state tuition and fees went up cumulatively by about 17 percent during the first two years of Kaine’s administration, according to figures from the State Council for Higher Education in Virginia. Although Kaine expressed concern about the rising rates, we were unable to find an instance in which he publicly castigated colleges for their stewardship. Neither he nor the General Assembly tried to cap in-state tuition increases at the inflation rate - a restraint that was used during the consecutive governorships of Republicans George Allen and Jim Gilmore from 1994 to 2002. Kaine said he would favor such a cap only if the state significantly raised its funding of colleges. In late 2008, Virginia began to feel the sting of the Great Recession and Kaine began ordering massive cuts in state spending. They included a $341 million reduction in the general fund contribution to colleges during the final two budget years of his term. Tuition increased by about 13 percent during that two-year period. In 2012, when Kaine was running successfully for the U.S. Senate, state Republicans said the college cuts ordered by Kaine drove up tuition. Indeed, college officials did warn during the recession that they would have to recoup money by raising student costs. But it should be noted that all of the spending levels Kaine recommended for colleges and universities - within a few dollars - were in state budgets that were approved with overwhelming bipartisan support in the General Assembly. We also should point out that before, during and after the recession, Virginia colleges have been raising tuition and fees well beyond the rate of inflation. The average annual increase during the past 15 school years has been 7.2 percent, according to SCHEV. Inflation has increased by an average of about 2.3 percent annually during the same span, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Virginia’s experience wasn’t unique when Kaine was governor; tuition and fees for in-state students at four-year public universities rose across the U.S. during his term. The U.S. Department of Education said the national average increased by 23 percent during that span; the College Board says costs rose by 29 percent. Our ruling The RNC says, "Tim Kaine hiked tuition as governor, but now claims to champion affordability." As the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Kaine clearly is taking on college affordability by advocating debt-free college for everyone and tuition-free education for in-state students from families making less than $125,000 a year. When Kaine was governor from 2006 to 2010, in-state tuition and instructional fees rose 31.2 percent at four-year colleges and 24.5 percent at community colleges. But it’s misleading to say Kaine "hiked" the rates. Colleges largely are autonomous in Virginia and allowed to set their own student costs. Tuition has been rising steadily in Virginia and across the nation for decades. On the other hand, Virginia’s governor and its legislature do create political and budgetary conditions that can encourage or discourage colleges from steep tuition increases. While Kaine did not pull the lever for the tuition hikes, they did occur under his watch. So on the whole, we rate the RNC’s statement Half True.

pomt-09560	"What were the old annual deficits under Republicans have now become the monthly deficits under Democrats."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/29/jeb-hensarling/rep-hensarling-says-annual-deficits-under-republic/	We felt like President Barack Obama gave us a direct assignment on Friday afternoon. In his retreat with Republicans on Jan. 29, 2010, Obama and Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, were sparring over deficits, when Obama issued this challenge. "I am happy to have any independent fact-checker out there take a look at your presentation versus mine in terms of the accuracy of what I just said," Obama said. It was like the president was speaking directly to us here at PolitiFact. In this item, we'll examine Hensarling's side of the exchange. Hensarling began by saying that an alternative 2010 budget offered by House Republicans in April would have grown government spending far slower than the Democrats' plan. "And since that budget was ignored," he said, "what were the old annual deficits under Republicans have now become the monthly deficits under Democrats. The national debt has increased 30 percent." Hensarling asked if Obama's 2011 budget would "continue to take us down the path of increasing the cost of government to almost 25 percent of our economy." Obama said the question sounded more like a talking point from someone running a campaign and was an example of why it's so hard to achieve bipartisan legislation. But was Hensarling right that the old annual deficits under Republicans are now the monthly ones under the Democrats? Only if you do some serious cherry-picking. In a press release issued by Hensarling after the meeting, he noted that the monthly deficit in October 2009 was $176 billion. That's really the first month you can attribute wholly to Democrats -- Obama and the Democrat-controlled Congress. And it's also a high-water mark. The CBO estimates a total 2010 deficit of $1.35 trillion, which works out to an average of about $112 billion per month. So while the deficits fluctuate month-to-month, we think the average is the fairest number when you refer to "monthly deficits under Democrats." So to begin with, Hensarling is choosing the highest number. Hensarling compares the October 2009 number to fiscal year 2007 -- the last year in which the nation had a Republican president, George W. Bush, and a Republican-controlled Congress handling the budget -- when the total deficit that year was $162 billion. But that was one of the smaller deficits under Bush. Over his full, eight-year term (including much of the 2009 deficit that rightly falls to him), the country ran up $3.3 trillion in total deficits. That works out to an average of about $412 billion per year -- more than double the number Hensarling is using. If you want to just look at the six years Bush had a Republican Congress, the average drops to about $260 billion a year. Some would argue that to cut out the recession years -- when the deficit exploded -- is unfair (and we agree), but even under that scenario, Hensarling's statistic doesn't hold up if you consider the average monthly deficit under Democrats' full control rather than cherry-picking one particularly high month. "If he were to say the highest monthly deficit months under Obama versus the lower deficit years under Bush and the Republican Congress, then his numbers are right," said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. With those kinds of qualifiers, you could argue that the deficit in October 2009 under Obama ($176 billion) was more than the entire 2007 fiscal year under Bush and a Republican Congress ($162 billion). But that's not what Hensarling said. For the sake of argument, let's do some cherry-picking of our own. In October 2008, the month before Obama was even elected, the monthly deficit was $232 billion. That's higher than any of the monthly deficits under Obama. In fact, many of the monthly deficits since the recession began -- and which fall under the watch of Bush and a Democrat-controlled Congress -- have routinely rivaled the monthly deficits under Obama. So using Hensarling's technique, we could also claim that Bush's deficit was higher than Obama's. Hensarling's director of communications, George Rasley, said it was a mistake to look at the numbers as Obama versus Bush. Rather, he said, Hensarling was comparing Democrats to Republicans, not presidents. For the last two years of the Bush administration, he said, Democrats in Congress were "controlling the purse strings." But we think dialing back the clock to full Republican control not only leaves Bush entirely off the hook for his role in running up the deficit, it conveniently predates the recession, which has contributed greatly to the deficits. As for Hensarling's claim that the national debt has increased 30 percent, that figure also is misleading. The public debt did increase 30 percent over the fiscal 2009 year. The fiscal year runs from the beginning of October until the end of September. In other words, Obama was inaugurated four months into the fiscal year. The Obama administration's first budget proposal was for the 2010 fiscal year. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget office estimated the 2009 deficit at nearly $1.2 trillion on the day Obama was sworn in. Obama increased it by about $250 billion, but we think the bulk of the deficit that contributed to the sharp increase in the public debt in 2009 falls to President Bush and the Democratic majority in Congress at the time. We note that under Obama and the Democratic Congress, the debt held by the public is expected to increase another 16.6 percent in the 2010 fiscal year. Hensarling's comparison also ignores the hand Obama was dealt, said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. While the stimulus has certainly contributed to the deficits in Obama's budgets, he said, they are also largely due to realities in place before Obama took office -- a recession, two wars, unfunded Bush tax cuts and Medicare prescription drug coverage. "Any year," Horney said, "the deficit is largely the result of everything that goes before it." In summary, Hensarling's numbers only work if you cherry-pick the highest month under full Democratic control and compare it to one of the lowest years under full Republican control. If you compare average months (about $112 billion a month for Obama and the Democratic Congress) to average years under Bush (about $412 billion a year if you include his full 8-year term, or about $260 billion a year if you only include the first six years with a Republican Congress), Hensarling's numbers are wrong. There are so many bookkeeping tricks in this one that he's far from the truth. We rule his claim False.

pomt-13175	Says President Obama "was proposing pinprick strikes" for military intervention in Syria.	false	/florida/statements/2016/oct/27/marco-rubio/rubio-says-obama-was-proposing-pinprick-strikes-sy/	Marco Rubio decried President Barack Obama’s past Syria strategy during the second U.S. Senate debate in Davie, saying Obama had supported small and ineffectual attacks. Debate moderator Patricia Mazzei of the Miami Herald noted during the Oct. 26 event with U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy at Broward College that Rubio voted against airstrikes in Syria, and asked if he favored committing ground troops there. Rubio said he would support a plan if he thought it would work but didn’t think using American soldiers was a good option. He said he voted against Obama’s plan because he had favored helping factions already in Syria over committing to airstrikes. "He (Obama) was proposing what they called pinprick strikes — basically a symbolic strike to send a message, but not backed up by a clear plan," Rubio said, without elaborating on who "they" were. Obama did use the term "pinprick strikes," but it was to specifically advocate against what Rubio is attributing to him. Military intervention Rubio’s "pinprick strikes" go back to 2013, when Obama was grappling with how to deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons attack against civilians. Washington had planned a military response against the Assad regime, but Obama changed his mind on Aug. 31. Instead of acting unilaterally, Obama planned to first ask Congress to authorize an attack. His approach reportedly would have involved surgical missile strikes by Navy destroyers. Obama did use the term "pinprick" several times. But every time he did, it was to describe what he wanted the U.S. military to avoid. Obama said it during an interview blitz on Sept. 9. In one example, he told the Today show’s Savannah Guthrie that "the U.S. does not do pinpricks. Our military is the greatest the world has ever known. And when we take even limited strikes, it has an impact on a country like Syria." There is no technical term like "pinprick" when describing any kind of military intervention, Michael O’Hanlon, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and co-director of the institution’s Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, told us in a previous fact-check of this Rubio attack. O’Hanlon said that in his experience, when the word is used, "it is always pejorative." Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on Face the Nation on Sept. 1, 2013, that he wondered whether surgical strikes are "just a pinprick that somehow Bashar Assad can trumpet that he defeated the United States of America." The vote mentioned at the debate came on Sept. 4, when Rubio voted against a Senate Foreign Relations Committee resolution allowing Obama to use limited force against Assad’s regime. It passed by a 10-7 vote and was sent to the Senate. The same day, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also used the term during a hearing for the House Foreign Affairs Committee on strategy in Syria. "The president has said ... this would not be a pinprick. Those were his words. This would be a significant strike that would in fact degrade his capability," Hagel said. Secretary of State John Kerry did refer to the planned intervention as an "unbelievably small, limited kind of effort" on Sept. 9, but he didn’t call it a "pinprick." As support waned in the Senate, Obama asked the Senate majority leader, then Harry Reid, to pull the measure. Obama said on Sept. 10 that the military would not intervene but could in the future. "As some members of Congress have said, there's no point in simply doing a pinprick strike in Syria," Obama said. "Let me make something clear: The United States military doesn't do pinpricks." Rubio voted in favor of arming Syrian rebels a year later. Rubio’s campaign pointed out that Obama revisited the term in the November 2016 issue of Vanity Fair when he said there were no easy solutions in Syria. "The conventional arguments about what could have been done are wrong. The notion that if we had provided some more modest arms to Syrian rebels — that somehow that would have led to Assad’s overthrow more decisively," Obama said. "The notion that if I had taken a pinprick strike when the chemical-weapons issue came out, as opposed to negotiating and getting all those chemical weapons out — that that would have been decisive. All those things I tend to be skeptical about." It’s not clear if Obama is characterizing his own proposed strike as a "pinprick," or describing a potential attack the way others may have suggested. Even so, it’s still clear that back in 2013, he specifically avoided defining his proposal as any form of "pinprick." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Rubio said Obama "was proposing pinprick strikes" for military intervention in Syria. In 2013, Obama did suggest a limited military response — likely airstrikes from Navy ships — after Assad’s chemical weapons attacks on civilians. Obama only used the word "pinprick" to describe what he didn’t want the attacks to be, and said repeatedly that the U.S. military isn’t built for small-scale action. And while some officials have used the term, "pinprick strikes" aren’t a true military description for any kind of operation.

pomt-00934	Homeopathy, acupuncture and aromatherapy "have been given elevated legitimacy under the Affordable Care Act."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/24/jonah-goldberg/did-aca-give-elevated-legitimacy-alternative-medic/	Editor's note, Feb. 25, 2015: One of the core principles of our work, and the work of all journalists, is to contact the subjects whom we are writing about. In this fact-check, we didn’t meet our high standards. While we emailed Jonah Goldberg five days before publishing our fact-check, we never followed up with a phone call or another email to see if he had seen our questions. And while we also attempted to contact Goldberg’s source, Kevin Williamson, we did so only by Twitter. That’s not good enough in our book. Goldberg has since responded to this fact-check via a column on NationalReview.com. While there is nothing in his response that changes our Half True rating, we should have made every attempt to reach him so he could make his points prior to publication. For that, we are sorry. PolitiFact has published literally hundreds of fact-checks on President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, so it’s always a surprise when a reader stumps us with a fresh claim they’ve run across. Recently, a reader sent us a column from the conservative National Review that said the law gives preferred treatment to non-traditional forms of medicine. The column was from Jonah Goldberg, citing the work of another National Review writer, Kevin Williamson. "As my National Review colleague Kevin Williamson notes, ‘Everybody wants to know what Scott Walker and Sarah Palin think about evolution, but almost nobody is asking what Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama think about homeopathy, acupuncture, aromatherapy and the like.’ Even though such remedies have been given elevated legitimacy under the Affordable Care Act." We wondered: Is Goldberg right that the law gives "elevated legitimacy" to such non-traditional techniques? It turns out there’s a solid core of truth to the claim, but also some important caveats. (Neither Williamson nor Goldberg returned inquiries for this fact-check.) Where the claim has a point In recent years, the use of "complementary and alternative medicine" (also called "integrative health care") has grown substantially. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found that roughly four of every 10 American adults and one of every nine children uses at least one form of alternative medicine. That category includes such fields as acupuncture, chiropractic, diet therapies (such as the Atkins, Ornish, South Beach or vegetarian diet), homeopathy, hypnosis, massage therapy, tai chi and yoga. Following a lobbying campaign by alternative-medicine practitioners, and assistance from then-Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, several provisions favorable to non-traditional forms of medicine were inserted into the health care law. Here are provisions that stand to benefit complementary and alternative medicine: • Section 3502 establishes grants for medical homes. The law says that the interdisciplinary teams supporting such homes may include "licensed complementary and alternative medicine practitioners" and "doctors of chiropractic." • Section 4001 establishes the National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council and, in turn, an advisory group on prevention, health promotion, and integrative and public health issues. • Section 4206 creates a pilot program to provide at-risk individuals who use community health centers with "individualized wellness plans" designed to reduce risk factors for preventable conditions, including integrative health techniques. • Section 5101 creates a National Healthcare Workforce Commission and expands the definition of the health care workforce to include integrative health care practitioner, licensed complementary and alternative medicine provider, and doctors of chiropractic. • Section 6301 establishes the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to fund research that determines which medical techniques work best. Some of the institute’s research addresses alternative medicine, including a study of "non-pharmacologic strategies to reduce pain and depression," as well as efforts to compare acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia among cancer survivors. The institute is also funding studies of "relaxation and mindfulness exercises," massage, yoga, meditation, and breathing exercises. All told, the institute is spending $4.1 million for studies involving alternative medicine, or about 3.5 percent of its funding to date on this type of study. Findings from this research could become significant, since many alternative medicine therapies have not yet faced rigorous scientific testing -- a key prerequisite for getting insurance companies to pay for them. Potentially the most far-reaching provision, however, is Section 2706. Alternative-medicine advocates say this section stipulates that as long as an alternative-medicine practitioner is fully licensed by a state, insurance companies must reimburse them just as they do medical doctors. (Literally, the section says that "a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall not discriminate with respect to participation under the plan or coverage against any health care provider who is acting within the scope of that provider's license or certification under applicable state law.") Put all of these elements together and Goldberg has a point. Where the claim overstates the case That said, it’s important to note some limitations in how the health care law is treating alternative medicine in practice, rather than in theory. For starters, the first four provisions cited above are heavier on symbolism than practical impact. They involve things like pilot programs, advisory committees and optional extensions of definitions to include alternative-medicine practitioners. The research being conducted could ultimately make a difference, but it’s still a small portion of the institute’s portfolio. Most importantly, the most sweeping of the half dozen provisions -- the changes to reimbursement policy prompted by Section 2706 -- hasn’t yet turned into a boon for alternative-medicine practitioners. In states like California, Hawaii, Montana and Rhode Island, lawmakers have offered bills that would enshrine the language of Section 2706. But they have not become law yet. Meanwhile, the federal Department of Health and Human Services has thrown cold water on advocates’ most sweeping visions. Perhaps influenced by pushback from traditional medical disciplines, HHS issued guidance that says, in part, "This provision (2706) does not require plans or issuers to accept all types of providers into a network." Alyssa Wostrel, executive director of the Integrative Healthcare Policy Consortium, calls the HHS guidance "faulty," and Harkin (who’s now retired from the Senate) and other advocates have sought to reverse it. But for now, the HHS guidance seems to be having a chilling effect on the expansion of alternative-medicine coverage. Our ruling Goldberg wrote that homeopathy, acupuncture and aromatherapy "have been given elevated legitimacy under the Affordable Care Act." The law does provide a leg up for alternative therapies (although it’s unclear whether homeopathy and aromatherapy would ultimately benefit). In practice, though, it’s important not to oversell the impact. Most of the provisions in question are modest, and the one with potentially the biggest impact has been curbed by a subsequent guidance from HHS. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Jonah Goldberg	None	None	None	2015-02-24T14:16:46	2015-02-13	['None']
pomt-00464	Says Democratic challenger Gina Ortiz Jones has raised "more money from Massachusetts than" from Texas.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2018/aug/15/will-hurd/will-hurd-way-foe-getting-way-more-money-massachus/	A Republican Texas congressman whose campaign has raised less money than his Democratic challenger says his opponent gathered a disturbing share of her receipts from that chilly faraway state where they park the car in Harvard Yard. An Aug. 8, 2018, San Antonio Express-News rundown of the race between Rep. Will Hurd of Helotes and Democratic nominee Gina Ortiz Jones quotes Hurd saying of Jones: "When you raise more money from Massachusetts than you do from Texas, that is not a good indication of your broad-based support." Generally, the story also says, Jones, of San Antonio, outraised Hurd almost 2-1 in the second quarter of 2018, gathering $1.2 million to Hurd’s $684,000. Was Hurd right that Jones has raised more money from Massachusetts--about a 30-hour drive from the San Antonio-and-west 23rd Congressional District of Texas--than from Texas? We wondered. Hurd aide cites second-quarter figures To our inquiry, Connor Pfeiffer of Hurd’s campaign said by email that he downloaded campaign finance reports from the Federal Election Commission and then winnowed second-quarter donations to Jones’ campaign from individuals and PACs in the two states--which showed, Pfeiffer said, that Jones got nearly $730,000 from backers in the Bay State and nearly $367,000 from Texas donors. More than $500,000 via ActBlue? Off the bat, we noticed that Hurd’s analysis counts donations made by individuals to the Jones campaign via the ActBlue PAC, based in Somerville, Mass., as originating in Massachusetts. Pfeiffer said: "I counted the money Jones received from ActBlue as receipts from the state of Massachusetts because ActBlue is a PAC in Massachusetts." However, ActBlue doesn’t make candidate donations. Rather, Democratic aspirants and groups use the PAC’s online tools to manage donations from all over the country. The PAC says on its website that it "acts as a conduit federally and in most states, which means we provide the infrastructure for campaigns and organizations to fundraise online, but we don’t fundraise on behalf of anyone." By Pfeiffer’s accounting, donations made to Jones’s campaign via ActBlue amounted to more than $581,000 of what Hurd considers Massachusetts donations. Not counting that money reduces Jones’s Massachusetts haul to such an extent that the result appears to be, by Hurd's accounting, more than $200,000 less than what Hurd says Jones raised in Texas. Longer view And that result, we recognized, considers only the latest three months of donations reported by Jones to the FEC. For a longer view, we inquired into how much Jones has reaped in contributions reported throughout her campaign by asking the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance issues. A center analyst, Douglas Weber, replied that by its sort of itemized donations by individuals reported by Jones to the FEC, her campaign through June 2018 had raised $193,879 from Massachusetts residents and $353,293 from Texas residents. "We generally do not count PAC contributions," Weber said by email, "as many PACs are based in the D.C. area regardless of the organization." Weber, asked about Hurd’s camp folding in donations conveyed through the ActBlue PAC, commented: "They shouldn't include anything from ActBlue. ActBlue is a conduit--the address may be in Massachusetts but that's not where the contributions came from." Separately, Judith Ingram, an FEC press officer, responding to our inquiry by checking Jones’s filed reports for donations fielded in each state. Ingram emailed us spreadsheets showing Jones getting $339,599 from more than 800 Texas donors and drawing $117,950 from more than 120 Massachusetts donors--with PACs not included in her tallies. With help from Ingram, we sifted the Ingram-presented donations to Jones to find that through June 2018, $36,150 of her donations from Massachusett residents flowed through the ActBlue PAC along with $167,593 of her contributions from Texans. Put another way, it looked to us like hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to Jones that Hurd attributed to Massachusetts residents came, via ActBlue, from people not living in Texas or Massachusetts. Pfeiffer, Hurd's spokesman, indicated by email that Hurd stands by what he said. Pfeiffer wrote: "Based on the congressman's quote, the relevant question here is whether more money is flowing to Jones from Massachusetts than Texas. Jones is receiving a large amount of money from ActBlue, which is based in Massachusetts. What type of PAC ActBlue is does not change where they are based or the proximate source of the money flowing to Jones' campaign," Pfeiffer said. Our ruling Hurd said Jones has raised "more money from Massachusetts than" from Texas. To the contrary, records show Jones raising more in campaign funds from Texans than Massachusetts residents. The congressman’s analysis erroneously rests on counting donations ferried to Jones from donors all over the country through the Massachusetts-based ActBlue PAC as contributions made solely by people living in Massachusetts. We find Hurd's statement incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-00266	"While southern Illinois families struggled," Mike Bost "voted to raise his own pay."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/oct/03/brendan-kelly/illinois-brendan-kelly-wants-cash-mike-bost-vote/	In Washington, Mike Bost has agreed consistently that Congress members, earning $174,00 a year, don’t need a pay raise. But the Illinois Republican spent two decades in his state’s General Assembly before his 2014 election to Congress, and in one of those years -- 11 years ago -- he voted for a 9.6 percent pay raise for state lawmakers. You can guess where this is going. "While southern Illinois families struggled, Bost voted to raise his own pay." So said a campaign ad from his Democratic challenger, Brendan Kelly. Is this true? The suggestion is that Bost took care of himself and his lawmaker friends rather than the taxpayers. But Bost’s record of voting against pay raises is much longer. The single vote In 2007, the Illinois General Assembly was trying to pass a 75-page, multipart supplemental spending bill to fund schools, multiple state agencies and employee salaries. By the time it came up for a final vote, other lawmakers had included a measure to raise the assembly’s pay, with rank-and-file members’ salaries rising to $63,143 from $57,619. The Legislature had not received a raise, even one to cover cost-of-living increases, in several years, but this was controversial nevertheless because of claims that the state had bigger priorities, and limited resources. Supporters of the bill said its passage was essential -- not because of the pay raise but because the underlying bill contained multiple other state funding measures. That’s why Bost said he voted yes. He had voted no the previous year on a similar measure with a proposed 9.6 percent pay hike. Bost had also voted against pay raises numerous other times, his campaign and Illinois media said. WSIL-TV, an Illinois ABC affiliate, reported that while in the Illinois Legislature, "Bost voted against pay increases for lawmakers more than a dozen times, and even voted to require furlough days for legislators, actually reducing compensation." The Belleville News-Democrat, examining Illinois General Assembly documents, found the same thing in its own examination. Now in Congress nearly four years, Bost has voted to freeze congressional pay 12 times. The number of votes exceeds his time in Congress because annual spending bills typically go through several stages, requiring several votes. A nuance This is about pay raises, but inflation-linked cost-of-living, or COLA, increases are also a form of a raise. Unless blocked by the Legislature, Illinois grants COLA adjustments automatically, a result of an independent compensation board’s decision decades ago. When counting votes against pay raises, Bost and the Illinois media generally include Bost’s multiple votes to skip the COLA hikes But there was an instance in 2010, confirmed by PolitiFact in Illinois legislative records, when Bost voted yes on a floor amendment to suspend a COLA hike and require legislators to take 12 furlough days -- yet when the measure got attached to a much broader budget bill, Bost voted no on that bill. He said he could not support the bill other reasons. Technically speaking, that meant he voted against the final legislators' COLA freeze and furlough. The same pay provisions came up the next year, however, in a clean bill pertaining only to lawmaker compensation -- and Bost voted for the cuts. Our ruling Kelly's ad says Bost "voted to raise his own pay." There is one 2007 vote that is not in question. Bost’s campaign spokesman said Bost voted for the bill despite that distasteful element, because so many other provisions were essential for the state. But Bost voted repeatedly against other pay hikes -- not only the COLAs but a 9.6 percent proposed pay hike in a 2006 bill as well. If counting, those votes outnumbered the 2007 vote. Looking at his overall record gives a very different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01084	Says. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, once said, "Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/15/facebook-posts/widely-shared-meme-oversimplifies-joe-bartons-2009/	Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, is not popular among environmentalists. A former chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, Barton is a staunch advocate for fossil fuels and expressed skepticism about the role of manmade carbon emissions in climate change. Barton’s critics like to paint him as blindly supportive of Big Oil and as anti-science. Exhibit A is a series of social media memes that mock him for suggesting that wind power can actually intensify global warming. The most extreme version we found said Barton had claimed that "wind power would stop the Earth from rotating." That’s clearly not true, but it’s also not clear that this claim was meant to be taken seriously. Instead, we decided to check a less outrageous -- and more common -- meme mocking Barton. A reader recently sent us a meme featuring a picture of Barton alongside the quotation, "Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up." The meme’s creator went on to comment, "The only thing more stupid than this idiot heading the House-Senate energy conf(erence) is Michelle Bachmann's stint on the House 'Intelligence' Committee!" (Michele Bachmann's name is misspelled.) Ultimately, we concluded that Barton’s words were significantly altered. What did Barton actually say? As it turns out, the comments from the meme we’re checking stem from a congressional hearing held almost six years ago, on Feb. 26, 2009. As part of a lengthy question-and-answer session, Barton pressed witnesses on some of the risks of shifting the nation’s energy portfolio from fossil fuels to renewable sources. In one exchange, Barton referred to a paper by Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and a professor of technology at the Tepper School of Business. In turn, Apt’s paper relied on research in an earlier paper by David W. Keith, currently a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard University. Barton’s off-the-cuff comments are somewhat meandering, but the general gist of what he said was to raise questions about some of the downsides of using wind to generate electricity. "I am going to read a paragraph which is, if true, very ironic. And this is from Dr. Apt’s paper, and I quote: ‘Wind energy is a finite resource. At large scale, slowing down the wind by using its energy to turn turbines has environmental consequences. A group of researchers at Princeton University … found that wind farms may change the mixing of air near the surface, drying the soil near the site. At planetary scales, David Keith, who was then at Carnegie Mellon, and coworkers found that if wind supplied 10 percent of expected global electricity demand in 2100 … the resulting change in the earth’s atmospheric energy might cause some regions of the world to experience temperature change of approximately 1 degree Centigrade.’ … "Now, wind is God’s way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it is hotter to areas where it is cooler. That is what wind is. Wouldn’t it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up? Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the massive scale. I mean, it does make some sense. You stop something. You can’t transfer that heat and the heat goes up. It is just something to think about." Reading the full text shows that the meme glossed over some important nuances, perhaps by relying on a brief summation published by Time magazine in 2010. First, even though the meme used quotation marks to frame the comment as a single, unified quote, it’s actually a stitched-together mix of several snippets from Barton’s remarks. Second, the meme ignores that when Barton said that "wind is a finite resource," he was explicitly quoting Apt’s paper, rather than saying that was his personal belief. Third, the meme overlooks that when Barton supposedly said that harnessing the wind "would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up," he was actually asking the witness a question rather than stating his view. And fourth, the meme ignores that Barton said in the same exchange, "Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman." In other words, what he was doing was posing a scenario to be discussed further. So, while Barton’s comments clearly show an openness to the ideas he addressed, the meme is off-base in suggesting that Barton was stating his own opinion. For the record, Barton’s spokesman, Sean Brown, told PolitiFact that the congressman "believes in an all-of-the-above energy plan that includes wind and solar power but also doesn’t ignore traditional sources of energy like coal or natural gas." Is there any credibility to the idea that wind energy might contribute to global warming? So Barton didn’t say what the meme said he did. But what about the substance of the claim -- that wind turbines can exacerbate global warming? The idea isn’t entirely out of left field, but it’s a lot more complicated than it seems on the surface. Let’s start with what was known at the time Barton made his comment six years ago. The paper ultimately referenced by Barton -- the one that Keith coauthored -- found some intriguing interactions between wind turbines and climate, namely that "very large amounts of wind power" can produce changes to climate "at continental scales." However, the authors leavened this assessment with a more optimistic note -- that such changes in climate disappear at the global level, and that, on balance, using wind power rather than fossil fuels reduces climate change, rather than exacerbating it. Keith, who didn’t respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact, and his coauthors also emphasized that what negative impacts emerged from wind-turbine use could be eased, fairly economically, by better turbine design and placement. Subsequent research has bolstered this conclusion. A 2012 study that used satellite data for west-central Texas, published in Nature Climate Change and co-authored by Liming Zhou of the State University of New York at Albany, found a "significant warming trend" of up to 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit per decade over wind farms, compared to nearby regions that didn’t have wind farms. However, Zhou told the Daily Telegraph that the climatic changes from wind farms paled when compared to the impact of manmade global warming. And Mark Z. Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering, told PolitiFact that a 2012 paper he coauthored found that the impact of large arrays of wind turbines would be to cool climate -- not warm it. "That paper is the most detailed to date," Jacobson said. Jacobson agreed that even installing enough wind-power capacity to power "half the world" would have "small" global impacts on climate, even though the impacts locally could be more significant. If you weigh the negatives of wind power against the negatives of fossil-fuel use, he added, "there is only a net benefit of switching to wind." Our ruling A social media meme says Barton once said, "Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up." Barton raised that possibility while questioning a witness during a 2009 congressional hearing, but contrary to the meme’s implication, he did not say that it was his personal belief. Rather, the meme makes fun of Barton by stitching together parts of his comments in a way that is misleading. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03001	Congressional lawmakers earn their salaries "FOR LIFE," which for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would add up to "$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/17/chain-email/chain-email-says-lawmakers-earn-salaries-life-whic/	Okay, people, let’s chat from the heart for a second. Congressional approval ratings nearing single digits and government shutdowns do not make viral rants about lawmakers’ pay any more true. If your in-box claims to share shocking truths in ALL-CAPS underlined exclamations!! — take your hand off the mouse button. Do not click Forward. Unless, of course, it’s to your favorite fact-checkers. Take this recent example sent by one of you to truthometer@politifact.com: Subject: Obscene Salaries - Pass this on if you believe this is all wrong Salary of retired US Presidents .$180,000 FOR LIFE Salary of House/Senate....$174,000 FOR LIFE This is stupid Salary of Speaker of the House ....$223,500 FOR LIFE! This is really stupid Salary of Majority/Minority Leader $193,400 FOR LIFE Ditto last line Average Salary of a teacher .. $40,065 Average Salary of Soldier DEPLOYED IN AFGHANISTAN .. $38,000 Think about this. Nancy Pelosi will retire as a Congress Person at $174,000 Dollars a year for LIFE. She has retired as SPEAKER at $223,500 a year. PLUS she will receive an additional $193,400 a year as Minority Leader. That's $803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical which is not available to us ... the taxpayers. She is just one of the hundreds of Senators and Congress that float in and out every year! I think we found where the cuts should be made! If you agree ..... pass it on, I just did. In honor of Congress’ second-worst approval rating in Gallup history, let’s keep this simple: Do congressional lawmakers earn their salaries "FOR LIFE? Would House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi get "$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical"? No. And really, really, really, no. We’ll break it down. Do congressional lawmakers earn their salaries "FOR LIFE? Let’s turn to the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the Congressional Research Service, which explains laws so even lawmakers can understand them. • Members of Congress earn their $174,000 salaries only during their elected terms. (Nope, not for life.) • They’re eligible for congressional pensions only after five years of service. (For a member of the House, that would mean getting elected to office at least three times.) Those pensions can’t be tapped until retirement age — and can’t be collected while a lawmaker still gets a federal salary. So John Kerry, for example, can’t collect his congressional pension while he serves as secretary of state, according to Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union. • The size of the pension depends on years of service and the average of a lawmaker’s highest three years of salary. The exact formula depends on when they started. Meanwhile, every paycheck, lawmakers contribute to both their pensions and Social Security. • Most congressional pensions are nowhere near a lawmaker’s salary. Under a pre-1984 retirement formula, it couldn’t be more than 80 percent of a lawmaker’s final salary, not counting cost-of-living adjustments. Under current rules, lawmakers could theoretically get more than 80 percent of their salary, but most would need to serve more than 66 years to get that. Would House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi get "$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical"? The email writer gets a whole host of things wrong here. The message claims Pelosi will retire as a member of Congress making $174,000 — and that she’ll earn it annually, for life, on top of her full speaker’s salary of $223,500 and minority leader’s salary of $193,400, for a whopping "$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical." Nope. Congressional leaders do get paid more than other lawmakers. The speaker of the House earns $223,500. The House minority leader earns $193,400. That’s more than the $174,000 earned by the rank and file. But those are annual salaries that leaders earn while they hold their titles, not lifetime guarantees that get stacked on top of one another. • First, even if her pension did equal all three salaries, they add up to $590,900, not $803,700. (Unless perhaps the writer’s suggesting the "free medical" is worth $212,800 a year. Talk about rising health care costs!) • Second, that’s not how it works. See above. • Third, lawmakers don’t get "free medical." They pay a portion of their health insurance premiums, co-pays and co-insurance and can face a deductible, just like a lot of workers with employer-based health care. In January, their employer-offered health insurance will be a choice of plans offered on Obamacare’s federal exchange. Pelosi’s higher salary as House speaker from 2007-11 will boost her pension. But the congresswoman, who’s been in office since 1987, would have to work at least two more decades for her starting pension to match a regular lawmaker’s pay, much less $803,700. She’s 73. And, oh, by the way, lawmakers haven’t given themselves a pay raise since January 2009. We’re not saying they’re earning their keep. But perhaps it’ll make you feel slightly better that their salaries this year hit their lowest inflation-adjusted levels since December 1990. And that more than 200 of them were refusing pay while the government was closed. Our ruling A viral message claims congressional lawmakers earn their salaries "FOR LIFE," which for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would add up to "$803,700 Dollars a year for LIFE including FREE medical." Lawmakers don’t earn a salary after their terms end. They may earn pensions based on years of service, but those don’t start until retirement. They don’t get "free medical." It might feel good to click Forward. But it wouldn’t make this claim any less Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2013-10-17T11:48:31	2013-10-15	['Nancy_Pelosi', 'United_States_Congress']

pomt-08585	"Austin politicians want to cram more kids into classrooms so they don't have to make the tough decisions to balance the budget."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/25/kendra-yarbrough-camarena/kendra-yarbrough-camarena-democrat-texas-house-say/	Democrat Kendra Yarbrough Camarena, challenging Republican state Rep. Dwayne Bohac of Houston, vows to battle to keep classes small in elementary schools. In a TV ad that debuted online Sept. 14, Camarena says: "Austin politicians want to cram more kids into classrooms so they don't have to make the tough decisions to balance the budget." Politicians dodging tough budget decisions by crowding schoolrooms? We wanted a refresher on both parts of that. To our inquiry, Camarena's campaign manager, Mary Bell, said "Austin politicians" refers to Republican legislators. Bell said the ad's statement is based on a plank in the Republican Party of Texas' 2010 platform and a May 10 news article in the Dallas Morning News. In a section headlined "Legislative Priorities," the platform says: "Create flexibility for school districts under the class size limit mandate." That's a reference to state law approved in 1984 pinning the permitted ratio of students to teachers from kindergarten through fourth grade in Texas public schools at 22-to-1. The Morning News article says a special House-Senate legislative committee studying education finance in advance of the 2011 legislative session is looking at easing the mandate, which came into place with a raft of changes, including the requirement that students pass classes to participate in extracurricular activities. The newspaper article quotes state Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, and state Rep. Rob Eissler, R-The Woodlands, the panel's co-chairs, saying it might be time to change the mandate in the face of an expected state funding shortfall. Currently, the newspaper reported, every time a class exceeds the 22-student limit, districts must create an additional class, meaning an additional teacher and classroom, though districts can request waivers. One special committee member, Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, is quoted saying the limit costs school districts millions of dollars annually despite a lack of evidence it boosts achievement; he's described as favoring an average class size that schools would have to adhere to, leaving the size of each class up to local administrators. Patrick recently told us he expects his proposal to gain traction in the 2011 session. Representatives of teacher groups, which oppose larger classes, are quoted in the newspaper article saying the limit has fed improvements in student performance. They note that school districts already can and do request waivers for individual campuses. Seeking to gauge if changing the mandate is likely, we checked on whether the Select Committee on Public School Finance Weights, Allotments & Adjustments has reached its legislative recommendations. It has not, Eissler told us in an interview, nor is it certain the panel will revisit the class-size mandate. He said, though, he's mulling his own proposal to offer bonuses to high-quality teachers who volunteer to teach more than 22 students. "School districts could save money on additional classrooms, good teachers would get more money, more kids would get exposed to the better teachers," Eissler said. "At times (of fiscal pressure) like these, you have to explore a lot of things," he said. Next, we reached Shapiro, who said school superintendents have urged lawmakers to relax the 22-1 mandate, perhaps (as Patrick proposes) by allowing districts to average 22 students per teacher in kindergarten through fourth grade. Of Camarena's statement, Shapiro said: "We're certainly not going to cram anybody into a classroom. That's an exaggeration," she said, which leaves the impression of students not getting tasks done in a room without a desk per child. Eissler and Shapiro bridled at the second part of Camarena's statement, that loosening the class-size mandate means lawmakers "don't have to make the tough decisions to balance the budget." Shapiro pointed out such a relaxation would only affect local district spending--not the strapped state budget. State education aid goes to school districts based largely on the number of students they serve, not how many classes are taught at each school. On another front, we wondered if superintendents favor changes to the 22-1 mandate. Spokeswoman Jenny Caputo of the Texas Association of School Administrators, whose membership includes most superintendents, said in an e-mail the group doesn't have an official stance on the issue, and the membership is pretty evenly divided on whether the law should be changed. Relaxing the standard, Caputo writes, is "a tough sell -- even if a bill could get passed, which isn't likely, parents would certainly fight it and having larger-than-average class sizes is not something that attracts teachers in droves to your district either." Separately, Clay Robison, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, said teachers want to keep the class-size cap. "It's very popular not only with teachers -- it's very popular with parents," Robison said. "Parents don't like putting their kids, particularly their young kids, in crowded classrooms." Upshot: A Republican state senator says the 22-student limit for elementary grade classes should be eased to give local school administrators leeway to set class sizes. Lawmakers who helm a special Senate-House education committee each say the idea could gain support. However, none of the trio -- Patrick, Shapiro, Eissler -- concede the goal is to "cram more kids into classrooms," as Camarena says. The second part of Camerena's statement, that changing the size limit is a way for politicians to avoid making "the tough decisions to balance the budget," isn't supported. Notably, any budgetary boon from changing the limit would be enjoyed by school districts, not the state. Still, it could end up that more than 22 children are placed in some classrooms. We rate Camarena's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13312	"The world's 62 richest people own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/07/oxfam-america/oxfam-worlds-62-richest-own-much-poorest-36-billio/	Some of the starkest statistics we see center around income inequality. A recent post from Oxfam America, the U.S. branch of the global anti-poverty group, particularly piqued our interest. Oxfam wants the presidential candidates to tackle the issue in their upcoming debate. "The world's 62 richest people own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest. What will you do to combat runaway inequality in the US and around the world?" Oxfam America asked on Twitter. Is that so? It turns out Oxfam America isn’t quite right. But the number is in the ballpark. Oxfam came up with the comparison in January using two different reports. The first, from Credit Suisse, estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide. The second was Forbes’ list of billionaires. We'll walk you through the calculations and a couple of caveats. The Credit Suisse report Analysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated total personal wealth at $250 trillion. From there, they estimated that the bottom half of the world’s population (approximately 3.6 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. To be precise, (and you can find this on page 110 of the full Credit Suisse databook) the bottom half of the world’s population own .59 percent of world household wealth, which comes out to about $1.4 trillion. There are some caveats about the calculation. Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said that Credit Suisse may have underestimated wealth in low-income countries but not enough to make the numbers much different. The strongest criticism of the Credit Suisse report is that it includes a significant number of people in wealthy countries who are not poor but have large debts. That produces misleading results, experts told us. "(They) are not actually living in poverty but simply have very low or even negative net worth due to amassment of debt to finance housing, education and consumption beyond current income," Brent Beardsley, managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, said. "In this case, wealth -- or rather net worth -- is not an adequate measure of what is commonly understood as poverty." Forbes billionaire estimates The second half of the comparison is relatively straightforward. Oxfam used Forbes' list of billionaires and counted how many people it would take to reach $1.4 trillion -- the figure representing the wealth of the bottom half of the global population. Forbes' calculations aren't perfect, but they are the best estimate publicly available. Forbes tracks changes in real time, but the base comparisons depend on estimates generated by members of the Forbes team. Sometimes the billionaires themselves say the numbers are off, because all the necessary information is not public knowledge. Then there are fluctuations due to changing currency exchange rates and the ups and downs of the stock market. The list can’t deliver pinpoint accuracy, but it does represent a good faith effort to assess the net worth of the world’s wealthiest people. Like the wealth calculations in the Credit Suisse report, it should be seen as a reasonable estimate. So what does Forbes say today, about 10 months after Oxfam wrote its report? According to the publisher, the world’s wealthiest 54 people control $1.4 trillion -- the same amount attributed to the combined wealth of the bottom 50 percent of people living in the world. Our ruling Oxfam America said the world's 62 richest people own the same wealth as the 3.6 billion poorest. The Oxfam analysis was based on a report from Credit Suisse and the Forbes list of billionaires. The exact number of billionaires might well be different from the 62 that Oxfam said. But out of world population of 7.3 billion, it makes little difference if the tally were 100. It still represents a tiny sliver of a percentage of the people in the world.

pomt-01990	"At the beginning of World War II, we had a relatively small army, smaller than Portugal’s."	true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/13/ken-paxton/us-army-was-smaller-army-portugal-world-war-ii/	History shows Texas has an opportunity to fend off President Barack Obama’s "attacks on our liberty," Ken Paxton, the Republican nominee for attorney general of Texas, told his party’s state convention this month. Paxton, a McKinney state senator, didn’t call for a Texas-wide arms build-up, but he offered an analogy to war. "Think about the greatest generation and World War II," Paxton said. "At the beginning of World War II, we had a relatively small army ... smaller than Portugal’s. And yet we put together a military that fought on two fronts against two great superpowers. In the midst of dire circumstances," Paxton said, adding: "Texas has that same opportunity." The mighty USA had a pre-war army smaller than comparable forces in Portugal? To our inquiry, Paxton consultant Anthony Holm pointed out a historian’s July 22, 2010, article on President Franklin Roosevelt and Great Britain in WW II. David Woolner wrote that in June 1939, which was three months before England declared war on Germany, "the roughly 180,000-man U.S. Army ranked 19th in the world--smaller than Portugal’s!" Woolner continued: "To bolster America’s security, FDR not only called for an increase in the size of the nation’s military budget, and the repeal of the arms embargo provisions within the 1930s neutrality legislation, he also quietly sought to strengthen America’s ties with Great Britain--the one nation whose combined military, political and economic strength might serve as a bulwark against a possible Axis aggression in the Western Hemisphere." Woolner, a senior fellow at the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, told us by email his pre-war comparison to Portugal has appeared in many books over decades. "I should also point out here that the small size of the U.S. Army in 1938-39 is sometimes referenced as being ranked 17th in the world, sometimes listed as smaller than Belgium, etc. it depends to a certain extent when the comparison is being made.," Woolner said. "The main point is that in the interwar years, the U.S. Congress and public were very isolationist, and the United States was not the same sort of world leader it is today. That change came under Franklin Roosevelt, who orchestrated the largest military build-up in world history." Some online searching led us to the Army’s compilation of Gen. George C. Marshall’s reports on the Army’s progress during the war, covering July 1939 through June 1945. Marshall, who was later secretary of state, was the Army’s chief of staff. The foreword says: "For the feat of transforming the miniscule interwar Army to the great force that defeated the Axis in Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and Asia, no one could claim more credit than Marshall. When he took office, the 174,000-man U.S. Army ranked nineteenth in size in the world, behind Portugal and only slightly ahead of Bulgaria. Its half-strength divisions were scattered among numerous posts, its equipment obsolete, its reliance on the horse increasingly anachronistic." We also reached out to the U.S Army Center of Military History at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. By email, the center’s James Tobias provided a document tallying active-duty U.S. Army soldiers year by year from 1930 into 2011. According to the document, there were 187,893 active-duty Army soldiers as of June 30, 1939; the army ballooned to nearly 8.3 million active-duty soldiers, its record high, by the end of May 1945. Our ruling Paxton told delegates: "At the beginning of World War II, we had a relatively small army, smaller than Portugal’s." The U.S. Army was relatively small at the war’s outset and the army itself has said the army was smaller than the army for Portugal. We rate this statement as True.

pomt-03268	Says Florida refused to allow the insurance commissioner to "negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high" under Obamacare.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/08/ted-deutch/florida-democrats-say-gov-rick-scott-and-legislatu/	Florida lawmakers have left the state vulnerable to unreasonably high insurance premiums in an effort to undermine Obamacare, say the state’s U.S. House Democrats. Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature cynically stripped Florida of its ability to review rates for the law’s rollout, U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch writes in a letter signed by all 10 of the state’s Democratic representatives. The letter, which appeals to the federal government to step in on Floridians’ behalf, blames a law Scott signed at the end of May for refusing to allow the state insurance commissioner to "negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high." It asks the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to "protect Florida consumers — since Gov. Scott, the Florida Legislature and Insurance Commissioner (Kevin) McCarty will not." Did the governor and state legislators prevent the insurance commissioner from negotiating lower rates and refusing high ones? Deferring to the feds Legislators faced a unique challenge during their 60-day session in 2013. Unlike many states that had laid groundwork to implement the Affordable Care Act since it became law in 2010, Florida had repeatedly refused — first challenging the constitutionality of the law, then waiting to see if a new president would offer a reprieve. But with the law upheld by the Supreme Court and President Barack Obama back in office, the state was stuck. It had refused federal money to help with the transition. Now it was also running out of time. A state Senate committee in 2013 said it sought a "rational, reasonable approach." State law needed an update to match federal requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The committee sought to do as little as possible. "We want to make sure that we're in compliance, that we're doing what we're required to do," said Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, at a March committee meeting. The Affordable Care Act assumed that states would continue to take a lead role in setting insurance rates, just as Florida had done in the past. It encouraged states to strengthen their rate-setting authority, offering millions of dollars in grant money to help. But it didn’t require that. The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation faced a serious time-crunch to get up to speed on a host of new requirements under the law. Legislators offered a compromise. If the federal government wanted to impose new coverage requirements — well, it could set rates, too. "Since the federal government is requiring these additional coverages that will cost more," said Sen. Joe Negron, Republican chair of the Affordable Care Act Committee, "then to me it makes sense for them to be responsible for approving rate increases that are certain to come." Democrats on the committee agreed with this approach at its final meeting on March 18. "I think we're going to find it's going to cost us a lot of money to set rates here in Florida," said Sen. Eleanor Sobel. "... I think we should rely on the federal government." She expressed confidence the federal government would have a "greater wealth of knowledge." "If we have concerns about the rates that the feds do set, then we should work with them," she said. One hitch she didn’t mention: the federal government didn’t give itself rate-making authority. What resulted was Florida Senate Bill 1842, which among other things, suspended for two years the requirement that insurers get state approval for rates for new plans — such as those that will appear on new marketplaces. Companies would still have to file rate changes with the state. But they could act on those changes without approval. Sobel now says that wasn’t at all clear at the time. The bill earned unanimous support from the Senate Appropriations Committee, then passed the Senate 28-8, mostly along party lines. Six senators voted after roll call, including Sobel, who changed her vote from yea to nay. "I was reading very quickly. Then I realized this was something that was not good for the people of the state of Florida," she said. The 78-36 House vote also mostly followed party lines, with a few Democratic supporters. Gov. Scott expressed the same confidence that the federal government would step in. When he signed the bill into law May 31, he wrote, "I support the Legislature's deference to the federal government. ... Rates for the new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period." Limits of federal authority Here’s the thing: The federal government, even under the Affordable Care Act, can’t do what Insurance Commissioner McCarty can do. Florida grants its insurance commissioner a range of powers. McCarty can negotiate lower rates with companies. He can refuse rates that the state determines to be too high. The federal government can do neither of those things. On July 31, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation released projected insurance premiums for policies that will be for sale on the new health insurance marketplaces launching in January 2014 — premiums it has no authority to review. The state estimated rate increases in the individual market between 8 percent and 59 percent. (The federal government and consumer groups, we should note, dispute the state's projections, with one group suggesting they're inaccurately and irresponsibly high to discourage Floridians from participating in Obamacare.) In a bulleted list, the office noted all of the ways the Affordable Care Act might be driving up costs. It didn’t mention McCarty had no power to negotiate or refuse because of the new law. And that matters. A Kaiser Family Foundation study in 2010 found that those states with robust authority to approve or disapprove rates were "able to extract significant reductions." While Florida used the Affordable Care Act as a reason to reduce its rate oversight, most states used the law’s grants to boost theirs. North Carolina reduced a rate increase request with its new authority in 2010 that saved beneficiaries $14.5 million. The Palm Beach Post noted that Maryland used its negotiating power to push rates for next year’s premiums down "by as much as a third" from what companies had proposed. In the absence of oversight from Florida, the federal government does have some power to protect Florida consumers from outrageous rates — even if it can’t rescind them or otherwise impose penalties. Chief is the new requirement that insurers must spend at least 80 percent or 85 percent of premiums on medical care, or pay rebates. So, if an insurer filed for a rate increase that granted it profits far beyond the benefits it offered, it would owe consumers a rebate the next year. Second, it could refuse to let an insurer sell its product on Florida’s federally run marketplace. But not all insurance will be sold through the marketplace. Meanwhile, the process was supposed to rely on states’ determination of whether a rate was justified. Lastly, it wields shame. If Florida doesn’t weigh in, the federal government will review any increase greater than 10 percent to evaluate whether it’s unreasonable — a designation the insurer will have to feature on its website. Our ruling A letter from Deutch and Florida’s U.S. House Democrats says that the governor and legislators refused to allow the state insurance commissioner to "negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high." They did precisely that, though they argued that the federal government could step in on Florida’s behalf. It turns out, that’s not how it works. Deutch’s claim about the state’s temporarily diminished powers is True.	None	Ted Deutch	None	None	None	2013-08-08T12:22:59	2013-08-01	['None']
pomt-09390	In Cover Florida "thousands already enrolled and climbing."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/25/charlie-crist/crist-claims-cover-florida-benefits-thousands/	Gov. Charlie Crist has repeatedly boasted about Cover Florida, a health insurance program for Floridians who lack coverage. A few days after the U.S. House approved the health care plan, Crist ran a radio ad criticizing that plan as "Washington liberals forcing government takeover of health care" and touting Florida's own program. "But in Florida," the narrator says, "one leader already enacted common sense conservative solutions: Charlie Crist. As governor, Crist passed Cover Florida. Now Floridians can take charge of their own health care through market-based strategies. Thousands already enrolled and climbing." Health coverage is a major issue in Florida because about 20 percent of Floridians lack insurance -- about 3.6 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Before we analyze Crist's claim about the Cover Florida enrollment figures, it's helpful to know some basics about the program. Crist signed Cover Florida into law in May 2008, but enrollment did not begin until January 2009, according to the Agency for Health Care Administration. Floridians who have lacked health insurance for at least six months or are recently unemployed are eligible. The program offers coverage from six different health insurance companies with either catasrophic coverage that includes hospital stays or a more pared-down plan without hospitalization benefits. The Cover Florida Web site boasts that insurance can be purchased for as little as $23.70 a month, but monthly rates vary depending on level of coverage and other factors such as age and gender. For example in Broward County, the average monthly rate ranges from $50.75 with no emergency or hospital services, to $327.27 for more coverage. "This legislation makes affordable health coverage available to 3.8 million uninsured Floridians through a comprehensive market-based strategy," according to the Cover Florida Web site. Now, a look at the enrollment figures. Crist's claim -- "thousands already enrolled and climbing" -- suggests it is a large initiative with significant growth. But for a state with about 3.6 million uninsured, the enrollment numbers are tiny and the growth is modest. They went from 952 in January/February of 2009 to 5,426 in December 2009, the most recent numbers available. The program added roughly 750 people per month in the first few months, but the growth slowed to only 180 from November to December. So the numbers have gone up, but they remain a tiny percentage of of the uninsured -- about 0.1 percent of all the uninsured Floridians. "It's such a miniscule number and it's just definitely not the answer to getting millions of Floridians insured,'' said Democratic state Sen. Nan Rich of Weston, vice chair of the health and human services appropriations committee. "It's clear people do not see it as the answer for providing access. I don't want to totally disregard it, some people are in it." Technically, Crist is correct: "thousands" have already enrolled -- but barely more than 5 . . . thousands. And he is also technically correct to say enrollment is "climbing" because the number of participants has grown every month. Yet we think listeners of Crist's radio ad will get the impression that their governor has introduced a large program that is growing rapidly and making significant progress in covering Florida's 3.6 million uninsured. But it's a tiny effort that is growing a small amount. We find his claim Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-03-25T18:33:18	2010-03-24	['None']

pomt-12718	"Florida pays our teachers $10,000 a year less than the national average."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/07/janet-cruz/how-much-does-florida-teacher-pay-lag-behind-natio/	If Republican leaders want to attract good-paying jobs to Florida, House Democratic Leader Janet Cruz says that they should start with well-funded public schools. Cruz said Florida should invest in public school teachers in her response to Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s annual speech opening the Legislature’s two-month session. "The right thing is to just give teachers a raise," said Cruz, who represents Tampa. "It is embarrassing and I am ashamed that Florida pays our teachers $10,000 a year less than the national average. We are one of the largest states in the country. If we continue to recruit and retain the most talented people to educate our children, it starts with paying them a wage that they can live on without working a second job." Cruz certainly has a point. On the specifics, teacher pay in Florida lags behind the national average by about $9,000. Teacher pay A spokesman for Cruz said she rounded up a figure from the U.S. News and World Report Best Jobs of 2017 rankings. The report showed the median salary for a U.S. high school teacher was $57,200 in 2015. Florida Department of Education data show the average salary for a teacher in Florida was $48,179 as of April 2016. That difference: about $9,021. We went in search of other rankings comparing public school teacher pay nationwide. The National Educational Association, a labor union, collects data from state education departments showing average classroom teacher pay in each state. The most recent numbers from fall 2016 show Florida teacher salary at $49,199 and the national average at $58,353 -- or a difference of about $9,154. (An analysis by the NEA earlier in the year showed a slightly different national average but the NEA allows states to provide updated data later in the year.) Florida has paid teachers less than the national average for many years pre-dating Scott’s tenure. A chart from the federal National Center for Education Statistics based on NEA data shows a similar pay gap between Florida and the national average in 2009-10 when Charlie Crist was governor. The most recent year that shows Florida teacher pay was anywhere close to the national average was in 1969-70. From previous fact-checks, we’ve learned comparing teacher pay nationwide is no simple task. Within a state, the pay and cost of living can vary among school districts depending on if they are small rural towns, urban centers or wealthy beachfront communities. Discrepancies in benefits, such as health insurance, can make a difference in take-home pay. Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters said that each school district negotiates salaries of their instructional and classroom staff locally. Additionally, Florida has no state income tax, she said (although income tax is only one piece of what people pay in taxes). Our ruling Cruz said, "Florida pays our teachers $10,000 a year less than the national average." The real difference between the average national and Florida pay for teachers is technically closer to $9,000 than $10,000. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-13599	"Roy Cooper's refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/aug/16/pat-mccrory/text/	Attorney General Roy Cooper, the Democratic challenger in the North Carolina governor’s race this fall, has been repeatedly accused by Republicans of politicizing the office by not defending laws unpopular with his Democratic base. The latest flap is over North Carolina’s voter ID law, which was overturned July 29 by a federal appeals court. Cooper represented the state through the trial and appellate court levels. But after the unanimous and strongly worded ruling against the state from the federal 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, Cooper said he wouldn’t pursue another appeal. "I think this is what we’re going to have," he said, according to The News & Observer. Gov. Pat McCrory, the Republican incumbent whose seat Cooper is trying to take this November, blasted him for that. McCrory later announced the state would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the ruling, even without Cooper. "If any North Carolina citizen decided not to do their job, they would no longer have a paycheck," McCrory said in a press release. "Roy Cooper should not be held to a different standard. Roy Cooper’s refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money, so his office must reimburse taxpayers immediately." Cooper makes $127,561 a year, and we’ll let others decide if he should work for free instead. We wanted to look into McCrory’s claim that "Roy Cooper’s refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money." That’s a two-part issue: Is he refusing to do his job? And by not having his office represent the state on further appeal, is he costing the state money? Concerns with Cooper Republican leaders said they didn’t trust Cooper, since he has said he didn’t personally agree with the voter ID law. So they hired outside lawyers to work alongside Cooper’s employees. Cooper’s team won the voter ID case at trial – hardly the outcome of someone trying to sabotage it – before losing on appeal. But McCrory spokesman Ricky Diaz said it was more than just Cooper’s comments that led to the hiring of the private attorneys – it was the fact that Cooper’s political campaign has received contributions from billionaire George Soros. Soros is a Democratic donor who has funded challenges to voting laws in several states, including North Carolina. Diaz said that’s a conflict of interest that should have led Cooper to step down from office. "There is precedent for attorneys general in North Carolina to resign while running for higher office when it conflicts with their duties," he said, citing former AG Robert Morgan, who resigned in 1974 to campaign full-time for the U.S. Senate. Cooper’s campaign disagrees. "Attorney General Cooper is doing his job by advising the state when they have passed clearly unconstitutional laws that will not be upheld by the courts," said campaign spokeswoman Megan Jacobs. The job of the attorney general We’ve already looked into an earlier claim, from N.C. Senate leader Phil Berger, that Cooper was not doing his job by refusing to defend the LGBT law known as House Bill 2, which is being challenged by individuals as well as the federal government. We rated Berger’s claim Half True. State law says the attorney general shall represent the state in court, and it doesn’t give any exceptions. But legal experts say the attorney general does have valid reasons not to represent the state sometimes. For instance, they argue, the AG takes an oath to uphold the constitution and thus shouldn’t defend a law he truly believes is unconstitutional. The voter ID situation isn’t totally similar to the HB2 situation, though. While Cooper argued from the outset that HB2 was unconstitutional, his office did defend the state’s voter ID law for years. So can an attorney general start representing his state in court but stop before the matter is finished? Legal experts are split. Michael Gerhardt, a UNC-Chapel Hill law professor, said he thinks Cooper’s actions on voter ID were acceptable. The question, he said, comes down to whether or not the AG is allowed to change his mind. "My take is that he can," Gerhardt said. But Campbell University law professor Gregory Wallace said he believes the AG’s discretion is more limited, and stopping representation partway through a case deserves strong scrutiny. "Refusing to defend should be rare and exceptional," he said. "When it happens in several cases over a short period of time which all involve highly politicized issues relevant to the AG's campaign for governor, voters reasonably may infer that the AG’s reasons are political, not constitutional." Cooper has done this before. He defended North Carolina’s 2012 constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, for two years, until the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a similar ban in Virginia. Cooper then said he would not continue North Carolina’s case, dubbing it a lost cause. The Supreme Court later proved him right, ruling in favor of gay marriage in 2015. Losing the state money? Whether or not Cooper’s actions are within the scope of his power, it’s a separate question whether he’s costing the state more money by not defending the law. That could be the case if the state suddenly had to hire private attorneys to take up its cause. But the state has been paying private attorneys from the start, even when Cooper was on the case. And it wasn’t just one set of attorneys. McCrory’s office hired one law firm, and the General Assembly hired a different law firm. In total, according to a recent report by WRAL-TV in Raleigh, the legislature has spent more than $4.8 million in state funds on its outside lawyers. And we don’t know how much extra McCrory has spent for the same case; WRAL said the governor’s office did not respond to its records request. Noelle Talley, a spokeswoman for the N.C. Department of Justice, said the private lawyers didn’t split up tasks with the state’s lawyers. "The work was duplicative," she said. So really, Cooper is saving the state money. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case, lawyers from his office will not be traveling on the taxpayer dime to Washington, D.C., and the private attorneys who will argue it were already on the public payroll. Talley couldn’t say exactly how much taxpayers might save, but the scenario she described includes savings in the hundreds of dollars – small savings, to be sure, but savings nonetheless. "Travel expenses would likely have included airfare, a hotel room for a couple of nights, and meals for one attorney," she said. Our ruling Gov. Pat McCrory said that in the voter ID lawsuit, Attorney General Roy Cooper’s "refusal to do his job is costing taxpayers money." There is a question whether Cooper has the power to decide not to appeal further. But the issue of money is more clear – his decision is actually saving the state money. Since McCrory hit on a valid topic of debate with his claim about Cooper’s job duties but missed the mark on his claim about money, we rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/02b4f996-19fa-4685-900a-375e4d00ef82	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-08-16T17:14:44	2016-08-02	['None']

pomt-12013	Under the Graham-Cassidy health insurance bill, in "states like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri, there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by by Obamacare."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/20/bill-cassidy/bill-cassidy-offers-misleading-defense-face-jimmy-/	Following a sharp rebuke by late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., hit the airwaves on Sept. 20 to defend his bill that would undo much of the Affordable Care Act. The bill, which Cassidy proposed with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was approaching Senate floor consideration when Kimmel took aim at the bill’s impact on some Americans’ ability to secure health insurance. Under the Graham-Cassidy bill, Cassidy said, "More people will have coverage, and we protect those with pre-existing conditions. (In) states like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri, there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by by Obamacare." We decided to take a closer look at the way Cassidy described the potential impact of his bill. We found that, according to the best available analysis, Cassidy is not fully accurate about the funding increase. How would Graham-Cassidy affect the states? The bill would establish a new "block grant" program for states, taking the place of funding currently provided under the Affordable Care Act. The current funding under the ACA is primarily in the form of subsidies for people who purchase plans on the ACA’s online marketplace, as well as an expansion of access to Medicaid. The bill’s approach holds the potential for state-level cuts in two ways. First, a block grant is a fixed amount of money, rather than a formula-based entitlement that continues paying even as the number of qualifying beneficiaries rises. So states might have to do more with less. Second, the bill does not authorize funding for the block grant beyond 2026. While Congress could choose to continue the funding at that point, there is no guarantee that it will. So that leaves a so-called fiscal "cliff" after which funding falls to zero, at least temporarily. In "states like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri, there will be billions more dollars" under Graham-Cassidy Because the bill would enshrine complex formulas to determine the size of each state’s block grant, individual states would see differently sized block grants. Generally speaking, the formula is more generous to states that chose not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (most of which are Republican-leaning). By contrast, the states that did expand Medicaid (many of them Democratic-leaning) would tend to do less well under Graham-Cassidy, based on various analyses. And if nothing is done to extend funding beyond 2026, all states would feel the pinch. We would ordinarily turn to the independent Congressional Budget Office to assess this part of Cassidy’s statement like this, but the CBO has said that, given the Republican leadership’s rush to get the Graham-Cassidy bill to the floor, it will be unable to do a full analysis of the bill before the planned vote. (Senate Republicans’ ability to pass the measure with just 51 votes expires at the end of September, which is widely considered the reason for the rush.) However, on Sept. 20, an outside consulting group, Avalere Health, released an analysis it had conducted of the bill’s potential impact on the 50 states. Overall, the report concluded that the Graham-Cassidy bill "would significantly reduce funding to states over the long term, particularly for states that have already expanded Medicaid," Caroline Pearson, Avalere’s senior vice president, wrote. It did find that in 16 states, funding would increase, at least as long as the block grants were funded. (The Washington Post’s Philip Bump noted that 15 of these 16 states with an increase voted for Donald Trump.) As it happens, the four states Cassidy mentioned don’t fare that well in Avalere’s analysis, even though all four decided against accepting the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, which should have been an indicator of a relatively benign funding outcome under the law. (In Florida's case, signups on the law's online marketplace have been widespread even as efforts to accept the Medicaid expansion have foundered.) The following chart summarizes Avalere’s projections for the states Cassidy mentioned, over three different time periods. The figures shaded red denote a decline. The figures shaded green denote an increase. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As the chart shows, Florida and Maine would both suffer declines in the billions of dollars during all three periods studied. Virginia and Missouri, for their part, would either gain or hold steady through 2027, but would then see roughly 20 percent declines through 2036. If these projections are to be believed -- and it’s worth emphasizing that they are only projections by one policy group -- then the four states Cassidy cited would not necessarily see "billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage" under the Graham-Cassidy bill over the long term. And Florida and Maine in particular would see only decreases. Obamacare "passed by" states like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri Some viewers will take this comment by Cassidy as simply explaining the reality that Obamacare isn't reaching enough people in these states. Others will note that this reality has more to do with Republican opposition in the states than with the law itself. The Affordable Care Act did in fact provide insurance marketplaces to residents of all 50 states through its federal website -- almost 2.5 million people in Cassidy’s four states alone. In addition, the Affordable Care Act as passed would have expanded Medicaid in every state. When the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the expansion, many states, most of them with a Republican governor or legislature, decided to opt out of the expansion. The four states Cassidy cited were among those to reject an expansion. So, if Cassidy is trying to say that Obamacare is at fault for having "passed by" these states, he has it backwards. The Affordable Care Act sought to expand Medicaid in every state. In those states where it didn’t occur, it was because the state affirmatively chose not to accept the offer. "Those states were not passed by" by the law itself, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Cassidy said that under his bill, in "states like Maine, Virginia, Florida, Missouri, there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by by Obamacare." Two of those four states will see a temporary bump in funding before settling in for a longer-term decline, according to the Avalere study. But the other two states won’t ever see a funding increase under the bill, according to Avalere. Cassidy also glosses over the fact that these states chose to ignore the law’s offerings on their own.

pomt-14869	The Trans-Pacific Partnership "was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/12/donald-trump/trump-says-china-will-take-advantage-trans-pacific/	Donald Trump likes to talk about how China takes advantage of the United States economy, so it wasn’t surprising to see him bring up the People’s Republic at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee. When asked a question about the recently released Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, Trump took to bashing China. "The TPP is horrible deal," Trump said. "It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone." "If you look at the way China and India and almost everybody takes advantage of the United States -- China in particular, because they're so good. It's the No. 1 abuser of this country," Trump said. "And if you look at the way they take advantage, it's through currency manipulation. It's not even discussed in the almost 6,000-page agreement." There’s just one problem with Trump’s rant on China, as Sen. Rand Paul emphatically pointed out at the debate: China isn’t actually a part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. To give Trump the benefit of the doubt, we asked some experts if there is any way China could benefit "through the back door" from the TPP. The short answer: no. An overview of the TPP While you could read the entire trade deal in full, as Trump correctly points out, it’s more than 6,000 pages long. Here’s a quick summary, and you can check out a more detailed guide on Vox: The TPP involves 12 countries: the United States, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei Darussalam. The deal is meant to reduce trade barriers between these countries by lowering tariffs on goods, coordinating regulations and more. The deal could also "provide stronger legal protections to drug companies, lengthen the term of copyright protection, give foreign investors a new way to challenge countries' laws and regulations, and much more," according to Vox. In June, Congress authorized "fast-track" authority for President Obama, meaning Congress will promptly approve or disapprove the agreement Obama has negotiated -- there will be no amendments or filibusters. A vote is expected in 2016. The deal was negotiated in secret before being released to the public. Again, we should make it clear: China was in no way involved in TPP negotiations. Can China somehow benefit? We asked experts if there was any way China could possibly take advantage of the TPP. The experts all agreed: The trade deal will most likely negatively impact China. Joel P. Trachtman, an international law professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, said the deal "would mean there would be zero tariffs on goods coming to the United States from places that compete with China." "It certainly wouldn’t be expected to help China," he said. The only way China might benefit, Trachtman said, is if it has investments in any of the countries involved in the deal. For example, if China has invested in plants in Vietnam, they might become more valuable to China; however, the benefits of those investments would be "small and rather insignificant." Daniel Pearson, a senior fellow in trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, said Trump’s assertion that China continuously manipulates its currency is completely off-base. "Some people are all wrapped up in this issue of currency manipulation. I don’t think that’s applicable to the Chinese," Pearson said. "It was never clear to me that China artificially lowered the value of its currency to gain an export advantage (in the past)." We should also note that the TPP actually does mention currency manipulation. A side agreement in the trade deal -- separate from the 6,000 page main text -- says the 12 countries involved agree not to artificially deflate the value of their currencies. However, there is no enforceability provision -- meaning the clause is more of an honor code than a strict regulation. "There aren't many economists who would be comfortable with an enforceable currency manipulation clause," says Emily J. Blanchard, an associate professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. "A binding currency provision would tie policy makers' hands at precisely the wrong time: when a central bank-- like the U.S. Federal Reserve-- needs to respond to a downturn in the local economy." The only way China could benefit from the TPP, Pearson said, is if it experiences the "spillover benefits" of increased trading between the 12 countries involved in the TPP. "There is some possibility that there will be trade diversion away from China and more trade between other TPP member countries," Pearson said. "That’s a potential negative. However, that may be entirely offset by the greater level of economic activity that we should expect to see in the TPP member countries." Blanchard said she finds it "highly implausible" that China would benefit from the TPP. If it does, as Pearson suggests, so would the rest of the countries involved in the agreement. "TPP is going to encourage greater trade integration among its signatories in Southeast Asia and beyond," she said. "That will inevitably suck some of the oxygen out of China’s local economy, as supply chains reorient toward other TPP countries, including the U.S." To Trump’s assertion that the trade deal was designed for China’s benefit, experts say it’s actually the opposite. While Blanchard said experts are reluctant to suggest the agreement is a way of taking a shot at China, the TPP does allow the United States to shape trade practices in the Pacific before China can. "If TPP passes, its enforceable labor and environmental provisions, curbs on state-owned enterprises, strong (intellectual property) laws, and transparency requirements will redefine the rules of the road in global trade agreements," she said. "This is definitely not the same rulebook that China would have written." All three experts agreed that China could try and join the TPP in the future, but it first has to meet the requirements laid out in the agreement -- something we shouldn’t expect to happen any time soon. China joining the TPP "would require further evolution of the Chinese economy to be more open and transparent," Pearson said. "It would definitely be good for the Chinese once they are able to join, but frankly, that would also be good for the United States." In the days after the debate, Trump was asked if he knew that China was not part of the trade deal. Trump said he did and repeated his claim that China could benefit. But he still didn’t explain how that would actually work. "Well, I know that China is not in the deal," Trump said. "And if they look at speeches they will see I talk about it all the time, this deal is going to be a great deal for China. It is going to be unbelievable because China is going to come in through the backdoor, and that is what I said. They are going to come in later through the backdoor and they will take advantage of what all of these other people were negotiating, and the Wall Street Journal does a big editorial that I didn't know about China." Our ruling Trump said the Trans Pacific Partnership "was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone." Not only is China not a part of the TPP, but the experts we talked to all agreed: The TPP isn’t exciting news for China. There’s a chance that China could join the TPP down the line, but not without robust changes to its economy. Until then, China doesn’t stand to gain much from having trade diverted to other countries. Trump can’t blame everything on China. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-11435	Says Beto O’Rourke wants "open borders and wants to take our guns."	false	/texas/statements/2018/mar/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-beto-orourke-wants-open-borders-and-/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas debuted a song the night of the Texas primaries setting Cruz on course to face Beto O’Rourke on the November 2018 ballot. It’s not a love song. The ditty portrays O’Rourke, a Democrat who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, as a liberal unelectable in Texas; voters there haven’t lifted a Democrat into statewide office since 1994. To the tune of Alabama’s "If You’re Gonna Play in Texas," the singer opens: "If you’re gonna run in Texas, you can’t be a liberal man." Cruz's song contains a trio of factual claims. For starters, the singer says O’Rourke started calling himself Beto rather than his given name of Robert to "fit in." O’Rourke responded to that sally with a tweet showing a photo of the candidate as a boy wearing a shirt inscribed, "Beto," tracing to his preschool days, O’Rourke told us by phone. SOURCE: Tweet, Beto O’Rourke, 1:26 p.m. March 7, 2018 The song's other claims touched off this fact-check: "Beto wants those open borders/And wants to take our guns." Without a doubt, we found, O’Rourke has objected to walling off the border and he favors a ban on civilian purchases of what critics call assault weapons including AR-15s, a type of semi-automatic rifle. However, he’s not called for opening the borders or for government agents to take guns from law-abiding residents. Open borders The concept of "open borders" drew the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter initially when Donald Trump in 2016 charged Democrat Hillary Clinton with favoring open borders. Experts said then that making it easier for undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status wasn’t the same as getting rid of enforcement and allowing open borders. But there’s a longer history to "open borders," which the U.S. essentially had for 85 years, the libertarian Cato Institute notes. "From 1790 to 1875," the institute says, any "immigrant from any country could legally enter, live and work in the United States." Yet Congress subsequently regulated immigration decade after decade while nowadays, Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh told us by email, there "are no members of Congress who support ‘open borders’ or anything that even approaches it." Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who authored a 2008 book on federal actions to tighten U.S. borders after 9/11, similarly told us he’s unaware of congressional advocates for opening our borders. "It’s a derogatory term," Alden said by phone, "that doesn’t have a whole lot of analytical meaning. It’s not even in the conversation in Washington," Alden said, where the focus since the 1990s has been on strengthening border security. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, asked the basis of Cruz’s "open borders" claim, pointed out that O’Rourke, an El Paso native and former member of the El Paso City Council, has been full-throated about opposing the border-long wall promised by President Trump as unlikely to improve security or the flow of trade. Also, she noted, O’Rourke has questioned the worth of existing border barriers. O’Rourke tweets and comments O’Rourke tweeted in January 2017: "Less than zero. That's the amount of immigration we have from MX. More Mexicans going south than coming to the U.S. Do we need a wall?" O’Rourke tweeted in April 2017: "We already have a border wall that we don't need. Don't need more walls and militarization at a time that the border has never been safer." An accompanying video shows O’Rourke standing in Hidalgo on the Texas-Mexico border and saying fencing there keeps Americans from fully enjoying a U.S. nature preserve. O’Rourke says: "You tell me if this looks like a war zone or we need to militarize it or if it needs a wall." O’Rourke told us by phone he doesn’t believe in open orders. Still, he said, "we don’t need walls. We already have over 600 miles of walls, fencing and physical barriers in place. We don’t need them. They’re not making us safer." Generally, O’Rourke said, "it should be easier for people to legally cross the border at ports of entry where they have inspections by a customs officer." He noted that in alignment with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, he successfully advocated in 2013-14 for an uptick in customs officers and improvements to ports of entry. Rob Friedlander of O’Rourke’s House office answered our request for detail with emails pointing out matching port of entry infrastructure proposals filed in 2013 by Cornyn and O’Rourke and an omnibus measure signed into law in 2014 including language authorizing the government to enter into cost-sharing agreements at ports of entry and to accept donations toward building, maintaining or altering related infrastructure; the measure also authorized the addition of 2,000 customs agents at a cost of $256 million. O’Rourke’s campaign website We also checked O’Rourke’s campaign website for mentions of open borders. On a web page devoted to immigration, O’Rourke says "the surest way to improve safety and security is not to build a wall or spend billions more, but to ensure that we are maximizing the potential from everyone in this state, treating each other with respect and dignity." O’Rourke goes on to list six steps he favors including a "Dreamer" law giving residents who entered the U.S. as children paths to permanent legal residency and citizenship. The site includes no call for an open border. City of El Paso resolution From earlier years, Cruz’s camp pointed out a City of El Paso document showing that O’Rourke backed a council resolution objecting to previous federal plans to expand fencing near the border. That 799-word resolution, adopted unanimously in January 2009, says local fencing mandated by the Secure Border Fence Act of 2006 "will only divide the El Paso/Juarez community and do nothing to advance a comprehensive approach to immigration reform." The resolution also says "the complex issues of illegal immigration and a porous border cannot be fixed by an enforcement-only approach. Any solutions must take a multi-layered approach to multi-layered issues created over decades of neglect." Also, the resolution "encourages the federal government to re-examine the construction of the fence along the entire southern border." The resolution doesn’t include a pitch for opening the border entirely. O’Rourke in Congress So, has O’Rourke championed open borders in Congress? Alden noted by email that O’Rourke, who joined the House in 2013, voted that year with colleagues on the House Homeland Security Committee to approve a measure offered by the panel chairman, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, that included a goal for federal officers to apprehend 90 percent of people crossing the border illegally. We confirmed O’Rourke’s "aye" vote from the committee’s May 2013 report to Congress on its approval of the Border Security Results Act of 2013. Also spotted: A post-vote statement in the report, inserted on behalf of committee Democrats, objecting to officials trying to stop all illicit border activity. The statement from Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Miss. says committee Democrats didn’t share the Republican majority’s view that "striving to stop 100 percent of all illicit cross-border activity should be the attitude of every (Homeland Security) Department employee with a border security mission." Thompson’s statement suggests such a focus could weaken security elsewhere: "Specifically, we are concerned that asking DHS to interdict 100 percent of illicit cross-border activity between the ports of entry would unduly divert limited resources from other border security efforts, potentially undermining our nation's homeland security or economic security. Instead, Democratic members strongly support a comprehensive, risk-based approach to border security that would maximize our enforcement efforts both at and between the ports of entry, while facilitating the legitimate flow of cross-border trade and travel." Taking guns As far as O’Rourke wanting to "take our guns," Cruz’s camp pointed out that O’Rourke was among sponsors of an unsuccessful 2015 House proposal, opposed by the NRA, to bar the import, manufacture and sale of "assault weapons." More recently, we found, O’Rourke ranks among cosponsors of the 2018 version of the legislation authored by Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I. The 2018 measure would bar the import, manufacture, sale or possession of any semi-automatic weapon--some 205 firearms, Frazier told us by email--or "large capacity ammunition feeding device." But the proposal also says the bar wouldn’t apply to any semi-automatic assault weapon or feeding device lawfully held before the act passes into law. O’Rourke told us by phone: "My intent is for AR-15s not to be sold to the public." A word: The AR-15 is a derivative of a semi-automatic rifle first developed by gunmaker ArmaLite in the 1950s. The AR refers to ArmaLite rifle, and does not stand for "assault rifle." As of 2016, there were between 6 million and 10 million of these semi-automatic rifles in U.S. circulation. The NRA refers to this style of weapon as a "modern sporting rifle." To our inquiry, Richard Luchette, a Cicilline aide, noted by email that the O’Rourke-backed proposal exempts from the ban 2,258 "legitimate hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns that are named by make and model and specifically exempted from the ban. There are a couple other exemptions too – antique weapons, weapons used by the military and law enforcement, weapons owned at the time of the bill’s enactment, and any firearm that is operated by a bolt, pump, lever, or slide action," Luchette wrote. We noticed otherwise that the measure authorizes federal funds to be spent on government "buy-back" programs for semiautomatic assault weapons and ammunition feeding devices. But we saw no language authorizing or directing officials to take existing guns. Frazier, following up, said by email that removing from availability the weapons named in the legislation adds up to taking guns. "The people of Texas deserve an explanation from him as to how his support for criminalizing the future sale, transfer and possession of such firearms, does not amount to coming after their guns," Frazier wrote. Other analysts For an outside analysis, we turned to Jaclyn Schildkraut, an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Oswego who has studied mass shootings. Schildkraut told us by email that despite the ban legislation lacking language calling for guns to be taken, "gun rights advocates state that removing any one type of gun is effectively removing all guns." Whatever the proposal explicitly says, Schildkraut said, it’d be impractical for the government to collect banned guns in part because there’s no federal registry showing who owns such firearms. "Short of committing a crime or turning one in on your own, there’s no way they’d know you have it," Schildkraut said. We also heard back from Joseph Olson, a Mitchell Hamline School of Law professor emeritus and former member of the NRA’s board of directors. By email, Olson agreed the O’Rourke-cosponsored measure doesn’t call for taking guns up front. But, Olson said by email, there’s suspicion among gun-rights’ advocates that once such a proposal starts making its way into law, it’ll be amended by Congress to enable or even require the government to collect guns. Our ruling Cruz says in his song that O’Rourke wants "open borders and wants to take our guns." O’Rourke opposes President Trump’s avowed U.S.-Mexico border wall and also maintains that existing fencing he opposed in the first place doesn’t make us safer. But we didn’t spot evidence that O’Rourke wants U.S. borders open without restriction. O’Rourke backs a ban on the future sale and possession of about 200 kinds of guns including AR-15-style rifles. But the legislation he’s cosponsoring doesn’t provide for officials to take any guns held lawfully at the time the measure becomes law. We rate this Cruz claim False.

Today, it rises by that amount in about an hour www.attackthedebt.com • "Scary" fact #2 Post WW2 national debt was 122% of GDP, by 1970 it was down to 38%, now it's 95% of GDP www.attackthedebt.com • Debt more than doubled since '00, increased 41% in just 3 years under Pres Obama. Both parties to blame. www.attackthedebt.com "Scary" facts, huh? Labels such as that practically beg for closer scrutiny. We decided to investigate the first claim, which required a little arithmetic. Does the debt really grow at $75 million an hour today? We also took a quick look at claims No. 2 and 3, just to be thorough. They were easy to verify through federal websites. For "Scary Fact #2," we looked at the Office of Management and Budget tables showing the debt as a percent of GDP. In 1946, the total federal debt was 121.7 percent of GDP. In 1970, it was 37.6 percent, and now (for 2010), it's 93.2 percent. Those are close enough to Hasner's numbers. For his third claim, we checked the same link. From the end of fiscal year 2000 (Sept. 30, 2000) through fiscal year 2010 (Sept. 30, 2010), the total debt rose 140 percent, more than doubled, so Hasner's right on that part. We switched to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's website to check the change since Barack Obama became president because that site lists a daily amount for the debt. From inauguration day on Jan. 20, 2009, when the debt was $10.627 trillion, to May 12, when it was $14.308 trillion, the increase is about 35 percent. Not quite the 41 percent Hasner cites, but also close. So let's go back to our fact-check on his first tweet. Debt history The first part of this tweet is easy to check out. The Treasury Department website goes back to Jan. 1, 1791 -- the earliest date available -- when the historical debt outstanding was $75,463,476.52. So, Hasner was right about that too. But how did he determine the rate at which the debt increases today? We asked Rick Wilson, his Republican campaign consultant, to explain the math. It turns out Hasner, um, borrowed all three claims from CBS MoneyWatch.com story posted in November 2010, called "18 Scary US Debt Facts." The claim we're checking from Hasner is the first to appear in Jill Schlesinger's story. She provides a link to the website of Ed Hall, who runs an online Debt Clock and appears to be the original source of this factoid (his debt clock was not working as of May 19, 2011, and the FAQ link was also inaccessible at times). Hall, a software engineer from California, said he started the website in 1995 as a lesson in Web programming. He couches his statement a little bit more than either the MoneyWatch story or Hasner by adding "or so" at the end. In an e-mail, Hall wrote: "That number is out of date (it was correct at the time I wrote it) but now the National Debt rises by about $165 million per hour. I get this by dividing the average daily debt increase over the past few years ($4.02 billion) by 24." Our math Hasner tweeted his claim on May 10, 2011. That's important because he says the debt rises by $75 million in about an hour "today." We looked at the rate at which the debt increased from April 10 to May 10, 2011. To do that, we used very precise numbers provided by the Treasury's "Debt to the Penny and Who Holds it" feature, which allows you to look up the daily total U.S. public debt for any date since March 31, 2005. We'll provide the long numbers so you can follow along. For April 10, 2011, that number was $14,265,383,134,019.53 For May 10, 2011, it was $14,331,522,797,881.61 The difference between those figures, which tells us how much the debt grew over 30 days, is $66,139,663,862.08. Divide that by 30 and you learn the debt increased by $2,204,655,462 a day. That sum divided by 24 is $91,860,644.25, which exceeds Hasner's figure of about $75 million an hour. For more context, we applied the same method to Oct. 18, 2010, and Nov. 18, 2010 (the day the CBS MoneyWatch story was published). Oct. 18: $13,668,894,473,093.42 Nov. 18: $13,788,455,142,118.05 Using the same method, but dividing by 31 days instead of 30, we found the hourly debt increase to be $160,669,824. That's closer to the amount gleaned with Hall's method. As you see, the rate the debt grows can vary month to month and year to year. It depends on how big the budget deficit is at any point in time. (The debt, as explained here, is the sum of all past deficits.) Our ruling Hasner relied on a months-old news story, without attributing it, for his string of "scary" debt tweets. That posed a problem for part of his first claim, that the hourly increase of the debt is $75 million. His message -- that the debt is huge and growing rapidly -- is accurate, but he would have achieved a more up-to-date total had he done his own math. He is off by millions of dollars. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Adam Hasner	None	None	None	2011-05-20T17:55:28	2011-05-10	['None']
pomt-13811	"John Faso took money from fossil fuel companies as they tried to take your land by eminent domain for a fracked gas pipeline."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2016/jul/18/zephyr-teachout/adding-context-zephyr-teachouts-claim-john-fasos-w/	Zephyr Teachout came out swinging against Republican John Faso after winning the 19th Congressional District’s Democratic primary. During a speech to supporters in Kingston on primary night, Teachout focused on Faso’s role in a controversial natural gas pipeline project. "I stood with you against fossil fuel lobbyists, and together we protected our water and our land against fracking," Teachout said. "And John Faso took money from fossil fuel companies as they tried to take your land by eminent domain for a fracked gas pipeline." High-volume hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, emerged as a huge issue in upstate New York, particularly in the Southern Tier where the 19th Congressional District stretches. Was Teachout right about Faso taking money from fossil fuel companies that planned to use eminent domain? Faso’s background John Faso left his post as Assembly minority leader to run for state comptroller in 2002. He lost that election. He unsuccessfully ran for governor as the Republican nominee in 2006. After his failed comptroller bid, Faso worked for the Albany lobbying and consultant firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. In 2014 he left to start his own firm. He worked as a public affairs consultant for the Constitution Pipeline project until 2015. That project was called off earlier this year. The pipeline would have run through parts of the congressional district Faso now seeks to represent. The Constitution Pipeline Co. paid Faso for his work on behalf of the Constitution Pipeline project. The project The proposed pipeline would have transported natural gas from Pennsylvania - which allows fracking - through New York State - which has banned fracking. The pipeline would have transported gas extracted from fracking. So that part of Teachout’s statement checks out. The company that proposed the project pointed to the estimated economic benefits for local communities. Aside from the tax revenue, municipalities would have had the option to tap into the pipeline to supply natural gas to local residents. Environmental advocates argued against the pipeline by warning about its potential impact on the state’s infrastructure and environment. They were also concerned for the safety of residents who would have lived near the pipeline. The pipeline had to be approved by the state and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Homeowners would have received compensation if the pipeline crossed their land. If they had not come to an agreement with the company, the resident’s land could have possibly been used anyway through eminent domain with compensation set by a court. The title of the property would still belong to the owner. The state has blocked the pipeline, but the company has appealed the decision. Faso’s role Faso’s campaign says he worked with the company as a public outreach consultant for three years from 2012 to 2015. In that role, he was a liaison to communities that would have been affected by the Constitution Pipeline project. Part of his role was to speak at public meetings about the project. Faso did not lobby lawmakers and regulators on behalf of the project. He only handled relations between the company and the public. No one would have lost land had the project gone forward. The company would have paid residents to use their land, but the title would have remained in their name. A call to the Constitution Pipeline company was not returned. Our ruling Zephyr Teachout claimed that John Faso "took" money from fossil fuel companies while they were trying to use eminent domain to build a pipeline on the properties of residents in the 19th Congressional District. He was paid for his work with the company, but landowners would still hold the title to their property if the company used it for the pipeline.

pomt-05393	Says "I never billed a single hour of my time to the City of Portland in the last 10 years -- so, no revolving door."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2012/may/05/charlie-hales/it-true-charlie-hales-private-sector-never-billed-/	Charlie Hales was a Portland city commissioner in 2002 when he accepted a job offer from HDR to pitch streetcars around the country. He left in June of that year, without completing his term in office. His critics have complained about this for two reasons. One, Hales quit while in office. And two, he took a job with a company that conducted business with the city. It rarely looks good for an elected official to jump to a private company that makes money off that city’s taxpayers. One of Hales’ chief opponents, Eileen Brady, said she would propose an ordinance calling for a time-out period between elected officials leaving office and taking a job with a company that does business with the city. Hales raised the word "insinuendo" in response. Here’s what he said: "I took a position with a company where I then immediately proceeded to work all over the country in cities everywhere but Portland. I never billed a single hour of my time to the City of Portland in the last 10 years, so, no revolving door. I held myself to that standard for just the very reason and just the very concern that was just mentioned a minute ago. So I held myself to that highest ethical standard and never ever had a conflict of interest with my former employer, the city of Portland." We know that’s a long chunk to read. But the response is important in its entirety. Because we understand his response to mean that in the last decade Hales never conducted business with the city on behalf of his employer. So we were surprised to learn that Hales and HDR bid on a contract in 2007, when the Portland Office of Transportation issued a bid for the Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan. HDR did not get the contract. Hales’ office confirmed he was involved in trying to land the contract. They said he has helped submit bids on hundreds of projects across the country, and just this one in Portland in the time he's been away from City Hall. "There is nothing unethical about responding to a request for proposals. No money changed hands, and the proposal was not accepted," Hales said through his campaign manager, Jessica Moskovitz. Hales violated no ethics laws or rules by bidding on a city contract five years after leaving office. But his full-bodied explanation at the debate led us to believe he kept his distance from the city in order to hold himself to "that highest ethical standard." There was no revolving door, because he didn’t get in. It’s true Hales has never billed the city for his work with HDR -- but it wasn’t for lack of trying. The statement contains an element of truth -- he never billed the city -- but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression about Hales’ business relationship with the city.

pomt-05110	"There is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/28/michael-doherty/michael-doherty-says-red-light-cameras-new-jersey-/	Big Brother, New Jersey Sen. Michael Doherty has his eye on you. And the Warren County Republican isn’t the only one watching those eyes in the sky known as red-light cameras. Enough people have questioned the reliability of the cameras that the state Department of Transportation on June 19 suspended a five-year pilot program for the devices because of concerns about yellow light timing with most of the cameras in the state. But Doherty has questioned the cameras’ reliability for some time, citing concerns about privacy, revenue and actual impact on reducing collisions. "There is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used," Doherty said in a May 14 news release about a bill he introduced to ban the cameras in New Jersey. So far the evidence seems stacked in Doherty’s corner, PolitiFact New Jersey found First, some data about the cameras: they work with a traffic control device to photograph or record vehicles that disregard a red signal. Police review the images to verify if a violation happened. Summonses are mailed to drivers. Communities and the companies that installed the cameras share the revenue. In New Jersey’s case, we reviewed a November 2011 report presented to the Legislature about the first year of the cameras’ effectiveness, through June 1, 2011. A second-year report has not yet been sent to the Legislature, according to DOT spokesman Joe Dee. At the time of its report, the DOT noted that just two intersections (of 59 studied) – both in Newark -- had been recording violations for a full year: Broad and Market streets, and Broad Street at Raymond Boulevard. Crash and accident cost data for both locations prior to the cameras’ installation and after showed decreases of near 50 percent for three types of crashes and damages cost decreases of $149,000. But the DOT questioned that data. "Although these calculations suggest a potential positive effect on safety as a result of the pilot program, we believe the data are too limited to draw any meaningful conclusions at this time," the report states. "The Department therefore recommends continued data collection and monitoring of RLR (Red Light Running) program intersections." We also reviewed studies and data from organizations such as the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Safer Streets L.A., the National Motorists Association and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that address concerns that more accidents result at camera-controlled intersections, in part because the yellow signal isn’t long enough. "Providing adequate yellow time and a brief phase when all signals are red is important and can reduce crashes, but those things alone don't eliminate the need for or potential benefits of red light cameras," the Institute says on its website. "Studies have shown that increasing yellow timing to values associated with guidelines published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers ‘can significantly decrease the frequency of red light violations.’" "One of our main objections to the use of red light cameras is that often they provide a perverse incentive for jurisdictions to refrain from implementing effective safety countermeasures such as an increase in the yellow phase timing because it would result in a decrease in violations and consequently a decrease in revenue," Jay Beeber, executive director of Safer Streets L.A., said in an e-mail. Steve Carrellas, spokesman for the New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association, said a properly engineered intersection is a better deterrent for crashes than red-light cameras. Our ruling Doherty claimed, "There is little if any evidence that the use of red light cameras in New Jersey has reduced the number or severity of accidents at the intersections where they are used." A state DOT report showed some decreases in certain types of crashes and the costs of damages, but emphasized that the data collected through June 1, 2011 is too small to make definitive decisions about the cameras’ effectiveness.

pomt-13492	"Classified material has a header which says ‘top-secret, secret, confidential.’ Nothing, and I will repeat this and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-none-her-emails-were-labeled-top-secr/	During an NBC forum that focused on the presidential candidates’ national security chops, host Matt Lauer asked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton why it isn’t disqualifying that she dealt with highly sensitive material on a private, unclassified email system. Clinton said she made a mistake using the system, but she still took classification seriously. "I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state," she said. "Classified material has a header which says ‘top secret, secret, confidential.’ Nothing, and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header." Given that we’ve found Clinton’s email did contain some classified information, this statement intrigued us. Information isn’t classified until a designated authority within the government declares it classified. The way that person shows their determination is by adding a header and footer to the relevant document, often tacking on a cover sheet, too — all to make it clear that the document contains classified information. Clinton is correct that the FBI did not find any such labels in her emails. Of the tens of thousands of emails the FBI reviewed, 81 email chains found on Clinton’s private servers included classified information, as determined by various U.S. intelligence agencies, according to a FBI report released Sept. 2. Just three email chains included some sort of classification marking: At least one paragraph preceded by the marking "(C)," indicating that those paragraphs were "confidential," the lowest level of classification. But none of the three had a header, footer or cover page further signaling that the emails contained confidential information. Even though there was a "(C)" preceding the paragraphs, this information was not properly marked confidential because it did not include the header, FBI Director James Comey said in a July 7 hearing before Congress. It’s "reasonable," he said, that Clinton may not have realized these were classified. For Clinton’s part, she told the FBI that "she did not know what the "(C)" meant at the beginning of the paragraphs and speculated it was referencing paragraphs marked in alphabetical order," according to the bureau’s report. She also disputed the need for these particular paragraphs to be classified at all. So that’s three email chains out of 81 found to include classified information on Clinton’s private email server. What about the other 78? Clinton, in her statement, said classified material has a header that says "classified" and that none her emails had that header. But that leaves out the possibility of what happened in this case — classified information is left unlabeled as a result of human error. All information determined to be classified should have a header in order to designate it properly. But if someone makes a mistake and forgets to include the label after that original determination, the information is still classified. "In that case, the information was classified, but in the absence of markings, the person receiving the information may have no realistic way of knowing that fact," said Liza Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice. " ‘Classified’ isn’t an inherent or self-evident status. It’s an act," she said. "And that act is rather meaningless if not conveyed to others." Comey has said it’s understandable that Clinton did not realize some of this unmarked information was classified. But he also has said she should have recognized by the topic of discussion that some of these emails did not belong on a non-classified system, given that 36 of these email chains had "secret" information and eight had "top secret" information. "There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation," Comey said in a July 5 statement. For example, some of these email discussions touched on the CIA’s drone program. Members of Clinton’s staff told the FBI that some of this supposedly classified drone-related information had already been revealed to the public in news reports. Clinton regularly dealt with classified information as secretary of state. She has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office, and she used other secure channels when traveling. Some emails now made public actually show Clinton’s team discussing how they couldn’t email each other classified information over the private server and instead had to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue. In the end, Comey said the Justice Department shouldn’t prosecute Clinton because there isn’t enough evidence that she intentionally mishandled classified information, nor did investigators find vast quantities of exposed classified material. Many transparency experts say the government regularly over-classifies, such as classifying information that wouldn’t actually damage national security if released. That’s likely the case regarding Clinton’s emails, said Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, which favors less classification. "The point is there's no objective standard for classification," Blanton said. "Very little of what's classified would be deemed so by all experienced observers." Our ruling Clinton said, "Classified material has a header which says ‘top secret, secret, confidential.’ Nothing, and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the reports by the Department of Justice, none of the emails sent or received by me had such a header." For information to be considered properly marked classified, it must contain a header. Clinton is correct that nothing in her email had a header signifying its classification status. Three email chains had a "(C)" indicating "confidential" information, but that is not enough to consider the emails properly marked classified. But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t any classified information in her email. If someone has determined information to be classified, it is still technically classified even if someone neglects to label it down the line. The FBI found 81 email chains that contained information determined to be classified, though none of the information was appropriately labeled, so it wasn’t necessarily obvious to the recipients. Clinton’s carefully worded statement is accurate but needs additional information. For that, we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-11744	"In the current law, if you report harassment, you're the one that has to go into 20 hours of counseling before you can decide whether you were really harassed."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/08/roy-blunt/blunt-partially-accurate-senate-sexual-harassment-/	The U.S. Senate needs to clean up its own house when it comes to sexual harassment charges, regardless of whether Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore wins his Dec. 12 election, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt has argued. Some Senate Republicans, including Blunt have not endorsed Moore, who is accused of sexual misconduct with a 14-year-old girl and several other teenagers, saying it’s up to Alabama voters whether to choose him or Democrat Doug Jones. Others, including President Donald Trump, are backing Moore. The election comes amid fallout of sexual misconduct claims against Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., who announced his resignation on Dec. 7, and Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., who stepped down on Dec. 5. Blunt said he and a few colleagues are trying to address sexual harassment procedures for charges against members of Congress because "we need to be sure that we’ve got an environment where people want to come and be a part of that." "In the current law, if you report harassment, you’re the one that has to go into 20 hours of counseling before you can decide whether you were really harassed or not," Blunt said on Meet the Press on Nov. 19, 2017. "That’s just totally inappropriate." That seemed like an uncommon rule, so we wanted to dig into Blunt’s claim. Reporting harassment in Congress The standards for investigating employees and members of Congress is a lot different from ones laid out for the public in other states, and the process has come under scrutiny as allegations in Hollywood, politics and journalism have piled up. Congress’ rules for handling sexual harassment allegations are under the spotlight after reporting by The Washington Post and others found lawmakers essentially write their own rules for handling claims. Some lawmakers are working to fix their own workplace culture. The Post reported the story of a 19-year-old intern who said she was the victim of sexual misconduct but did not report it for fear of losing her job. The Post also shed light on another unique rule for reporting sexual harassment on Capitol Hill: The confidential payouts in settlements come from a special U.S. Treasury fund supported by tax dollars. Any member or employee of Congress who reports a violation of the Congressional Accountability Act (including sexual harassment) must go through mandatory steps to file a claim. This is known as the Dispute Resolution Process. Blunt’s statement addresses the first step: counseling. The person reporting sexual harassment must request counseling with the Office of Compliance within 180 days of the alleged harassment. According to the posted procedures, the counseling period normally lasts 30 days. But it may be reduced at the request of the employee. In Blunt’s statement, he said the counseling process takes 20 hours. We were unable to confirm the number of counseling hours each person receives during the 30-day period. When we asked Blunt’s office, spokesperson Katie Boyd pointed us to the Office of Compliance. Laura Cech, the outreach and publications coordinator for the Office of Compliance, did not specify whether Blunt was correct in saying 20 hours. She responded with a Q&A the office developed Nov. 13 outlining what they see as "the most common misconceptions" from the media about the process. The first question is about the required "counseling" — but it does not include how the 30-day process translates into hours. A counselor will "discuss with an employee the information that gave rise to their concerns, and inform them of their rights under the law," the document says. It also notes the counseling can be completed over the phone or through a designated representative, such as an attorney. Remaining steps continue after counseling if the employee still believes he or she has been sexually harassed. The steps include a 30-day mediation where both parties are allowed the opportunity to resolve the dispute, administrative hearing or civil action, and the appeals process where the employee can request the final decision be reviewed by the OOC Board of Directors. Sandy Davidson, a professor at the University of Missouri who teaches law in the journalism school, said, "The rules are bizarre and totally unfriendly to women." Davidson also noted the confidentiality aspect of the laws. The rules say all statements, communications and documents during the mediation process are confidential. In Missouri, you can file a complaint with the Missouri Commission on Human Rights, which investigates complaints in public accommodations about race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, disability, age and familial status. There is no requirement for counseling. Once the complaint is filed, the commission investigates by interviewing both sides. If the investigator finds discrimination, the commission attempts to settle the case. If the case is not settled, a hearing process gives a final decision and determines whether remedies such as back pay, reinstatement or promotion are ordered. Our ruling Blunt said, "In the current law, if you report harassment, you’re the one that has to go into 20 hours of counseling before you can decide whether you were really harassed." According to the Office of Compliance, any employee or member of Congress must go through counseling for a 30-day period before they can continue with further steps of reporting the harassment.

pomt-10306	"Big oil's filling John McCain's campaign with $2-million in contributions."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/06/barack-obama/make-that-at-least-2-million/	Sen. Barack Obama's campaign has a new television advertisement called "Pocket," as in Sen. John McCain's in one, and it belongs to Big Oil. "Every time you fill your tank, the oil companies fill their pockets," the announcer says. "Now big oil's filling John McCain's campaign with $2-million in contributions. Because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers, McCain wants to give them another $4-billion in tax breaks. After one president in the pocket of big oil, we can't afford another." We're focusing specifically on the claim that oil companies gave McCain $2-million, because it's the foundation for the claims that follow. A new ad by the Democratic National Committee makes a similar claim, alleging: "[The] oil industry contributes $2-million to McCain campaign." First, we should note that corporations, oil and otherwise, are prohibited by law from contributing to political campaigns. There are ways around that, including having executives and employees donate in their own names. But saying "big oil's filling John McCain's campaign" is a somewhat misleading shorthand. But it would be telling if oil executives and employees gave a couple million to McCain. So let's see about that number. Individuals involved in the oil and gas industries have given about $1.3-million to McCain's presidential campaign, according to the latest federal data compiled and released here by the Center for Responsive Politics on July 28. That includes not just multinational and independent oil and gas producers and refiners, but also natural gas pipeline companies, gasoline service stations and fuel oil dealers. Perhaps it's a bit unfair to lump all of them into the category "big oil." But more importantly, that's not $2-million. It's also not the whole story, though. McCain's campaign also set up a joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee and several state affiliates. Our friends at FactCheck.org have decided contributions to that committee shouldn't count as contributions to "McCain's campaign," as the ad puts it. We disagree. The joint fundraising committee is called McCain Victory 2008 . The McCain campaign receives the first $2,300 of each contribution to the joint committee. The RNC gets most of the rest, but it can be hard to distinguish a presidential campaign from the national party anyway. Nonpartisan campaign finance experts at both the Center for Responsive Politics and Campaign Money Watch told us it was reasonable to count contributions to McCain Victory 2008 as contributions to McCain's campaign. "What else would a donor expect when they're giving to the McCain Victory 2008 fund?" said David Donnelly, director of Campaign Money Watch. So the question is, do contributions from oil and gas executives or employees to McCain Victory 2008, when added to the $1.3-million that went directly to McCain's campaign, top $2-million? The answer is yes, easily. McCain Victory 2008 has reported 7,825 contributions to the Federal Election Commission. We didn't go through all of them, but we did, with Donnelly's help, look at 40 of the largest contributions from individuals whose employers or occupations are obviously oil-related. We picked only the low-hanging fruit. For example, we counted a $50,000 contribution that Gary Chouest, president of the oil vessel service company Edison Chouest Offshore, made on June 17, 2008, but not a contribution for the same amount that Carolyn Chouest, a homemaker and presumably Gary's wife, made the same day. The total for just those 40 large contributions was $1.04-million. Up to $2,300 from each contribution might already have been counted in the $1.3-million total, since the campaign itself has to report contributions that come to it through the joint committee. So to avoid double-counting, we subtracted $92,000 ($2,300 x 40) from the total, and got $948,000. Combined with the $1.3-million that went to the campaign, that's easily enough to push McCain over $2-million in oil contributions. It's worth pointing out that Obama, too, has accepted at least hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil industry executives and employees, as we note here , and the Center for Responsive Politics points out more recently here . But we're focusing on the claim that big oil gave McCain's campaign $2-million. It's not unequivocally true, because the phrasing implies that the big oil corporations themselves were the givers, when it was actually their executives and employees, not to mention those of smaller natural gas companies. But energy industry players clearly have given McCain well over $2-million, so we find the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-06T00:00:00	2008-08-04	['None']
pomt-13344	"In the state of Indiana, I’ve signed more than $3.5 billion in tax relief."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/04/mike-pence/mike-pence-leaves-out-some-details-his-tax-cut/	As Donald Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence is getting scrutiny for his record as governor of Indiana. Pence, who is finishing out his first term and is not seeking another, has touted his record on taxes -- a key issue for Republican voters. Speaking near Richmond, Va., on his way to the vice presidential debate in nearby Farmville, Pence said, "In the state of Indiana, I’ve signed more than $3.5 billion in tax relief." Is that correct? We found that Pence has backing for the number, but he glosses over some important details. When we checked with Pence’s staff, they pointed to figures released by the Indiana Office of Management and Budget detailing some of the changes enacted by Pence and state legislators early in his term. The changes included a reduction in the personal income tax rate from 3.4 percent to 3.23 percent, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from 7.5 percent to 4.9 percent, and a full repeal of the estate tax. (Pence had initially sought a 10 percent reduction in the individual income tax rate, but Republicans in the legislature wanted more corporate tax relief, so the final bill cut income taxes by half of the rate Pence had wanted.) Here is the data Pence’s staff provided to PolitiFact. (Totals may vary slightly due to rounding.) Year Individual income tax Corporate income tax Inheritance tax Financial Institutions Tax Total Fiscal 2014 0 0 $61 million $1.7 million $63 million Fiscal 2015 $65 million 0 $131 million $8.2 million $204 million Fiscal 2016 $159 million $12 million $113 million $12.9 million $297 million Fiscal 2017 $214 million $41 million $96 million $19.2 million $370 million Fiscal 2018 $292 million $70 million $78 million $23.9 million $464 million Fiscal 2019 $307 million $100 million $61 million $25.7 million $493 million Fiscal 2020 $318 million $130 million $44 million $28.9 million $520 million Fiscal 2021 $329 million $148 million $26 million $33.9 million $537 million Fiscal 2022 $341 million $190 million $9 million $40.5 million $580 million Total $2.024 billion $691 million $620 million $195 million $3.5 billion Source: Indiana Office of Management and Budget So Pence can point to specific data showing that the tax cuts he signed into law amount to $3.5 billion. However, it’s worth pointing out some important caveats: • This total covers nine fiscal years, including several well into the future. Budget windows of this length aren’t unusual in the world of policy wonkery, and Pence avoided a stumbling block by wording his statement carefully to say that he "signed" that much tax relief into law -- not that $3.5 billion in tax relief has materialized yet. Still, nine years is a pretty long period of time, and it would not be obvious to the casual observer that the figure in question covers a span that long. Indeed, 2022 will be six years after Pence left the governor’s mansion, and even if he had run for a second term and won, 2022 would have been two years after he left office. • The benefits are "backloaded." That’s budget-speak for pushing the cost off into the future -- meaning that some other governor or lawmaker will have to grapple with the fiscal impact. Specifically, three years into the tax cuts, only 16 percent of the final amount has been realized so far. The remaining 84 percent is still to come between 2017 and 2022. And looking just at the individual income tax cuts, only 11 percent have been realized so far, with 89 percent still to come. With so much of the total amount still pending, a lot of the tax relief Pence touts will come to fruition only with the consent of future governors and legislatures. A national recession or a prolonged slump within Indiana might make it impossible for elected officials to stick to this timetable for cuts. • The numbers come from one of the governor’s own offices. The head of the state Office of Management and Budget is appointed by the governor, all the staffers are effectively gubernatorial staffers, and the physical office of the director is right next to that of the governor's chief of staff. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the numbers are wrong or biased, but it’s worth noting that they are not calculated by a fully independent governmental entity or a group that is outside of state government entirely. Our ruling Pence said, "In the state of Indiana, I’ve signed more than $3.5 billion in tax relief." Figures from an office Pence controls did produce projections of tax cuts at that level. But it’s worth noting that a relatively small share of those cuts have happened already -- 84 percent are set to occur in fiscal years 2017 through 2022, a period far enough in the future to make it an open question whether the cuts will ultimately materialize.

pomt-02934	Most voters prefer zombies to the current U.S. Congress.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/31/ed-lindsey/whos-scarier-zombies-or-congress/	Readers, beware. You might encounter something spooky this Halloween. A zombie? Nah, more frightening than that. Yep, a member of Congress. Boo! It’s John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi at your door. "[A] majority of voters actually prefer the blood-hungry creatures of The Walking Dead and Zombieland to the current Congress," state Rep. Ed Lindsey, R-Atlanta, wrote in a press release. "One poll earlier this month found that a plurality of registered voters prefer real zombies over the pseudo variety haunting Washington today. (Even mother-in-laws and the DMV also outpolled Congress.)" Lindsey even included a picture of one of the menacing creatures (to be clear, we’re talking about the zombies) in the press release. Despite his disdain for Congress, Lindsey is one of several Republicans running for the 11th District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The district encompasses conservative-leaning communities to the north and west of Atlanta. The current officeholder, Phil Gingrey, R-Marietta, is running for the U.S. Senate. So who’s scarier? Creatures who have returned from the dead to wreak havoc on the world or the men and women in Washington who recently took more than two weeks to resolve a partial government shutdown? PolitiFact Georgia thought it would be fun to find out whether Lindsey was using hyperbole in his quest to convince voters he is a less frightening option that the lot that’s currently in Congress. "The Walking Dead" is a popular TV show that follows survivors of a plague that turns people into zombies. In the show's post-apocalypse Atlanta, the undead stagger through downtown and through the countryside hungry for human innards. Public Policy Polling, a North Carolina-based firm, recently asked 502 registered voters by telephone a series of questions to determine how disliked is Congress. It was taken Oct. 4-6, a few days after the shutdown began. They asked the respondents "What do you have a higher opinion of: Congress or zombies?" Forty-three percent of the respondents said zombies, 37 percent said Congress. Nineteen percent said they weren’t sure. The poll had a 4 percent margin of error. The political party and racial breakdown of the respondents was pretty similar to that of other polls and U.S. Census data. Slightly more men than women answered the poll (53-47 percent), which differs from data that shows the majority of voters are women. There was no breakdown of how many respondents are zombies. Congress was less popular than a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles, jury duty, toenail fungus and cockroaches. The congressional approval rating was 8 percent, which is nearly identical to most polling. Our political leaders in Washington did fare better than homegrown reality star Honey Boo Boo as well as controversial entertainers, such as Lindsey Lohan and Miley Cyrus. This is no cause for celebratory twerking, Congress. Lindsey said he based the claim on the PPP poll, although some of their polls has been said to favor left-leaning candidates. "Based on my anecdotal conversations, if anything, I think the poll numbers may be higher (in favor of zombies)," Lindsey said. We found no other polls on this topic. PolitiFact Georgia had one more question. Why would Lindsey would want to work in a place where his colleagues are so widely despised? "I’ve seen just about every zombie show and, so far, the humans win," Lindsey explained with a hearty laugh. We have no reason to question the PPP’s accuracy on this topic.

pomt-05305	On President Barack Obama’s stimulus	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-didnt-flip-flop-obama-stimulus/	During his 2012 presidential campaign, Mitt Romney has been no fan of the stimulus Democrats passed in 2009. On the third anniversary of its passage, Romney issued a news release titled, "Three Years Later, Obama's Stimulus is Still Failing." Democrats contend Romney has flip-flopped on it. On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos -- a 30-second version and a four-minute version -- that claimed he had flipped on several issues, including the stimulus: On-screen text: "Opposed the stimulus." Video clip of Romney: "I have never supported the president's Recovery Act, alright -- the stimulus. No time, nowhere, nohow." On-screen text: "After he was for it." Different video clip of Romney: "I think there is need for economic stimulus." When we asked the DNC for citations for these clips when the ad was released, they responded that the first ("I have never supported ...") was from a town hall at St. Anselm College in Goffstown, N.H., on Sept. 28, 2011, and the second ("I think there is a need ...") from a Romney appearance on CNN’s Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer on Jan. 4, 2009. We noticed that the CNN interview -- when Romney said, "I think there is need for economic stimulus" -- took place before Obama had been sworn into office and therefore before there was much detail about it. The transcript indicated Romney was talking in general terms. Blitzer said that Obama, then president-elect, was "talking about a $750 billion economic stimulus package. He wants it to be passed as soon as possible. It's unclear if whether it can be passed before he's inaugurated on January 20th. What do you think about this proposal?" Romney replied, "Well, I frankly wish that the last Congress (had) dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president could have signed that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time. And that's one of the reasons why I think a stimulus program is needed." He continued, "I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies. But let's not make this a Christmas tree of all of the favors for various politicians who have helped out the Obama campaign, giving them special projects. That would be wrong. You'll see Republicans fight that tooth and nail if that happens. Let's do what's right for the economy, and let's not do what's a political expedient move." Our ruling It’s misleading to say that Romney flip-flopped on supporting "the president's Recovery Act." At the time of the CNN interview, no Obama stimulus bill had been introduced, much less enacted. With such complex bills, the devil’s in the details. But before Obama took office, Romney had spoken in favor of a stimulus -- particularly if the stimulus in question had been passed when a Republican was in the White House. We rate this a Half Flip.

pomt-08471	John Kitzhaber is the only pro-choice candidate in the race for governor.	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/13/planned-parenthood-pac/planned-parenthood-pac-oregon-says-chris-dudley-an/	Oregon is liberal when it comes to access to abortion. It’s among 16 states that do not require parental notification or consent for teen abortions. Oregon does not mandate counseling or limit when an abortion can be performed. Planned Parenthood PAC of Oregon sent out a letter this month claiming that Democrat John Kitzhaber is the only pro-choice candidate in the race for governor. That means Chris Dudley, the Republican in the race, is anti-choice. The campaign letter reads: "In contrast, Chris Dudley wants to roll back a woman's right to choose. He supports restrictions that Oregon voters have rejected multiple times, and that threaten women's health. And Chris Dudley has singled out ‘abstinence’ education as a way to address unintended pregnancy. He is out of step with Oregon values and cares more about catering to extreme positions than providing real education and access to birth control." Two questions came to mind. Does Dudley really want to "roll back" a woman’s right to choose? And if he is open to restrictions -- such as notifying parents before a minor opts for an abortion -- does that automatically mean he is not pro-choice? PolitiFact Oregon asked Planned Parenthood to share the goods. Roey Thorpe, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, provided a letter that Dudley sent June 2. In it, he declines to answer the group’s questionnaire and explains his position on abortion. "I believe that abortion should remain legal -- but limited. I do not support the public funding of abortion. As governor, I will not propose new legal restrictions on abortion, but I would be open to proposals for parental notification for minors who seek abortions, limits on late-term abortions and efforts to reduce abortion through education and abstinence." He added that he would not use a single-issue litmus test when nominating judges, appointing board members or approving legislation. OK, that sounds clear, but not crystal. For example, does that mean he would spearhead legislation if it’s regarding parental notification, or just entertain the idea if it comes from elsewhere? We followed up with the Dudley campaign. Spokesman Jake Suski said Dudley would not propose any legislation related to abortion or reproductive rights. But if legislation landed on his desk related to parental notification or late-term abortions, Dudley would be "open to signing it. It doesn’t guarantee he would sign it." Suski also said Dudley identifies himself as "pro-choice." Thorpe says any effort to restrict access or curb the law means a person is not pro-choice. "Rolling back the rights that women already have in Oregon is not a centrist position," she said. "Safe and legal abortion is a right that people have." Thorpe also cited Dudley’s singling out of abstinence education as a sign that he’s on the wrong side of the issue. But Sharon Kitzhaber, the former first lady, was a founder and board member of the STARS Foundation in Oregon. That stands for Students Today Aren’t Ready for Sex, and its mission, according to this archived press release, was to "help reduce teenage pregnancies by postponing teenage sexual involvement." In any case, the Oregon Right to Life people aren’t happy with Dudley, either. He didn’t fill out their questionnaire and the group declined to recommend -- much less endorse -- him in the general election. "He wrote them a letter," sniffed Gayle Atteberry, director of Oregon Right to Life, referring to Planned Parenthood. "He didn't even write us a letter." Dudley believes -- and we think many people concur -- that he is pro-choice because he believes abortion should be legal. We recognize, though, that there isn’t universal agreement on the definition of pro-choice. Some abortion rights supporters are against any restrictions. Others who define themselves as pro-choice do support limitations, on late term abortions, for example. Dudley admittedly has not said much on this issue, and that’s part of what’s driving Thorpe and Planned Parenthood. He said he’s open to restrictions but doesn’t have an agenda to roll back reproductive rights. Dudley mentioned abstinence in his letter to Planned Parenthood, but Kitzhaber’s former wife championed abstinence education and nobody marked her as anti-choice. Certainly, Kitzhaber is more adamant about his stance on abortion and reproductive rights. He has the endorsement of Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon, which traditionally endorses Democrats. And when he was governor, he vetoed a 1999 bill that would have required physicians to notify parents before providing abortion care to minors. Planned Parenthood PAC’s statement ignores critical facts. The claim is Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Planned Parenthood PAC	None	None	None	2010-10-13T06:00:00	2010-10-06	['None']

pomt-03845	The fiscal cliff agreement was "the largest tax increase in history."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/15/paul-ryan/largest-tax-hike-ever-fiscal-cliff-deal-paul-ryan-/	In 2011 and 2012, conservatives maligned Obamacare as the largest tax increase in history. Now House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican and renowned numbers cruncher, is making the same claim about a different piece of legislation. In an interview broadcast March 3, 2013, on "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a public affairs show on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee, Gousha asked Ryan: "You had said that you can’t agree to the president’s call for closing tax loopholes because it would kill tax reform. What do you mean by that?" Alluding to the New Year’s Day 2013 compromise that averted what had been termed the "fiscal cliff," Ryan began his response by saying: "So, as you know, the president eight weeks ago got the largest tax increase in history; he got a big tax increase just eight weeks ago. And that gives us certain revenue lines to do tax reform. We have long proposed, in all the budgets I’ve written, to plug loopholes to lower tax rates, to bring down tax rates for Americans, for families, for businesses, to create jobs, to grow the economy." Ryan made the same largest tax increase in history claim three days earlier in an interview on CNBC’s "Squawk Box." But the 2012 vice-presidential candidate, a fiscal hawk, voted for the legislation that averted the fiscal cliff. So, did that deal really impose the biggest tax increase ever? Fiscal cliff The bipartisan fiscal cliff agreement staved off big income tax increases on most Americans and prevented large cuts in spending for the Pentagon and other government programs. But it also allowed income taxes to rise for the first time in two decades, in this case for those with household incomes of over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples. The deal was a victory for Obama, who had run for re-election pledging to raise taxes on the wealthy. Some Republicans praised the compromise for cementing income tax cuts for people below the $400,000 and $450,000 levels; those temporary lower rates, put in place under President George W. Bush, were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. Ryan’s evidence Asked for evidence to back Ryan's claim, Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert said the fiscal cliff bill is estimated to raise $650 billion over 10 years and that the "nominal dollar impact" makes it the largest-ever tax hike. He cited a 2006 U.S. Department of Treasury paper on major tax increases. But by nominal increases, Seifert is referring to the raw dollar amount -- which, given inflation, is not a good way for comparing tax increases over time. Especially for a period as long as "in history." The better way is to measure a tax increase as a percentage of gross domestic product, which shows the relative impact of the increase at the time it was enacted. Better measure In 2011, PolitiFact Florida rated as False a claim by GOP Florida Gov. Rick Scott that Obamacare was the biggest tax increase in history; and in 2012, PolitiFact National rated as Pants on Fire a more extreme claim by Rush Limbaugh that the law was "the largest tax increase in the history of the world." Our colleagues used 2019 as a baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of Obama’s health care reform law will be in effect. They divided the estimated revenue increase in 2019 -- $104 billion -- by the projected gross domestic product for 2019 -- just under $21.2 trillion. That meant the Obamacare tax increase would amount to 0.49 percent of total GDP. Using the same Treasury paper Ryan cited, our colleagues found that Obamacare did not rank among the top five tax increases in history, but it was roughly tied for fifth among tax increases since 1968, which is considered the modern era in terms of taxation. Three tax hikes -- in 1980, 1990 and 1993 -- all were in the ballpark with Obamacare. The largest modern-era tax hike -- at 1.09 percent of gross domestic product -- was a measure adopted in 1968. So, how about the fiscal cliff? What the experts say We ran Ryan’s argument past three experts. Each said the fiscal cliff bill is not the largest-ever tax hike in terms of a percentage of gross domestic product. Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, told us that using Ryan’s figure -- $650 billion over 10 years -- means the fiscal cliff tax hike amounts to only one-third of 1 percent (0.33) of projected GDP, which is estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to be $206 trillion for that period (2013-2022). That’s less than the Obamacare rate of 0.49 percent, which as we pointed out, is smaller than a number of other tax increases. Kathy Ruffing of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities gave an estimate similar to Williams’. She said revenue raised by the fiscal cliff bill would amount to 0.4 percent by the fifth year. That’s lower than measures adopted in the 1980s and 1990s under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, according to an updated version of the Treasury paper Ryan cited. William McBride of the business-backed Tax Foundation said that in "nominal dollar terms," the fiscal cliff tax hike is the largest in history, but "certainly not as a share of GDP." Our rating Ryan said the fiscal cliff agreement is "the largest tax increase in history."

pomt-12561	"Every day, four North Carolinians die from a medication or drug overdose."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/apr/13/greg-murphy/how-many-people-die-every-day-drug-overdoses-north/	The fight to limit the availability of prescription painkillers in North Carolina is being led in part by the only medical doctor in the N.C. General Assembly. Rep. Greg Murphy, a Republican from Greenville who is also a urology surgeon, is the primary sponsor of what’s being called the STOP Act. That stands for "Strengthen Opioid Misuse Prevention." In the past several weeks, he has promoted his bill with a sobering statistic. "Every day, four North Carolinians die from a medication or drug overdose," Murphy said in early March, when he first introduced the bill. "I prescribe these medications daily and I see the problem first hand." Murphy has often been quoted or paraphrased in the news repeating some version of that claim about the deadliness of drug overdoses, most recently on Monday when the bill passed the House of Representatives unanimously. It’s a popular argument for a popular bill, which has support from lawmakers of both parties as well as a vocal ally in Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein. In addition to other provisions, the bill would reduce the amount of pain pills a doctor could prescribe to most patients on their initial visits. The idea is that fewer pills will lead to fewer opportunities for abuse or addiction. The STOP Act passed the N.C. House 114-0 and is now in the Senate. But we wondered whether the morbid statistic that’s driving much of the conversation is actually correct. How deadly are prescription pills? In 2015, according to the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, 1,370 people died of unintentional poisonings. Of those deaths, 93 percent (1,274) were drug overdoses – everything from painkillers to cocaine to heroin. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com That’s an average of 3.5 deaths daily, which is in line with Murphy’s claim of four a day. Nearly the same number of people died in 2015 from unintentional drug overdoses as died from gunshots. If you also include intentional overdoses, then drugs were deadlier than both guns and car crashes. A 2016 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study found the counties with the highest rates of drug overdose deaths are all in western or southeastern North Carolina. But even though Murphy phrased his claim broadly about all drug overdoses, his bill doesn’t target street drugs like cocaine and heroin. The STOP Act is only aimed at limiting the supply of prescription painkillers. Prescription pills were involved in 738 unintentional overdose deaths in 2015. That’s two a day – certainly troubling, but only about half of Murphy’s claim. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com However, experts agree there’s a strong link between painkillers and heroin, since they give the same type of high, and heroin tends to be cheaper and more widely available to addicts. "When we talk to people who are injecting heroin, they all got there through prescription opioids," said Steve Marshall, an epidemiologist and director of UNC-Chapel Hill’s Injury Prevention Research Center. "It's not some of them. It's all of them." Marshall said it would be fair for Murphy to count heroin overdose deaths when promoting the STOP Act, if not cocaine overdose deaths. Cocaine, unlike heroin and painkillers, is not an opioid. Just under 1,000 North Carolinians died from an unintentional opioid overdose in 2015 (see here for county-level data). That’s an average of 2.7 per day – again, not exactly what Murphy said, but not far off. Last year California medical company Castlight Health ranked four North Carolina cities among the top 25 nationwide for painkiller abuse. Wilmington, the company’s study said, had the country’s highest rate of opioid abuse. The report found more than half of the prescriptions issued for painkillers in Wilmington are being abused. Kay Sanford, another UNC-Chapel Hill epidemiologist, is credited with discovering the rising trend of prescription pill addiction and overdoses in North Carolina in the early 2000s. She said many people have been replacing painkillers with heroin in the last few years. "The number of people dying from prescription opioids, in North Carolina and nationwide, has gone down while the number of people dying from heroin has gone up," Sanford said. "So when you combine those two, it's basically the same number." Yet in Murphy’s favor, at least one piece of brand-new research has made the argument that cocaine should be included in these counts, too. In February researchers with several federal government agencies published a paper that argued cocaine overdoses can be linked back to the increased use of opioids like painkillers. "Opioids, primarily heroin and synthetic opioids, have been driving the recent increase in cocaine-related overdose deaths," the study concluded. Our ruling Rep. Greg Murphy has been promoting his STOP Act, which would limit access to prescription painkillers, by saying that drug overdoses kill four people a day in North Carolina. That’s basically accurate (it’s 3.5 per day) but prescription pills alone are only responsible for 2 deaths a day – half of what Murphy said. However, there’s wide agreement in the scientific community that for such counts it makes sense to lump heroin and painkillers together (which cause 2.7 deaths a day) and some research has argued for including cocaine deaths, too. Even if his statistics are slightly inflated, Murphy’s general point – that opioid addiction is leading to multiple deaths per day in North Carolina – is correct. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08738	"Forty-five percent of those who've been unemployed, they've been unemployed for six months or longer."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/31/donna-brazile/donna-brazile-says-45-percent-unemployed-have-been/	In a discussion of the economy during the Aug. 29, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile addressed the plight of the long-term unemployed. She said that "45 percent of those who've been unemployed, they've been unemployed for six months or longer. They desperately need the skills and the tools to get back into the workplace." We thought we'd check to see if Brazile was right. We turned to the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates the national unemployment rate as well as a host of other labor-related statistics. We found two relevant numbers that are published monthly: the seasonally adjusted number of unemployed Americans age 16 and over, and the subset of that group that has been unemployed for at least 27 weeks, or a little over six months. We divided the second number by the first for each month of the Obama presidency -- January 2009 to July 2010. That produced the percentage at any given time of all unemployed workers who have been unemployed for more than six months. Brazile is on solid ground when assessing the past three months. The percentage of unemployed workers who were jobless for more than six months was 45 percent in May 2010, 46 percent in June 2010 and 45 percent in July 2010. But for most of the Obama presidency, the ratio was lower. It climbed slowly, starting at 23 percent in January 2009. It hit 30 percent in June 2009 and 40 percent in December 2009 before cracking 45 percent in May 2010. Brazile's only error here was to use the wrong verb tense. The way she phrased it suggested that 45 percent of those who have been unemployed during the current recession were unemployed for at least six months. That's actually been true only for the past three months -- that is, 17 months into the Obama presidency and 32 months into the recession. A more accurate way of phrasing it would have been "45 percent of those who are now unemployed, they've been unemployed for six months or longer." Of course, Brazile's grammatical slip-up should not undercut the seriousness of the economic statistic she's citing. Her point about the long-term unemployed is generally accurate even if her encapsulation of it is a little misleading. On balance, then, we rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-10723	The form students fill out to get college financial aid is "longer than the form to get U.S. citizenship."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/20/bill-richardson/citizenship-110-financial-aid-102-/	As part of his education platform speech, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson lays into how tough it can be to get financial aid for college. "The forms that families have to fill out to get college aid, the (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), is 127 questions. That's longer than the form to get U.S. citizenship," he said. "Something's wrong when it's more complicated to get money for school than it is to become an American citizen. I will tear up those forms and replace them with a postcard-sized form." His idea — and his numbers — come from a Brookings Institution position paper called "College Grants on a Postcard," his campaign says. But it's not quite clear that the paper, and hence the candidate, gets it right. The FAFSA includes 102 numbered questions, some complicated, some as basic as last name and first name. Yes, those count as separate questions. You don't have to answer them all, depending on where you live. (It's a universal form, so some items apply only to Californians, and others only to Tennesseans, while others are general.) Six questions rely on worksheets that have questions. But that's backup documentation, not the form. Confused, we asked the paper's author, Harvard associate professor Susan Dynarski, how she came up with her number and what we missed. "We counted the questions," Dynarski responded in an e-mail. "There are 127." Dissatisfied, we turned to the Center for College Planning in New Hampshire, where a spokeswoman came in closer to the government's number. "There are 100 questions involved on the form," she wrote. (We don't know which ones she didn't count.) Is that longer than the form to get U.S. citizenship? Nope. By our count, Form N-400 from the Department of Homeland Security has 110 questions (first and last name count as one, not two). And though it doesn't include worksheets like FAFSA, it has its share of complicated questions. It's no easy task to document every trip of 24 hours or more outside the United States in the past five years. At a score of 110-102, we rule Richardson's statement False.

pomt-05678	"The total (state) payroll has gone down. The total amount of the number of workers in the state has gone down. I like the fact that the bulk of that is just by retirements."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/15/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-states-payroll-smaller-and-retire/	Gov. John Kasich and other Republicans often talk about shrinking the size of government and spending less taxpayer money. Personnel costs are one measure of government spending that is both easy to understand and significant. Ohio’s payroll last year was more than $3 billion. Kasich recently was asked about the state’s payroll during a question-and-answer session with reporters after a public appearance in Columbus on March 2. The question was posed to Kasich shortly after the state released its payroll data in response to a public records request. A reporter suggested to Kasich the payroll had decreased and the governor rattled off some more statistics on the state’s workforce. The Ohio Capital Blog recorded video of the exchange and archived it online. "The total (state) payroll has gone down. The total amount of the number of workers in the state has gone down. I like the fact that the bulk of that is just by retirements." The new payroll figures show that the state is becoming more efficient, the governor went on to say. Kasich, who took office in January 2011, said the declines in payroll and workforce show Ohio can do more with less. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the governor’s claim, given the general interest in government spending and Kasich’s boastful interpretation of the new payroll data. We checked with the Ohio Department of Administrative Services, which keeps payroll figures. The department also provided figures for the number of state workers and the number of retirements, so we were able to check all three aspects of the governor’s claim. It turns out that Kasich was wrong to say the state’s payroll went down. He was correct, however, to say the state has fewer workers and that retirement is the main reason for the reduction in workforce. The state’s payroll in 2010, the year before Kasich took office, was $3.083 billion, according to the department of administrative services. The payroll figure includes payments for overtime, sick leave, vacation leave and other forms of compensation. In 2011, the state’s payroll was $3.084 billion – an increase of about $1.4 million, or 0.045 percent. One factor for the payroll bump was the end of a policy halfway through the year that forced state workers to take unpaid days off. The policy saved the state $104 million in 2010 and about $48 million last year. When explaining Kasich’s erroneous claim that payroll decreased, Rob Nichols, a spokesman for the governor, cited a media report published the day Kasich met with reporters that said payroll decreased. But Nichols did not dispute the figures provided to us by the Department of Administrative Services that showed a slight increase. Although Kasich was off when talking about the state payroll, he was right about the decrease in state workers and the reason most of them aren’t working for the state anymore. The department of administrative services said Ohio employed 54,906 workers at the very start of this year and 58,304 a year earlier – a difference of 3,398 workers. The department also said 2,909 workers retired in 2011. So Kasich was correct to say the "bulk" of workers no longer with the state left due to retirement. Where does that leave us? The governor was partially accurate. Of the three parts in Kasich’s claim, he was accurate on two: the number of workers on the state payroll has decreased and the biggest reason is jobs emptied by retirements. He missed, though, on the main part of his statement, that the state had decreased its payroll. Actually, it has grown, but very slightly at less than five one-hundredths of a percent. That’s an important detail to known, given that he went on to boast about the state’s efficiency under his administration. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Half True.

pomt-09153	Presidents Hoover, Truman and Eisenhower collectively ordered the deportation of at least 15 million illegal aliens.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/10/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-three-presidents-deported-total-/	In the hot-button immigration debate, some who oppose crackdowns on illegal immigrants suggest that it would be logistically and economically impossible for federal authorities to deport perhaps 10 million people to their country of origin. We recently received an unsigned chain e-mail in our inbox that took that argument head-on, suggesting that there's ample precedent in American history for mass deportations of illegal immigrants. Here are excerpts of the e-mail, with original syntax intact. "What did Hoover, Truman, and Eisenhower have in common? ... Back during The Great Depression, President Herbert Hoover ordered the deportation of ALL illegal aliens in order to make jobs available to American citizens that desperately needed work. Harry Truman deported over two million Illegal's after WWII to create jobs for returning veterans. And then again in 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower deported 13 million Mexican Nationals! The program was called 'Operation Wetback'.. It was done so WWII and Korean Veterans would have a better chance at jobs. It took 2 Years, but they deported them! Now. ... if they could deport the illegal's back then -- they could sure do it today." We checked with a range of experts, including historians of American immigration, to see whether the e-mail was accurate. Here's what we found: • On President Hoover: The e-mail is partly correct, but somewhat exaggerated. During the early 1930s, there was a "repatriation" campaign in which some cities and counties, such as Los Angeles and Detroit, returned illegal aliens to their country of origin, mostly Mexico. The biggest impetus was the Great Depression and its impact on the availability of jobs. "In the 'repatriation,' about 1 million persons of Mexican ancestry, at the encouragement/coercion of state and local governments, with federal support, were 'returned' to Mexico," said Kevin Johnson, an immigration specialist who is dean of the University of California (Davis) School of Law. "Persons who 'looked' Mexican in public places, such as parks and plazas, were arrested and taken in buses, trains, and cars to the U.S.-Mexico border." Our experts estimated that between 400,000 and 1 million people were shifted across the border as a result of this effort, including an unknown but likely significant number of American-born dependents of illegals who were actually U.S. citizens, as well as other people who were in the U.S. legally. Because the motivating force was local rather than national, some of our experts said it was a stretch for the author of the e-mail to primarily cite Hoover as the leader of the effort (or his successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who initially continued the effort before cutting off federal funds). Still, the federal government was involved. Beyond that, the e-mail's description of this period is not far off. • On President Truman: Our experts were unaware of any evidence to back up the assertion that Truman deported over 2 million illegal immigrants after World War II in order to create jobs. From 1946 to 1952 -- from the end of the war until the end of Truman's presidency -- the U.S. government recorded the entry of less than 1.5 million legal immigrants, many of them persons of European origin fleeing the war or the Holocaust. Experts we spoke to said that it wasn't credible that an even larger number of people could have been deported during that period. • On President Eisenhower: "Operation Wetback" was real, but the numbers of deportations cited in the e-mail are wildly high. Beginning in World War II -- during a severe shortage of workers on the home front -- the federal government instituted the Bracero program, which brought Mexican workers into the United States to fill jobs that would not otherwise be filled. The Braceros, as they were called, were in the U.S. legally, but the government often looked the other way when companies illegally brought their own Mexican workers into the country. Workers brought in outside the Bracero program, combined with Mexicans who had crossed the border illegally on their own, were the targets of "Operation Wetback." In 1953 and 1954, under Eisenhower, the federal government undertook the operation, which mirrored the Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s. The intention was to target illegal immigrants, but as with the earlier expulsions, some U.S. citizens of Mexican ancestry were also caught up in the dragnet. Determining the number of people who were removed from the U.S. as a result of "Operation Wetback" is tricky because some people who would have otherwise been subject to deportation left the country "voluntarily," a step ahead of the authorities. The estimates we've seen ranged from 100,000 forced removals to 1.3 million. But no expert we spoke to said that the 13 million figure was credible. "I have never seen an adequate explanation" of even the 1 million figure, said David G. Gutierrez, a historian at the University of California (San Diego). "It is much more likely in my view that the stepped-up enforcement of the border increased apprehension numbers for a time, but that the status quo was soon restored and unauthroized labor was simply working more completely underground." Official federal statistics show that during the whole decade of the 1950s, the federal government formally removed 150,000 illegal aliens and recorded about 3.9 million "voluntary departures." So even a whole decade worth of deportations, calculated in the most generous way possible, gets us to less than one-third of the total cited in the e-mail. Scott Wong, a Williams College historian, said that there is "some truth in this post -- that the government has deported illegal immigrants in the past -- but it was never 13 million over two years. The author is very sloppy and loose with the facts, and completely ignores the historical context as to why there are illegal immigrants." Even Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group critical of illegal immigration, said that while "the idea of the e-mail is correct, the numbers are way, way too high." In all, then, the e-mail is fairly accurate about the policy under Hoover, flat wrong about the policy under Truman, and dramatically exaggerated when talking about Eisenhower. If you look at the core historical facts the e-mail seeks to communicate -- that Presidents Hoover, Truman, and Eisenhower collectively ordered the deportation of at least 15 million illegal aliens -- all the evidence suggests that its numbers are nowhere near correct. The official total from 1930 to 1960 is 477,000 formal removals and 5.4 million who left voluntarily. That 30-year period includes the entirety of Roosevelt's terms, not just the three presidents cited in the e-mail. Added together, the number who left would be just under 6 million -- less than half of what the e-mail claims -- and about 90 percent of them were not deported. It would be too generous to call the e-mail Barely True. We rate it False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-06-10T13:39:53	2010-06-09	['Dwight_D._Eisenhower', 'Harry_S._Truman']
pomt-03935	Federal spending on entitlements "is projected to consume all revenue by 2045."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/21/josh-mandel/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel-says-entitlement-spendi/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich was bound to tick off someone when he announced this month that he wanted to expand Medicaid enrollment, using money from the federal government. From a political angle, it meant the Republican governor was embracing a component of "Obamacare" and trying to give about 275,000 more low-income and disabled Ohioans subsidized health care, just as Democrats wanted. From a fiscal angle, it meant the federal government would cover the state’s costs of providing care for this bigger group. But some conservatives noted the eventual roll-off in federal money, and they said the feds could simply turn off the spigot someday if they wanted, sticking Ohio with unaffordable costs. Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel raised a related concern that caught our eye: Money for Medicaid might seem like a gift from Washington, but it could help put the entire nation more deeply in a financial hole. Urging the state legislature to reject Medicaid expansion, Mandel on Feb. 11 wrote to state House Speaker William G. Batchelder and Senate President Keith Faber and included this statement: "The federal government has an approximate $16.4 trillion national debt, and entitlement spending alone is projected to consume all revenue by 2045." Mandel’s debt figure was actually a tad low. The national debt, including money owed to investors and foreign governments as well as obligations owed from one federal account to another, was approaching $16.5 trillion -- and has since hit it -- the day he wrote his letter, according to Treasury Department data. But we wondered about Mandel’s claim that, based on projections, entitlement spending by 2045 could consume all the tax money the federal government takes in. We asked Mandel’s press secretary, Chris Berry, to tell us more about these projections. Berry told us they came from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, and that the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, had used them as well. Berry sent us a CBO spreadsheet with long-term budget projections, and offered to arrange a conference call so that he, another Mandel aide and a Heritage analyst could discuss the data with us. We had the conversation, chiefly with Drew Gonshorowski, a Heritage policy analyst. But we also checked the figures independently, downloading them from the CBOs website, where they appear as a supplement to the CBO’s "Long Term Budget Outlook." This is a projection the CBO makes annually, and the latest was in June. The CBO is a primary source for all manner of budget and spending data, used by Republicans and Democrats alike. But before we get to the CBO figures, it’s important to point out that the CBO projects future revenue and spending using two different sets of assumptions. The first assumes that whatever is current law will continue into the future unless there is an expiration date. Income tax rates are a good example of this because they pertain directly to government revenue -- partly the subject of Mandel’s claim -- making the concept pertinent and easy to understand.. Many tax rates, including those passed by Congress during the presidency of George W. Bush and continued under President Barack Obama, are imposed for a specific period. When the CBO runs a projection based on the current law, it assumes that tax rates without expiration dates will continue but those that are scheduled to expire will, in fact, expire. If lower rates expire, you could assume that people will pay more money to the government. There are additional economic variables built into the numbers, but you get the idea: Higher taxes mean, in these projections, more government money. So back to Mandel’s claim: Using the CBO’s current-law projections, he would be wrong. That is, tax revenue would provide more money. This is not to say that by 2045, the year Mandel cited, entitlements would not consume a greater share of revenue than today, crowding out other priorities as health care costs rise and the retiree ranks swell. But under this projection, entitlements would not consume every revenue dollar. So was Mandel way off base? Actually, no. Current-law projections can be very wrong, and the CBO readily acknowledged this in its 109-page budget outlook. As it turned out, most of the income tax rates that were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 did not end up expiring, for example. Congress on Jan. 1 extended them in its so-called fiscal-cliff deal. The CBO knew all along that this was fairly likely -- and factored for it in an alternative set of projections. These alternative projections are what Mandel’s aides and Heritage used to make their case. The alternative projections were based on a realistic understanding of politics and policy -- and one such understanding was that Congress was almost certain to extend many if not all tax cuts. With a few exceptions, notably higher rates on families earning more than $450,000, that is close to what happened. So what did the alternative projections show about revenues and entitlements in 2045 -- that is, about Mandel’s claim? In 2045, federal revenues could equal 18.5 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product, according to this CBO view. That includes all sources of federal revenue, including income taxes and corporate taxes as well as payroll taxes that are supposed to cover Social Security and a portion of Medicare (but will be insufficient, for reasons we need not get into here). Against that, Social Security spending could equal 6 percent of GDP, and Medicare 7.6 percent. Medicaid, children’s health insurance and insurance subsidies for the Affordable Care Act could be the equivalent of 4.1 percent of GDP. Put together, the entitlements would equal 17.7 percent of GDP. Mandel said that spending on entitlements "is projected to consume all revenue by 2045." While 17.7 percent of GDP is not 18.5 percent, it represents nearly 96 percent of the revenue -- extremely close. A 96 percent score in school would get you an A, As for the merits of using the alternative projections, CBO itself noted on page 3 of its report: "Many budget analysts believe that the extended alternative fiscal scenario is more representative of the fiscal policies that are now (or have recently been) in effect than is the extended baseline scenario." Before we rule, it is important to note that Mandel made his statement in February, eight months after the CBO projections were published. In that time, some events turned out slightly differently than the CBO anticipated. And some groups question even the alternative CBO projections for other reasons. The CBO assumes, for example, "that income taxes do not increase as a share of GDP after ten years," Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told us in an email. Yet that ignores "the growth in tax revenues that occurs automatically as real economic growth slowly moves taxpayers into higher tax brackets," he said. The CBO also likely overstates future deficits, he said, by assuming that current Medicare spending controls will not continue after 10 years. These are among the reasons Van de Water concludes that Mandel’s statement is "likely to be an exaggeration." Yet Mandel clearly said these were projections, not absolute certainties. While he would be wrong under one set of projections, he chose the set of projections that, as the CBO noted, are believed by many analysts to be more realistic. That is an important point. Will they turn out to be an exaggeration? That’s possible. All sides, including Mandel, agree that efforts will be made to raise revenues or reduce the entitlement spending to keep this projected collision from occurring. The CBO cites the need, too. The political parties just disagree on how much of each is needed. This additional information about the CBO figures is helpful in fully understanding Mandel’s claim. Yet his language was clear: He was citing projections, not certainty. When a claim is accurate but needs additional information to be fully understood, PolitiFact rates it Mostly True.

Under the Budget Control Act, the Florida National Guard which currently has about 12,000 troops could lose up to 1,000 soldiers and airmen if cuts are distributed evenly across the states. The cuts could start in 2015. As Nelson talked about the need for Guard troops in states that face hurricanes, he snuck in a smidgen of one upmanship over New York. "My state of Florida is now the third-largest state," Nelson said on April 8. "We have surpassed New York in population. But New York and Florida also have in common the threat of hurricanes." Do more people live in Florida than New York? We didn’t think our own senator had that right. New York vs. Florida numbers On Dec. 30, the Census Bureau released estimates through July 2013 which showed that New York narrowly held on to its spot as the third most-populous state behind California and Texas. New York had 19,651,127 residents while Florida had 19,552,860. That means that New York has 98,267 more residents than Florida. The next such release of data will be in December. (We will rely on the census to make an apples-to-apples comparison between Florida and New York. However Florida’s office of Economic and Demographic Research has a slightly lower figure for Florida’s population: it placed it at 19,485,270 as of February 2014. The state projects we will surpass the 20 million mark in 2016.) But the story doesn’t end there. The Miami Herald reported on Dec. 30 that demographers said that Florida was on track to soon overtake New York because Florida was growing more quickly. "It’s quite clear that Florida, in terms of overall population, is going to overtake New York," Ira Sheskin, who chairs the Department of Geography and Regional Studies at the University of Miami, told the Miami Herald. "It won’t take much longer." Both states have received a steady stream of immigrants, said Stan Smith, of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida. "But in terms of (domestic) migration, more people leave New York than move into New York," Smith told the Miami Herald in December. Tracking when Florida will surpass New York is more than just interesting trivia and bragging rights. Size matters when it comes to doling out billions of dollars in federal money. So why did Nelson think it had already happened? Nelson’s spokesman pointed to a March article in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune about new growth estimates released for the Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties for July 2010 through July 2013. The article stated: "As a result, Florida last month likely edged New York to become the third most populous state in the nation, based on bureau estimates and a Herald-Tribune analysis of the data," the article stated. "During that three-year period, Florida’s population grew by an average of 645 people daily, while New York’s grew by some of 231 a day." "If you look at the recent trends, it certainly appeared that Florida would pass New York somewhere between July 2013 and June of 2014," Smith told the Herald-Tribune. We sent Nelson’s statement and the Herald-Tribune article to a few demographers in Florida and New York and asked if they thought Nelson could declare Florida already in the third place spot. All of the experts told us that we would need to wait for official numbers from the census. "Florida will probably pass New York this year, but there is no guarantee," Smith told PolitiFact. "You will need to wait for proof," Andrew Beveridge, a professor at Queens College and an expert on census data, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. "Maybe something like ‘Most likely.’ " Whether Florida is now ahead of New York remains unclear, University of Miami demographer Ira Sheskin told PolitiFact Florida in an email. "Population change is Births - Deaths + In-migration - Out-migration. Florida grew 4 percent from April 1, 2010, to July 1, 2013, and New York at 1.4 percent. So we will eventually overtake New York. But even given that we are 8 months past the last Census Bureau estimate, it is not clear that we have yet surpassed New York." Amy Baker, the coordinator of Florida’s Office of Economic and Demographic Research, said EDR believes based on its own data that Florida will surpass New York "sometime in late 2015 or early 2016. If the Census Bureau has a better handle on our growth than we do, the date would be sooner. But even then you would need the next set of census data to confirm." Our ruling Nelson said, "My state of Florida is now the third-largest state. We have surpassed New York in population." Based on official information from the U.S. Census, as of July 2013, New York was in third place in population with about 100,000 more residents than Florida. Demographers have predicted that Florida will soon overtake New York and it’s possible that it has already happened, but demographers said we won’t know for certain until the census releases updated information later this year. We rate politicians’ claims based on information available at the time, so at this point we can’t declare for certain that Florida has inched ahead of New York. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00431	"Half of everyone that’s here illegally (in the U.S.) came here legally on a visa and have overstayed their visa."	mostly true	/california/statements/2018/aug/24/kevin-mccarthy/mostly-true-visa-overstays-account-half-all-people/	The debate over illegal immigration in America most often centers on the unlawful crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border. President Trump frequently stokes that debate as he did with this tweet in June 2018: "We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country." But Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed there’s another factor — visa overstays — that accounts for half of the people in the country illegally. "Half of everyone that’s here illegally (in the US) came here legally on a visa and have overstayed their visa," McCarthy, a Republican from Bakersfield, said at a Public Policy Institute of California event in Sacramento on Aug. 15, 2018. McCarthy made his claim at a Public Policy Institute of California event in Sacramento in August 2018. That’s not to say McCarthy, a close Trump ally, was breaking with the president’s hardline immigration stance. He told the crowd he supports Trump’s border wall and opposes sanctuary cities. PolitiFact and its affiliates have fact-checked statements similar to McCarthy’s on visa overstays in the past. They’ve found those statements are generally correct. But they’ve also noted that the supporting evidence is now somewhat dated. For this fact check, we examined whether current available data support McCarthy’s claim. Our research Past fact-checks, including one by PolitiFact Virginia in 2016, have relied on a 2006 Pew Research Center report. It estimated "nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials." Each year, the United States grants thousands of temporary visas for foreign students, tourists and workers. They can last from a few weeks to several years. The Pew report put the share of visa overstayers at "as much as 45 percent of the total unauthorized migrant population." The study, however, used data more than two decades old from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, an agency that doesn’t exist anymore and whose functions were folded into the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. "The problem is that neither the INS nor its successor, the Department of Homeland Security, have provided updated statistics on the percentage of undocumented immigrants who overstayed visas since that aging study," PolitiFact Virginia reported in 2016. More recent data Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us in an email that recent DHS reports include data limited to foreign visitors who arrived by air and sea crossings, but not by land. "They do not tell you anything about the full population of overstays," she wrote. She said a 2017 study by the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank, is more helpful. That report estimated visa overstays in 2014 accounted for 42 percent of the total undocumented population, or about 4.5 million people. It also projected that overstays made up about two-thirds of the total number of people who became unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. that year. McCarthy’s claim of "half" is not far from the 42 percent figure. Asked to support the congressman’s statement, McCarthy’s spokesman pointed to a recent article by The Washington Post that cited the Center for Migration Studies report. The center’s report said its figures "are based primarily on detailed estimates of the undocumented population in 2014 compiled by (the Center for Migration Studies) and estimates of overstays for 2015 derived by DHS." Share of overstays on the rise? Given the past decade’s dramatic and well-documented decline in illegal Southern border crossings, there’s a strong case that visa overstayers now account for a larger share of the overall total of unauthorized immigrants. In April, we rated ‘True,’ Gov. Jerry Brown’s claim in a letter to the Trump administration that "immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years." Brown’s office cited U.S. Border Patrol figures showing nearly 304,000 arrests in 2017 across the borders of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The previous low was just under 264,000 in 1971. Arrest totals along the Southern border reached well over 1 million annually in the 1980s and 1990s. They peaked at 1.64 million in 2000. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, told PolitiFact Virginia in 2016 that while estimates of undocumented immigrants have been stable since 2007, the number of people entering illegally across the southwestern U.S. border has "collapsed." That means that the proportion of those overstaying their visas likely is on the rise, he said in 2016. We asked Nowrasteh whether that still holds true in 2018. "Yes, about half of illegal immigrants currently are overstays," he told us by email. Our ruling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy recently claimed "Half of everyone that’s here illegally (in the US) came here legally on a visa and have overstayed their visa." Past fact checks found this statement and ones like it are generally correct. But they cautioned that the claims mainly rely on figures from a 2006 report, which used federal immigration data from the mid-1990s. More recent Department of Homeland Security reports don’t offer the full picture of foreign visitors who arrived on visas. A 2017 report by the Center for Migration Studies, however, gives a more current look at visa overstays. It shows McCarthy’s claim, while it should have been couched as an estimate rather than a statement of fact, is on the right track. It projects overstayers were 42 percent, or nearly half, of the country’s undocumented population in 2014. Finally, with the decline in illegal border crossings, it’s fair to estimate that visa overstayers now account for an increasing share of the country’s undocumented population. We rate McCarthy’s statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-08411	Says Texas voters are being asked to act this November on a proposed constitutional amendment affecting property taxes.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/oct/21/chain-email/chain-e-mail-says-voters-should-beware-texas-propo/	"TRUE OR FALSE?" a reader wrote us Oct. 7, though he wasn't talking about a candidate's pronouncement. Instead, the reader was forwarding an e-mail titled "State Propositions on Ballot to Tax Homesteads / November." It warns that there are three propositions on the November ballot "allowing the state of Texas to start taxing residential homeowners. So if you own a home, and these laws are passed, you will be taxed by the state." The e-mail goes on: "I received a flyer from the (Texas) Secretary of State, Hope Andrade, listing the propositions that are up for election. I called to question them before sending this message out to my homeowner friends." Whoa, Nellie. Stop the presses. We are certain that there are no propositions on the statewide ballot Nov. 2. We figure too that Andrade, the state's chief elections officer, knows this and would have told a caller so. Still, it's our duty at PolitiFact Texas to check stuff out. So we left Andrade a message and began our research. Our first find: The Longview News-Journal had beat us to it. In an Oct. 14 news article, the newspaper found the same e-mail misleading. "This is a good example of why we should approach the random e-mails that make it to our in boxes with a big question mark," the newspaper reminded readers. "There are no statewide propositions on the Nov. 2 ballot. Texas voted on these propositions in 2009, and that's why the date in this e-mail was wrong if you're living in 2010." Oh, right. On Nov. 3, 2009, Texas voters approved 11 proposed constitutional amendments including Propositions 1, 2 and 3. Proposition 1 related to tax increment financing by cities and counties, Proposition 2 permitted state lawmakers to tie property taxes on a residence homestead solely to the property's value as a homestead and Proposition 3 provided for uniform standards and procedures for the appraisal of property for property tax purposes, according to summaries placed online by the secretary of state's office. As the Longview newspaper noted, the propositions "did not create state property taxes as the e-mail claimed." The newspaper quotes Randall Dillard, Andrade's spokesman, saying that the same e-mail circulated before the 2009 election, and it's apparently still making the rounds. "It was inaccurate in 2009," Dillard said, "and it's inaccurate for the November 2010 election as well." Four days after the Longview article was published, Andrade posted a press release online stating there are no statewide propositions on the 2010 ballot. If voters want to check into anything on the ballot, the state recommends an online visit to www.votexas.org or a telephone call to the secretary of state at 1-800-252-8683. Finally, we went back to the chain e-mail and noticed a clear clue that it's out of date; it provides a web link to an inactive web page about the 2009 elections. Pants on Fire!

pomt-09830	"Medicare has at least $80 billion worth of fraud a year. That's a full 20 percent of every dollar that's spent on Medicare goes to fraud."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/27/tom-coburn/coburn-says-20-percent-every-medicare-dollar-goes-/	On the Aug. 24 edition of Fox News Channel's On the Record With Greta Van Susteren , Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. — an ob-gyn who has taken a leading position against Democratic health care reform efforts — took aim at Medicare fraud. The senator said, "If you look at Medicare and Medicaid, both vital programs today, they're highly inefficient. People claim that they're efficient. Medicare has at least $80 billion worth of fraud a year. That's a full 20 percent of every dollar that's spent on Medicare goes to fraud. And Medicaid is not much better. We don't actually have the numbers because half the states aren't reporting their Medicaid fraud. So when you have programs that are designed to be defrauded, even though they're well-intended and they are helping people, we ought to think about how do we get better value for that money and less money going out the door. " In this item, we'll focus on Coburn's estimate that there is $80 billion in Medicare fraud annually. After speaking to health care experts and searching on the Internet, we found that while Medicare fraud is a notable concern, statistics offered to document the scale of the problem are slippery at best. On May 6, 2009, Daniel Levinson, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, testified before the Senate Special Committee on Aging that "it is not possible to measure precisely the extent of fraud in Medicare and Medicaid." As a result, estimates of fraud in the system vary — widely. The number Levinson offered lawmakers is one from the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association. Levinson said that the NHCAA — whose members include private insurance companies and government agencies — estimated that "at least 3 percent — or more than $60 billion each year — is lost to fraud." But as Levinson was careful to note, the $60 billion figure covers fraud in all U.S. health care expenditures — not just in Medicare, which would mean that Coburn is way off in his estimate. But before drawing any conclusions, we turned to the NHCAA for more background on that figure, which is, to be exact, $68 billion. Louis Saccoccio, the NHCAA's executive director, told PolitiFact that the 3 percent estimate is calculated from the experiences of the private insurers who belong to his group. But he emphasized that it is indeed an estimate, and a conservative one at that. "No one has a hard number," he said, "because you can't go out with a survey and ask, 'How much are you robbing from Medicare?'" Another prominent figure in the field, Malcolm Sparrow, argues that estimates in the range of 3 percent are low — "ridiculously low," he put it in an interview. Sparrow, a onetime fraud investigator and detective chief inspector with the British police service, is now a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Sparrow agrees with Saccoccio that no one has put together an accurate accounting of Medicare fraud. But he argues that the kind of errors detected by current control systems are primarily technical glitches — not the products of criminal minds setting out to defraud the system. And given that Medicare offers a large pot of money, a high degree of automation in its claims-paying process and limited auditing capabilities, he argues, the program is a godsend for dedicated con artists. "Criminals, who are intent on stealing as much as they can and as fast as possible, and who are prepared to fabricate diagnoses, treatments, even entire medical episodes, have a relatively easy time breaking through all the industry's defenses," Sparrow testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs on May 20, 2009. "The criminals' advantage is that they are willing to lie. And provided they learn to submit their bills correctly, they remain free to lie. The rule for criminals is simple: If you want to steal from Medicare, or Medicaid, or any other health care insurance program, learn to bill your lies correctly. Then, for the most part, your claims will be paid in full and on time, without a hiccup, by a computer, and with no human involvement at all." His evidence is anecdotal but suggestive. In a recent academic paper, Sparrow noted that then-FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in 1995 that cocaine traffickers in Florida and California were switching from drug dealing to health care fraud because they discovered that health care fraud was safer, easier and more lucrative than the drug trade, and that it carried a smaller risk of detection. In 1997, Sparrow added, the New York Times reported that organized crime families in New York City and New Jersey were abandoning extortion and bid-rigging in favor of new criminal enterprises such as health insurance fraud. Usually, he writes, major frauds are uncovered by whistleblowers rather than audit systems. One example is the case of Columbia HCA, a major hospital chain that in 2003 agreed to a $1.7 billion settlement with the Justice Department after 10 years of investigations initiated by whistleblower allegations. Sparrow also points to suits under the federal False Claims Act as evidence of a major fraud problem in the health care sector. The False Claims Act allows citizens to allege the existence of defrauding the government and then reap a share of the government's savings once the improprieties are rooted out. False Claims Act suits against HHS now account for a large majority of all such suits filed annually. "There is apparently no other area of federal spending so vulnerable to fraud, and so deeply infected," Sparrow writes. Sparrow testified that because HHS audit procedures do not dig very deep, "we now have no reliable indications of the overall fraud loss rates for the Medicare program." (A spokeswoman for the HHS Inspector General's Office declined to comment on Sparrow's analysis.) Now, back to Coburn's assertion. When we called his office, his staff told us that his source for the comment was an article in the National Review , a conservative magazine. The July 15, 2009, article said of Sparrow, "He thinks that as much as 20 percent of the federal health care budget is consumed by fraud, which would be $85 billion a year for Medicare." That's pretty close to what Coburn said on Van Susteren's show. But is the senator right? It depends on whether you trust NHCAA or Sparrow. Total Medicare outlays were $431 billion in 2007, or 19 percent of total national health care expenditures. If one assumes that fraud is equally prevalent in Medicare and other types of health care, that would make the Medicare share of the NHCAA's $68 billion fraud estimate $13 billion. And $13 billion in fraud divided by $431 billion in total Medicare outlays would be 3 percent of total Medicare expenditures — a far cry from Coburn's 20 percent. (A rate of 20 percent is "possible, but I don't think it's very plausible," Saccoccio said.) Skeptical that Medicare is only being defrauded at rates equal to the private sector? Let's triple that number to $39 billion in fraud. If you do that, it still comes out to 9 percent — less than half of what Coburn asserted it was. In the meantime, Coburn's dollar figure — $80 billion in fraud — would be no more accurate if the NHCAA is right. The group says there's $68 billion in fraud in all health care expenditures — but Coburn's figure for Medicare alone is bigger than that. However, by Sparrow's analysis, Coburn could indeed be in the ballpark. In an interview, Sparrow himself said the Coburn estimate is "perfectly plausible." He added that Coburn "doesn't know any more than you or I do." Because of the uncertainty about how much Medicare fraud actually exists, we think Coburn oversteps when he states definitively that "Medicare has at least $80 billion worth of fraud a year." Not only is there a statistical disagreement over how big the problem currently is, but all the key players also agree that there are simply no good data to rely on. Still, because Coburn's estimate is considered plausible by a leading academic in the field, we can't dismiss it as undeniably false. We rate Coburn's statement Half True.

pomt-03593	"70,000 three-year-olds and four-year-olds across America will lose access to the preschool Head Start program. ... 2,000 in the state of Florida alone."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/may/13/kathy-castor/kathy-castor-says-70000-children-will-lose-access-/	Faced with complaints about airport delays, members of Congress (who happen to be frequent fliers) took action to halt sequester-related furloughs for air traffic controllers. Some Democrats want to know why other groups aren’t getting similar relief from the sequester. U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, railed against cuts to Head Start on MSNBC’s Hardball. Host Chris Matthews said Head Start "faces a $406 million cut, which would kick 70,000 kids out of the program." Castor responded: "70,000 three-year-olds and four-year-olds across America will lose access to the preschool Head Start classroom. Now Head Start is intended for students who don’t have every advantage in life to ensure that they are ready for elementary school. It’s also important because it ensures that their parents are ready to work. (That’s) 70,000 students across America and 2,000 in the state of Florida alone because the Republicans refuse to replace the sequester or sit down with us to negotiate a balanced plan." Castor only mentioned Head Start and provided specific numbers. Two months into the sequester, we wondered what evidence supports the claim that 70,000 preschoolers will lose access to Head Start. We were especially interested whether it would be 2,000 in Florida. Head Start sequester Head Start is an early education program that aims to increase kids’ "school readiness" with whole or half-day programs. Head Start serves more than 1 million kids a year. The program offers contracts to local providers, so sometimes multiple groups will offer Head Start programs, even within a single county. That's why claims about the program are estimates, because decisions about how many children to enroll are made on the local level. Before the sequester, Head Start enrollment was at record highs because the Obama administration nearly doubled the number of children enrolled in Early Head Start through the economic stimulus, leading to a dramatic rise between 2009 and 2010. Congress decided to spend more money on Head Start in the next two years to keep enrollment at that level. A month before the sequester took effect, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote in a Feb. 1 letter that "up to 70,000 children" would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start. The White House released estimates that stated Head Start would be eliminated for 2,700 Florida children. (Castor's office pointed us to federal estimates as evidence for her claim.) The 70,000 estimate hasn’t changed, HHS spokesman Ted Froats told PolitiFact Florida. The agency came up with the number through a formula based on appropriations, past levels of children served and the cost to serve a child. The number is not based on responses from programs about how they will handle the cut -- or have already. The federal Office of Head Start is collecting information on how programs are handling the cuts and expects to have that data in June. "We do know that many programs have closed services early for this year and others have begun reducing the number of children served," Froats said in an email. Programs were notified of their 5.27 percent budget cut in late April, and many are still determining how to implement the cut, according to the National Head Start Association. (For months they had been expecting around a 5 percent cut.) We read multiple media reports about Head Start; many stories reference predictions of lost spots, repeating the federal government’s pre-sequester estimates. Some programs found ways to maintain enrollment, such as by reducing teacher in-service days. The New York Times cited a few examples of the various impacts: In Colorado Springs, children decorated chairs to sell at $500 apiece; so far the fundraiser had saved two seats. Meanwhile a Head Start program in the Maine community of Pejepscot is being closed, as are programs in two Texas towns. We should explain that losing "access" can also mean anywhere from closing one day a month to switching from a full year program to nine months. Many programs are offering spots to fewer new children next school year. We checked in with some Head Start programs around the state of Florida. Here’s what we found: • Broward County: The program run through the Broward school district will not reduce enrollment. Broward plans to cut nine staff positions -- mostly retirements, plus two will get laid off -- and shorten Early Head start from 11 months a year to 10 months to achieve cuts of about $1 million. About 2,100 children attend the programs. Matching funds from the school district are helping Broward avoid cutting services to children. "We are not cutting any seats," said Broward head start coordinator Claudia Dean. • Miami-Dade County: More than 7,000 students are served by the program. County Mayor Carlos Gimenez’ proposed fiscal year 2013-14 budget includes an additional $2.9 million for Head Start to offset the federal reduction. The investment will allow the county to maintain the number of children served by the program. • Hillsborough County: The Hillsborough County School District, the county’s largest Head Start provider, has so far avoided cutting spots by holding off on building two covered play areas and canceling field trips. But it will reduce the number of children it serves by 40 in its next budget, district spokesman Steve Hegarty told PolitiFact Florida. "That will require five fewer staffers," he said. The district will lose $551,000 from sequestration in its current budget, and it expects to lose more in the new one that begins in October. The county, which oversees the federal grant, dealt with budget cuts by cutting vacant positions and training, said Maria Mason, deputy director of program operations for the county's Head Start/Early Head Start program. The county is still assessing how a $1.4 million cut will affect its 2013-14 budget, but Mason is certain it will result in fewer slots for kids and lotteries to determine who gets access. "We don't have any true numbers at this point," she said. Lutheran Services Florida also works as a subcontractor for Hillsborough County’s Early Head Start program. It serves 120 kids but will eliminate eight spots next year. • Hernando, Sumter and Volusia counties: The staff agreed to forgo contributions to retirement accounts, eliminate staff training and reduce cleaning services to avoid reducing services this year, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Next year, the number of children accepted will drop by about 50. One program in Seville will close two weeks early, according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. • Palm Beach County: The Head Start program in Belle Glade, a city within Palm Beach County, plans to cut up to 30 spots for the 2013-14 year, according to David Yarborough, a vice president for Lutheran Services Florida. The Palm Beach Post reported that bus service would end for hundreds of children in Head Start in Palm Beach. • Pinellas County: Lutheran Services Florida will soon take over Pinellas County’s Head Start grant, but Yarborough said he didn’t yet know how it will handle the cuts there. Our ruling Castor said, "70,000 three-year-olds and four-year-olds across America will lose access to the preschool Head Start program. … 2,000 in the state of Florida alone." Castor omitted that important qualifier "up to" 70,000 children that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provided in February. Her Florida figure comes from the White House (2,700 for Florida) and the National Head Start Association (2,000). HHS hopes to provide data in June that will show how many spots for Head Start are actually being cut based on reporting by the programs. Until federal officials share that data, it is difficult to come up with an accurate nationwide number based on anecdotal evidence in news articles. Also, Castor used a vague term by saying the children will lose "access." Access could mean a number of things, from scaling back weeks of operation, removing bus service, or cutting enrolled kids. News reports show many programs are finding ways to completely avoid or at least reduce the number of affected children by cutting other parts of the program, such as staff retirement funds and cleaning services, and holding fundraisers.

pomt-00368	"When two judges said it was illegal to fire a teacher" who viewed pornography at school, "Tony Evers worked with Republicans and Democrats and changed the law."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/12/stronger-wisconsin/group-defending-governor-candidate-tony-evers-hand/	After the Wisconsin Republican Party repeatedly attacked Tony Evers with TV ads over his role in a teacher porn case, two groups defended the Democratic candidate for governor with their own TV ads, both released on Aug. 20, 2018. The ad by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee was partially accurate. But it overstated in describing why Evers, the state schools superintendent, didn’t revoke the teacher’s license and what he did to make a change in state law. We rated the group’s two-part claim as Half True. Now we’re evaluating the other ad, by a group called A Stronger Wisconsin, which is backed by the Democratic Governors Association. This ad also makes a two-part claim and, while partially accurate, it also has some overstatement problems. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The case The ad is about the case of Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. He was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he should have been given a suspension rather than be fired because other employees were given lesser punishments for "doing the same or similar types of things." The arbitrator also determined that Harris’ behavior, given that students were not present when he viewed the images, did not endanger any students as defined by state law at the time. The law at the time was crucial in Evers’ decision not to try to revoke Harris’ license after the arbitrator gave Harris his job back. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. The ad The TV spot by A Stronger Wisconsin begins with images and criticism of Republican Gov. Scott Walker, whom Evers will face in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election. Then the narrator says: "When two judges said it was illegal to fire a teacher for inappropriate conduct, Tony Evers worked with Republicans and Democrats and changed the law." However, words on the screen went further on that second part, declaring: "Evers got the law changed." So, let’s look at both parts of the claim. State GOP: Says Tony Evers "allowed a middle-school teacher found guilty of spreading pornographic material at school to keep teaching students." Mostly False. ‘Two judges said it was illegal’ The first part of the claim, as stated by the narrator and shown on the screen, is "two judges said it was illegal" to fire the teacher. A footnote on the screen cites one of our fact checks. Two courts did uphold the arbitrator’s decision to overturn the firing. But the ad’s phrasing overstates what the judges found and it isn’t what we said. A circuit court judge, and a three-judge state appeals court panel, upheld the arbitrator's ruling to give Harris his job back — concluding the arbitrator was within her rights to do so. But they didn’t conclude that firing the teacher was illegal. State GOP: Says Tony Evers "didn't revoke the license of a teacher caught spreading pornography and commenting on the bodies of middle-school girls." Half True. Evers ‘worked with’ or ‘got the law changed’? The Harris case led to a change in state law so that now, the law explicitly says that if a teacher views pornography at school, even if students aren’t present, the teacher can be fired. The ad, meanwhile, gives mixed messages on the new law. The narrator says Evers "worked with" lawmakers and changed the law, but the words on the screen say "Evers got the law changed." A group of Republicans introduced the bill and the author of the bill downplayed the role of Evers’ department. But officials in Evers’ department discussed the legislation with the author as the bill was being drafted and testified at hearings in favor of it. So, Evers was involved — as the narrator says in the ad — but was not the leading force, as the words on the screen claim. Our rating A Stronger Wisconsin says: "When two judges said it was illegal to fire a teacher" who viewed pornography at school, "Tony Evers worked with Republicans and Democrats and changed the law." Judges ruled that an arbitrator was within her rights to overturn the firing, but they did not conclude that the firing was illegal. Meanwhile, Evers supported the change in state law, but was not the leading force. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

pomt-07976	Says 2010 was the "worst year ever for America's doctors" reimbursed by Medicare.	false	/texas/statements/2011/jan/20/michael-burgess/michael-burgess-says-2010-was-worst-year-ever-doct/	A Texas doctor in the U.S. House, Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, closed out 2010 by telling a Fox Business Network interviewer that the year was awful for physicians participating in Medicare, the federal program that helps cover medical costs for the elderly. "This is the worst year ever for America’s doctors who are reimbursed under the Medicare system," Burgess said Dec. 28. "2010 will go down as a year in infamy. It may have gotten a little bit better right at the end of the year, but it’s ... a system that itself is on life support." In an interview, Burgess told us his gloomy take reflects delays by Congress last year in stopping a formula-driven reduction in what Medicare pays physicians, fueling uncertainty among doctors counting on the payments to stay level. He said improvement came late in 2010 when Congress extended a 2.1 percent rate increase through 2011. Some background: In 1997, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Congress voted to tie Medicare physician payments to a complex formula based on the number of Medicare beneficiaries, the overall growth in the economy, changes in law or regulation affecting the utilization of services and a special factor – the Medicare Economic Index – that reflects the rate of inflation in physicians’ costs. Spokeswoman Ellen Griffith said via e-mail that if the annual rate of growth in Medicare spending for physician services is greater than the target, then payment rates must be cut. And, she said, only Congress can override the cut or change the formula. Under the formula, Medicare rates went up from 1998 through 2001, but went down about 5 percent in 2002. From 2003 through 2005, Griffith said, Congress intervened to stop or reverse formula-driven rate cuts. In 2006 and 2007, Congress froze physician rates at the 2005 level. In 2008, Congress overrode the formula-driven cut to approve a .5 percent increase, later voting to increase rates by 1.1 percent for 2009, she said. In June 2010, the Texas Medical Association characterized the rates as"stagnant" for the past decade while the cost of running a medical practice increased 28 percent. Meanwhile, some doctors have fled the Medicare program. According to a May 17, 2010 Houston Chronicle news article, more than 300 Texas doctors ended their involvement with Medicare in the previous two years, including 50 in the first three months of 2010. Before 2007, only a handful (for instance, seven in 2006) annually opted out, the newspaper said. In 2007, 70 doctors notified Trailblazer Health Enterprises, the state's Medicare carrier, they would no longer participate. The number was 151 in 2008, 135 in 2009 and was on pace to reach 200 in 2010, the newspaper said. Hold the stethoscope. So Medicare rates actually went down in 2002 and stayed flat from 2005 through 2007 -- yet Burgess ranks 2010, when rates eventually rose, as the worst year ever for doctors. How come? Burgess told us his assessment has to do with how Congress dealt with the issue last year -- in fits and starts. According to a timeline compiled by the medical association, Congress voted March 3, 2010 to delay a 21 percent rate cut to April 1. While the cut was then supposed to take effect, the centers instead stopped processing physician claims to carve time for Congress to intervene, Griffith said. On April 15, Congress stepped in, delaying the 21 percent cut until June. In June, the cut took effect, meaning some reduced-rate payments went out, though Griffith said those were reprocessed after Congress in late June put a 2.2 percent rate increase in effect through November, retroactive to June 1. Before the end of the year, Congress delayed the formula-driven rate twice more, finally voting to extend the 2 percent increase through 2011. Burgess told us the pauses in Medicare payments made things difficult for doctors who were counting on them: "The electric company is not going to say we understand, pay that light bill when you get around to it. Your nurse doesn’t come in one morning saying you don’t need to pay me this week. Drug companies... still send the bills, your fixed costs still run. So where is the only place that you give in a small doctor’s office? The doctor doesn’t get a paycheck that month... That is what no one in Congress understands. When we jack around with this stuff, we are hurting people on the front lines who are taking care of patients." Steve Levine, spokesman for the Texas Medical Association, said Congress created "a formula that is not viable in terms of covering the costs of providing care to people on Medicare. Both parties are to blame. Leaders and at-large leaders of both parties have told medicine year after year after year, we feel your pain and want to fix it. Both parties have had opportunities to do so and have not." On whether 2010 was "the worst year ever," Levine said "most Texas physicians would say the constant threat of a 20 (to) 25 percent cut was what made this year so exasperating." He added later by e-mail: "The constant uncertainty over a much, much larger cut combined with five weeks of held payments made it bad, very bad. What we're talking about here is physicians' perceptions, which can't be measured as objectively as you're trying to do." Our finding: Hitches in congressional action on an anticipated big cut in Medicare rates surely contributed to physicians’ financial worries in 2010. However, their rates increased slightly at mid-year and the increase is scheduled to hold through this year. It’s difficult to see how that makes 2010 the worst year ever for Medicare doctors compared to 2002, when rates went down, and some subsequent years when rates were frozen.

pomt-01145	Says 3,000 Americans "died of gunfire" between the time of the Ebola scare in Dallas and the midterm elections.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/18/doonesbury/doonesbury-says-3000-died-guns-during-time-ebola-s/	A day before PolitiFact unveiled that exaggerations about Ebola took top honors as the 2014 Lie of the Year, the comic strip Doonesbury took aim at the very same target. The strip’s author Garry Trudeau imagined an interview between his characters NPR host Mark Slackmeyer, and Fox News correspondent Roland Hedley. Hedley: We’re very proud of our Ebola unit. We covered Obama’s bungling of the epidemic from the Dallas debacle to the election. Slackmeyer: Have any idea how many Americans died from Ebola during that time? Hedley: Um ... No. I’d have to run the numbers on that. Slackmeyer: None. Not a single one. Want to know how many died of gunfire during that same period? Hedley: I don’t see how that’s relevant. Slackmeyer: Statistically, about 3,000. For the record, Trudeau is correct about the number of Americans who died from Ebola. The two people who succumbed on American soil were not American citizens. But we wanted to take a closer look at Trudeau’s statement that "statistically, about 3,000" people died of gunfire between the events in Dallas and the November election. That word "statistically" struck us as a particularly careful choice. To refresh your memory, Thomas Eric Duncan was admitted to a Dallas hospital on Sept. 28. Duncan ultimately died and then two nurses who treated him contracted the disease. They both survived. The election took place on Nov. 4. Trudeau explained to us that he based his number on annual deaths due to guns that he found on a website run by the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney in Australia. The yearly totals only went through 2011 so Trudeau looked back five years and took the lowest number. He divided to find the weekly average and used that for the five weeks between Duncan becoming ill and the election. "It's obviously only a statistically typical five-week period," Trudeau said. "For all I know there could have been a major lull in gun violence in October. But for purposes of argumentative contrast, I felt it accurately reflected the magnitude of harm our epidemic of gun violence inflicts." Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s aptly named Wonder database, we found monthly numbers that ran through 2012. For simplicity, we summed deaths for October and the first four days of November. This approach was slightly more precise than Trudeau’s and as this table shows, it more than confirmed Trudeau’s claim. (Adding a few days in September would only make the case stronger.) Year October Nov. (4 days) Total 2012 2,733 364 3,097 2011 2,748 344 3,092 2010 2,725 336 3,061 2009 2,655 333 2,988 2008 2,626 339 2,965 Average 3,041 We don’t know exactly how many people died over that time period in 2014, and we won’t know for about a year. But Trudeau’s figure is very much in line with past trends, and as Trudeau noted to us, the numbers have been stable for many years. Suicide looms large The most important caveat to Trudeau’s statement is that it includes suicides. In 2012, the CDC classified 20,666 deaths as due to "intentional self-harm" by any sort of firearm. The number of deaths by assault, or what we might call homicide? 11,622. Gun violence is an umbrella term that covers all manner of deaths when a weapon is fired. It includes suicide, criminal homicide, police shootings, cases when the intent is unknown, and a strange category called "exposure to inanimate mechanical force - firearm." When you hear about gun violence, it might suggest solely people killing each other. That would be inaccurate. Roughly two-thirds of the deaths are people killing themselves. Also, the CDC data records the death of residents, but it doesn’t track their citizenship status. Trudeau contrasted gun deaths with the deaths of Americans due to Ebola. We found no information that made the distinction. A note about Fox News While Fox News devoted many minutes if not hours to Ebola coverage, and not always with pinpoint accuracy, on Oct. 15 host Shepard Smith delivered a 4-minute monologue saying that fear of Ebola is "not based in fact or reason." Smith decried the tendency of politicians and news organizations to hype the hysteria. Our ruling Garry Trudeau, speaking through his characters in Doonesbury, said that in the time between the Ebola scare in Dallas and the election, "statistically" about 3,000 Americans died from gunfire. The latest data from the CDC bears that out. Using a five-year average, we found 3,041 deaths in the relevant time period. Given that the debate over gun deaths in this country often centers on homicides or accidental shootings, it is important to note that about two-thirds of the total would likely be suicides. Plus, the CDC data counts the deaths of residents, which might include some noncitizens. Still, the number of deaths is in line with what Trudeau said, even if the precise figures will vary. The claim is accurate but it requires some clarification. Accordingly, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Doonesbury	None	None	None	2014-12-18T10:47:59	2014-12-14	['Dallas', 'United_States']
pomt-05009	Mitt Romney "says the Arizona immigration law should be a model for the nation."	false	/texas/statements/2012/jul/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romney-calls-arizona-immigr/	At a San Antonio stop during his July 17, 2012, fundraising swing through Texas, President Barack Obama followed up a defense of the 2010 health-care overhaul by saying: "We’re not going backwards when it comes to immigration." Referring to Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Obama continued: "My opponent says the Arizona law should be ‘a model for the nation.’" Audience members booed. Obama then referred, without details, to his administration’s recent decision not to seek deportations of young, otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants. "I believe we can secure our borders and give opportunities to people who are striving and working hard -- especially young people who have been raised in this country and see themselves as Americans. That was the right thing to do. We're not going backwards; we're going forwards." We wondered if Obama journeyed backward by saying Romney called the Arizona immigration law a model for the nation -- which he also said later the same day at the Austin Music Hall. Noticeably, the president’s statement repeated a claim we checked before by U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-San Antonio. Gonzalez said in a March 27, 2012, conference call organized by the Democratic National Committee that while in Arizona, Romney had said he believes that the state’s much-debated immigration-enforcement law — which originated in 2010 as Senate Bill 1070 — should be the template for federal immigration laws, a stance that Gonzalez described as disturbing. Gonzalez’s comment to reporters: "Gov. Romney has actually (said) — while he was in Arizona, of course, and I understand that he was basically maybe playing up to the Arizona crowd — he felt that SB 1070, which has made its way up to the Supreme Court of the United States and will be argued in April, he believes that it should be the template, it should be the model for United States immigration law, not comprehensive immigration reform as the more responsible individuals in Congress have been espousing for a number of years, but an extreme version of an anti-immigrant law passed by the Arizona Legislature." After Gonzalez made that statement, the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012 threw out parts of the Arizona law that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations including provisions requiring immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers, making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants, as reported by The Associated Press. However, the court let stand a "show me your papers" requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. And they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges. According to the AP, Romney did not immediately comment on the decision, though he said he believes that "each state has the duty — and the right — to secure our borders and preserve the rule of law, particularly when the federal government has failed to meet its responsibilities." Now back to whether Romney referred to the Arizona law as a model. In our check of Gonzalez, DNC spokesman Ricardo Ramirez pointed us to an answer Romney gave during the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Arizona. We found that Romney did not say in the debate that Arizona's 2010 law should be adopted by Congress in lieu of comprehensive immigration reform; his reply to a question focused instead on a different, older Arizona statute. That said, we see how his reply could be misread. As John King of CNN framed his question to Romney, crowd members applauded mention of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona’s Maricopa County, shown in attendance, who is known for his advocacy of tough immigration policies. Then King said to Romney: "You've talked, governor, about self-deportation, if businesses do their job, asking for the right documents, the people will leave. But what about arresting? Should there be aggressive, seek them out, find them and arrest them as Sheriff Arpaio advocates?" "You know, I think you see a model here in Arizona," Romney answered. "They passed a law here that says, that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on E-Verify. This E-Verify system allows employers in Arizona to know who's here legally and who's not here legally. And as a result of E-Verify being put in place, the number of people in Arizona that are here illegally has dropped by some 14 percent, where the national average has only gone down 7 percent." E-Verify is a federal, Internet-based system that employers can use to verify whether someone is authorized to work in the United States. Participation is voluntary for most U.S. businesses; there is no federal mandate. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s website says that more than 280,000 employers across the country are using the system. After the Arizona debate, many reporters, opinion columnists, Democrats and liberal groups interpreted that statement by Romney as him saying that SB 1070 as a whole should be a model, either for the nation or for other states. However, Dan Nowicki, the Arizona Republic’s national political reporter, questioned those interpretations in a March 3, 2012, news article, pointing out that Arizona’s requirement that businesses use E-Verify is not contained in SB 1070 but in an earlier state law, the Legal Arizona Workers Act. "It's clear from the (debate) transcript that Romney was describing part of the state's 2007 employer-sanctions law, which has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court," Nowicki wrote. "That Arizona law requires employers to use a federal electronic system to verify whether new hires are eligible to work in the United States and provides punishment for companies that hire undocumented immigrants." According to Nowicki’s article, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams told the Republic that in the Arizona debate, Romney was referring to the E-Verify requirement as the model and not SB 1070. Williams reiterated that statement to us in an email. Ramirez, of the DNC, also pointed to the rest of Romney’s debate response in the Feb. 22 debate as backup for Gonzalez’s claim. The remainder of Romney’s answer: "So going back to the question that was asked, the right course for America is to drop these lawsuits against Arizona and other states that are trying to do the job Barack Obama isn't doing. And I will drop those lawsuits on day one. I'll also complete the fence. I'll make sure we have enough Border Patrol agents to secure the fence. And I will make sure we have an E-Verify system and require employers to check the documents of workers, and to check E-Verify. And if an employer hires someone that has not gone through E- Verify, they're going to get sanctioned just like they do for not paying their taxes. You do that, and just as Arizona is finding out, you can stop illegal immigration. It's time we finally did it." So, Romney in the debate saluted the E-Verify element of a 5-year-old Arizona law — which was not part of the 2010 immigration-enforcement law that Gonzalez says Romney called a model for the nation. Then again, Romney also said he would end the federal challenge to the 2010 law on his first day as president. Obama’s campaign, asked to back up his San Antonio claim, emailed a statement describing Romney as extreme on immigration issues. The statement did not show that Romney considers the Arizona law a model for the nation. Our ruling Obama could legitimately have targeted Romney’s vow to immediately drop the federal challenge to Arizona’s immigration-enforcement law as president. Instead, the Democrat’s statement mischaracterizes Romney’s salute to Arizona’s 2007 mandate that employers electronically verify the legal status of employees. That E-Verify requirement was not in the 2010 Arizona law. We rate Obama’s claim as False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-07-17T18:47:17	2012-07-17	['Arizona', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-04837	"Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns."	false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/14/debbie-wasserman-schultz/major-candidates-modern-times-have-release-12-year/	Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz went on Fox News Aug. 12 to criticize Mitt Romney’s vice presidential pick, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. At one point, she turned the conversation to Romney’s tax returns. Here’s some of the back and forth between the South Florida congresswoman and Fox News Sunday guest host John Roberts: Wasserman Schultz: "Barack Obama and Joe Biden have released 12 years of tax returns. Mitt Romney has released one and a partial view of a second one. His own father..." Roberts: "John McCain released two." Wasserman Schultz:: "His own father -- no, John McCain released more than -- released about 12 years of tax returns." Roberts: "John Kerry didn't release his wife's tax returns. I mean, you can make a lot of arguments what is appropriate in terms of..." Wasserman Schultz: "Spouses are not running for president. ... Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns. It's unacceptable." The subject of Romney’s tax returns and his taxes has generated multiple claims we’ve evaluated on our Truth-O-Meter. Here, we will examine Wasserman Schultz’s claim, "Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns." PolitiFact recently examined a claim by former President Bill Clinton that it’s typical for presidential candidates to release 10 or 11 years of tax returns. We rated that claim Half True, and we will draw from that fact-check. There have been several major presidential candidates to release fewer than 12 tax returns: • In 2000, George W. Bush provided nine and Al Gore eight. • In the 2008 primary, then Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., delivered seven, a move that was matched by Hillary Clinton about a month later. • In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis released six years of returns. • In 2008, McCain released two years of returns, as Roberts said. • In 1980, Ronald Reagan offered up just one return. There is a difference for incumbents and challengers. Ever since 1976, when Jimmy Carter became president, sitting presidents and vice presidents have released their taxes each year they are in office. By the time re-election rolls around, they have put at least four tax returns into the public record. Challengers generally match or exceed that. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org looked at this in July and found that since 1980, only two general election candidates have revealed no more than two years of tax returns. One was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in 2008 and the other is Romney, who released his 2010 tax return and an estimate of 2011. When we contacted the DNC about this fact-check, they sent us a statement saying Romney should release more of his tax returns. What they didn’t provide was evidence to support Wasserman Schultz’s claim. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, "Mitt Romney is the first major party candidate for president of the United States in modern times not to release at least 12 years of tax returns." There are several examples of major party candidates for president in modern times who released fewer than 12 tax returns. And those examples have been highlighted in recent news articles. Wasserman Schultz’s claim is not correct, and we rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b2415e9e-2c2b-402f-8451-cf2041d0e8c8	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2012-08-14T11:00:48	2012-08-12	['United_States']

However, MBIE’s National Construction Pipeline Report for 2017 estimated that residential consents will steadily grow from 30,453 homes to a peak of 34,500 homes per year in 2019. If that is the case, then it is likely around 200,000 homes will be consented over the next six years, from 2017-2023. It is probable Mr English is anticipating the rate to increase in accordance with heightened demand for housing, as New Zealand’s population is expected to grow to 5.01 – 5.51 million in 2025. If New Zealand achieves its highest ever recorded rate of consents of 40,000 homes per year in early 1974, it will go far beyond this 200,000 houses goal. One important caveat: just because a house is consented, does not meant the house gets constructed. Experimental statistics published by Statistics NZ earlier this year concluded that 97 percent of house consented do eventually get built, within 10 months on average. However, over the past year Auckland Council has been developing a database of dwelling completions - the only local authority to do so. The latest monthly data puts the annual completion rate at 6,827 - despite an annual consent rate of about 10,000 houses.

pomt-07942	The federal government "may put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/26/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-repeats-claim-health-care-bill-wi/	In her Tea Party Express-sponsored rebuttal to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., repeated a line used by numerous other Republican opponents of the Democratic-backed health care law passed in 2010. "Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which light bulbs to buy and which may put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill." We’ve previously looked at the light bulb comment and have done so again. Here we’ll scrutinize Bachmann’s claim about the IRS. We looked at this question when then-Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., (now a senator) said in a March 21, 2010, House floor speech, "About the only jobs created by the (health care) legislation would be at the IRS. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the IRS would need to hire over 16,000 people -- over 700 just in Illinois-- to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates of the bill." Let’s note right off the bat that Kirk added a few problematic details that Bachmann did not, specifically his decision to cite the CBO, the nonpartisan budget arm of Congress, as his primary source. So we’ll rate Bachmann’s statement on its own terms. On Dec. 19, 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill, which ultimately became the basis for the bill that was passed by both chambers and signed into law. The CBO wrote that it had "not completed an estimate of the discretionary costs that would be associated with the legislation," including the costs for the IRS and other "federal agencies that would be responsible for implementing the provisions of the legislation." However, CBO did offer an estimate of the costs to the IRS for "implementing the eligibility determination, documentation, and verification processes for premium and cost-sharing credits." The IRS, the analysis said, "would probably" need to spend "between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years." However, CBO did not translate that dollar range into a possible number of new hires. Instead, that task was taken up by another group -- the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction for taxes. On March 18, 2010, the House Ways and Means Republicans released a report titled, "The Wrong Prescription: Democrats’ Health Overhaul Dangerously Expands IRS Authority." The report acknowledged that it is "impossible to know exactly how many new employees the IRS would have to hire to enforce the individual mandate and other provisions of the Democrats’ health care bill." Still, it uses IRS data and "reasonable assumptions about costs and program responsibilities" to suggest that as many as 16,500 additional "examiners, agents and other employees" could be needed. The Ways and Means Republicans used the high end of CBO's cost estimate of $10 billion over 10 years. "First, assume that the IRS budget would grow by the $10 billion that CBO indicates could be necessary. While there might be some early-year start-up costs to prepare for the added workload, most of the costs would accrue in the last six years of CBO’s ten-year budget window, when the individual mandate and other provisions, which present the bulk of the new enforcement responsibilities, take effect. Thus, for this analysis, assume that $1 billion total will be spent by the IRS in the first four years to prepare for the mandate with the spending increasing to $1.5 billion per year in each of the last six years. "Second, in the last year for which actual IRS data is available, fiscal year 2009, the IRS employed the equivalent of 92,577 people, nearly half of whom worked directly in examinations and collections. In total, the IRS had payroll and benefit expenses of $8.371 billion, implying that costs per worker were $90,427. If the $1.5 billion in annual funds are used for the payroll and benefits of a similar mix of employees, the IRS could add more than 16,500 additional agents, auditors, examiners, and administrative support personnel to enforce large portions of the nation’s health insurance system." But even as it offered the 16,500 figure, the Ways and Means Republicans' report offered caveats as well. "Some might argue that figure over-estimates the number of employees that would be hired, because it includes only payroll and benefit costs and does not include other costs that would be incurred, including office overhead," the report says. "However, note that the IRS total budget in fiscal year 2009 was $11.708 billion, meaning that, when all costs are included, IRS total spending averaged $126,474 per employee. Thus, critics of the 16,500 figure might argue that any new employees should be assumed to cost as much as the average member of the existing workforce and that the $1.5 billion per year would 'only' support hiring slightly more than 11,800 new IRS employees." In fact, in a footnote, the report said that "it is likely the number would lie somewhere in between the two sets of figures. There would be some additional overhead costs for the new employees, such as computers and telephone services. But there could also be fixed costs that are not as affected by additional workers (e.g., the agency may already have extra office space so does not need to rent additional square footage for each additional worker)." We contacted a half-dozen experts in federal human-resources issues to see if they could provide an independent critique of the report's math, but those who responded ultimately declined to either confirm or second-guess the Ways and Means Republicans' calculations, citing uncertainty about what kind of staffing would be needed. One key unknown is whether computer automation -- something in which the IRS has made a substantial investment in recent years -- could handle much of the work stemming from the health care bill, rather than employees. For the record, the IRS itself says that it has not sorted out the employment fallout yet. On March 25, 2010, IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman appeared at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight. At one point, Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., asked Shulman, "You said that right now you are moving forward as far as calculations and costs and staffing needs the IRS has -- you haven't made any of those final determinations yet, have you?" To that question, Shulman answered, "That's correct." Ultimately, we have several problems with 16,500 figure. • It uses the high end of the CBO estimate. The CBO estimated a cost burden of between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years. The Ways and Means Republicans' report made its calculations based only on the high end of that range. If it had used the $5 billion figure instead (or offered it side by side with the $10 billion figure) it would have worked out to 8,250 jobs. • The Ways and Means Republicans themselves acknowledge that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs. Factoring overhead -- rather than just salaries and benefits -- into the equation, the Republican staff said, would reduce the number from 16,500 new employees to 11,800. This isn't just an outside critique: this is something stated explicitly in the Ways and Means Republicans' own report. And if one uses the $5 billion CBO estimate rather than the $10 billion CBO estimate, that number could shrink to 5,900 new jobs -- substantially below the 16,500 figure. • The Ways and Means Republican staff is not a neutral arbiter. Republicans were, and are, strongly opposed to the Democratic-backed health care law. Earlier this month, every single Republican voted to repeal the law, joined by only a handful of Democrats. So we would be more comfortable relying on a figure by an independent, nonpartisan organization. All told, we do think it's fair to assume that the IRS will need to hire new employees, perhaps thousands, to handle the caseload from the new health care law. But even the Republican staffers who calculated the number acknowledged that 16,500 is the high end of a range that could theoretically stretch as low as 5,900 using their methodology. The good news for Bachmann is that she took greater care than Kirk did in phrasing the statistic. Rather than simply citing the 16,500 figure, she added some cushion by saying that the bill "may put 16,500 IRS agents" to work. That’s enough in our book to raise the rating from Barely True, which is what we gave Kirk, to Half True.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-01-26T15:25:28	2011-01-25	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-05199	As governor of Massachusetts, "Romney reduced unemployment to just 4.7 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/11/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-massachusetts-unemployment-hit-47/	In a new campaign ad, Mitt Romney doesn't mince words in boasting about the Massachusetts economy when he was governor. The ad -- which combines stirring music, footage of welders and forklift drivers and images of Romney gladhandling with factory employees -- was released June 8, 2012. "Romney," the ad says, "reduced unemployment to just 4.7 percent." We checked Bureau of Labor Statistics data and found that the statistic was correct. The low point for the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate during Romney’s tenure was 4.7 percent. (It happened during Romney’s final full month in office, December 2006.) But the number mirrored the larger national trend. And it's important to note, as we often do, that governors have limited impact on a state's economy. Both Massachusetts and the U.S. saw unemployment rates drop during Romney’s governorship. Unemployment declined during that period because the economy was recovering from a recession. If you take the numbers from January 2003 to January 2007 -- Romney’s first and last months in office -- you find a drop of 1.2 percentage points nationally (from 5.8 percent to 4.6 percent) and 1.0 points in Massachusetts (from 5.6 percent to 4.6 percent). That's not much of a difference. As for Romney's impact, economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small effect on a state's economy. Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state, warned us in June 2011 not to put to much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, said the policies of governors, presidents and mayors can affect job creation, but they play a small role in the overall picture. "Almost always," he said, "the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) In fact, the way the Romney campaign phrased the claim we’re checking is particularly bold. It doesn’t say that "under Romney, unemployment declined," or "due to Romney’s policies, unemployment declined," or "in Massachusetts, we reduced unemployment." The ad we're checking says simply that "Romney reduced unemployment," as if no other factors mattered. Our ruling The number is correct, but the ad oversteps in suggesting that Romney did this on his own. The employment situation in Massachusetts was subject to many factors, not just the governor’s policy. On balance, we rate the claim Half True. EDITOR'S NOTE: We have changed the headline for this story to remove any confusion about which statement we were rating. PolitiFact always rates the "ruling statement" -- the claim in large type at the very top of the article, usually a direct quote or paraphrase of a spoken or written statement -- not the headline.

pomt-06086	Says he "helped save" the Olympic games.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/06/mitt-romney/how-important-was-romney-fixing-troubled-salt-lake/	Mitt Romney portrays himself as an able manager as he campaigns for the Republican nomination for president. In addition to his tenure as governor of Massachusetts and two stints leading the buyout firm Bain Capital, he also has cited his role as chief executive officer of the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee in the run-up to the 2002 Winter Olympics. On the stump and in commercials, the Olympics are used to promote the image of Romney as a problem-solving turnaround specialist. In a campaign video titled "Leader," Romney says, "I worked at one company, Bain, for 25 years. And I left that to go off and help save the Olympic games." So, did Romney really "help save the Olympic games?" That's a broad claim. Was he successful at not just fixing the Salt Lake Olympics, but also saving the Olympic tradition? Romney left Bain in early 1999 to take over leadership of the games in the aftermath of a bribery scandal that ultimately exposed years of widespread corruption by members of the International Olympic Committee and their counterparts in host cities during the bidding process used to award the games. The initial focus in the late 1990s was on Salt Lake City, where the scandal forced several of the city’s Olympic officials to quit and the mayor to step down. It threatened to scare away corporate sponsors whose advertising dollars would be vital to helping to fund the games. An internal investigation pointed the finger at two key Olympic organizers who were among the officials who had been forced out, and the SLOC was reorganized. But with two years until the games were set to begin, officials needed someone who help restore credibility to the organization. Romney, a Mormon whose family has deep roots in the state and who attended Brigham Young University, was called in from Boston to clean up the mess. It was a pivotal moment for Romney, who had rejoined Bain after his failed 1994 bid to unseat Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. The Salt Lake assignment launched him into the national spotlight and helped reboot his political career. It also served as a springboard to his successful 2002 gubernatorial campaign. Next month will mark the 10th anniversary of the Salt Lake games, which turned a profit and were well-reviewed at the time. The Romney campaign points to that success as a prime example of his vaunted managerial acumen. Romney even wrote a book about it -- Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership and the Olympic Games. Many who worked closely with Romney in Salt Lake praise his Olympic work. One of them, Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor who tabbed Romney to lead SLOC, now campaigns for Romney. Mark Lewis worked for the International Olympic Committee when Romney hired him to help recruit additional corporations to help fund the games. SLOC’s effort to attract sponsors had come to a virtual standstill, Lewis said, with the bribery scandal and subsequent federal investigation casting a shadow over the organization. "Things were in pretty bad shape," Lewis said. "There was a significant budget deficit. There was also a crisis in confidence." Lewis, who now lives in Montana and is president of Jet Set Sports, which provides hospitality services at the Olympics for corporations, said he traveled with Romney to boardrooms and watched him make the pitch as to why the Salt Lake games were still a good bet. "It’s a pretty tough sell to go out to a company and say you should pay money to be associated with us," Lewis said. He said Romney’s sales job persuaded them to contribute. "I came into this not knowing Mitt," said Lewis, who is a state finance chairman for Romney in Montana. "I can tell you without hesitation he is one of the most amazing people I’ve ever worked with." Mark Tanner was the chief financial officer for the SLOC before Romney was hired. "The games weren’t in shambles, but they needed more money," said Tanner, who left for a corporate position shortly after Romney was brought in and now works for an educational nonprofit in San Diego. Even though the games had attracted a number of sponsors, many had fulfilled pledges through in-kind donations instead of money. "It was very straightforward that we needed more cash," Tanner said. "Mitt was a really quick study." History intervened as well. Just five months before the games came the 9/11 attacks, which changed attitudes in Washington about supporting the games financially. Tanner said winning federal backing had been a tough sell during his tenure. "That was money that was not available before," he said. Under Romney's leadership, the Olympic committee, which had about a $1.3 billion operating budget, ultimately brought in tens of millions in profits, enough to set aside $40 million to create a fund that owns and maintains the Olympic facilities that were built for the games. Not everyone is ready to declare Romney a gold medal winner for his Olympic performance. David Wallechinsky is an author and the vice president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. He said the Romney improved the situation in Salt Lake, but that the claim in the Romney ad, that he "helped save the Olympics" is too broad. The bribery scandal was a low point for the Olympic movement, Wallechinsky said, but it wasn’t an existential threat. "It wasn’t going to threaten the Olympic movement, which survived two world wars, major boycotts and terrorist attacks," Wallechinsky said. Our ruling While it may be stretch to suggest the future of Olympics themselves were at stake during Romney’s time in Salt Lake, by all accounts, he did help the city’s moribund Olympic committee reverse its fortunes after an embarrassing scandal and brought the 2002 Winter Olympics to a successful conclusion.

pomt-08954	Democrats in the 1930s wanted President Franklin Roosevelt "to be more conservative."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/22/george-will/george-will-says-democrats-1930s-wanted-fdr-be-mor/	During the July 18, 2010, roundtable segment of ABC's This Week, conservative columnist George Will turned to the 1930s in an effort to shed light on why Americans today are growing discouraged about the policies of a Democratic president. "The false liberal assumption is that economic hard times move the country to the left," Will said by way of introduction. "It's not true, and it didn't happen in the 1930s. Before the '36 election and after the '36 election, in which Roosevelt carried 46 of 48 states, Democrats said they wanted him to be more conservative, and only about 18 percent of Democrats said they wanted to increase spending. Those are Democrats." We weren't even aware that scientific public opinion polling existed in the 1930s, so we decided Will's claim that Democrats wanted Roosevelt to become more conservative was worth closer look. We started by asking Will's staff for a citation. They said that he took his numbers from 1930s-era Gallup polls cited in The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America, a 2004 book by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, journalists with The Economist. In turn, The Right Nation footnoted them to a 2003 book, The Strange Death of American Liberalism, by H.W. Brands. Researching in the main online archive for Gallup polls, we initially couldn't find the poll the books cited. But after conferring with Brands, we were able to locate it in an old bound volume. It was taken Nov. 29, 1936, and asked, "Should President Roosevelt's second administration be more liberal, more conservative, or about the same as his first?" Exactly 50 percent of Democratic respondents said "more conservative," while 19 percent said "more liberal" and 31 percent said "about the same." So "more conservative" is not an overwhelming majority, but it's easily in the lead among the three choices. But there's more to the story. To better understand the result, we turned to the largely forgotten world of 1930s polling. It turns out that Gallup began polling in 1935 using a method that's different from today's but fairly rigorous for its time. Today, reputable pollsters use random sampling to choose phone numbers from across the country which they then call to ask standardized, carefully worded questions. The assumption is that a truly random sample will reproduce the whole nation in microcosm to within a few percentage points of accuracy (that's the familiar "margin of error"). And while modern polling has its critics, most experts agree that it works pretty well. By contrast, the earliest polls by Gallup first determined the demographic makeup of the electorate, then assigned survey-takers to visit far-flung locales in order to personally interview respondents with certain demographic characteristics. The idea was that surveying a population that has the same statistical characteristics as the whole electorate would produce a good sense of the voting public's opinion. Polling experts we spoke to said that 1930s polling data has some value. But using it to prove a point requires caution, because 1930s polls are subject to certain types of statistical bias that today's polls have largely overcome. The most obvious difference is that Gallup's 1930s polling was more akin to today's "likely voter" samples, rather than today's broader "registered voter" samples. Since Gallup set out to reach a demographic sample that mirrored those who voted, its poll-takers did not direct their questions to individuals who were deemed unlikely to vote. There's nothing necessarily wrong with this approach -- "likely voter" polls are a valuable part of the political landscape today. But it should be noted whenever raw data from 1930s polls are used, because polling likely voters in that era underrepresented women, southerners, blacks and the less-educated, according to Adam J. Berinsky, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology political scientist, in a landmark 2006 paper on 1930s polls. Beyond sampling bias, there's another issue of concern: Was the poll Will cited representative of other Gallup polls taken around the same time? The answer is no. Eric Schickler, a political scientist at the University of California (Berkeley) tracked down a Gallup poll that was also taken in November 1936. One of the questions was, "Should President Roosevelt's second administration be more liberal, more conservative, or about the same?" Among the 1,378 Democrats interviewed, just over 50 percent -- a slender majority -- said "about the same," while 30 percent said "more conservative" and 19 percent said "more liberal." Meanwhile, Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, found two other examples that undercut Will's claim. Gallup asked the following question in successive polls during November 1937, a year after Roosevelt's reelection: "Do you think the policies of the Roosevelt Administration are too liberal, too conservative, or about right?" In the first poll, 70 percent of Democrats said "about right," 26 percent said "too liberal" and 4 percent said "too conservative." In the second poll, the numbers were similar, with "about right" rising to 74 percent. So, Democrats were once again likelier to say that FDR was too liberal than that he was too conservative, but both groups of respondents were far outnumbered by those who said FDR's approach was "about right." We'll grant that Will's introductory point -- that hard times in the 1930s didn't move the U.S. to the left -- has some merit. Several political scientists we talked to noted that public opinion tends to move in reaction to whoever the president is. "When a Republican is elected President, opinion shifts in a liberal direction, responding to real or perceived conservative changes in policy, and when a Democrat gets elected, opinion moves conservative," said Robert Y. Shapiro, a Columbia University political scientist. So when FDR came in, Gallup polling showed indications that respondents were concerned about leftward drift. So let's sum up. The book sources Will used did report the poll result accurately. But there are two problems. One is that Gallup polls at the time under-reported the views of many Americans. The other is that at least three Gallup polls from that era showed that 50 to 70 percent of Democrats thought FDR's approach was "about right," with much smaller proportions of Democrats seeking a more conservative FDR. So we rate Will's statement Half True.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2010-07-22T17:54:44	2010-07-18	['Franklin_D._Roosevelt', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-14853	Out of the total U.S. military budget, "significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to fight international terrorism."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/15/bernie-sanders/sanders-significantly-less-10-defense-dollars-go-f/	The Paris terror attacks put foreign policy front and center at the Democratic debate in Iowa. Each of the three candidates urged their own form of a robust response. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., underscored the need to rethink how the nation spends its counterterrorism dollars. "This nation is the most powerful military in the world," Sanders said. "We're spending over $600 billion a year on the military. And yet significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to fight international terrorism." We decided to explore that "less than 10 percent" figure. The Sanders campaign told us that Sanders was talking about the budget to fight the Islamic State group, otherwise known as ISIS or ISIL. "The president's request for the war on Islamic State group was just $5.3 billion for next year, or less than 10 percent of the war budget," spokesman Warren Gunnels said. But international terrorism is broader than the specific fight against ISIS. The Defense Department includes its operations in Afghanistan as part of the fight against terrorism. The 2015 Defense Department budget puts total spending at $560 billion, of which the Pentagon says about$60 billion went toward operations aimed at combatting terrorism. That’s nearly 11 percent of the military budget. Almost all of that money, about $55 billion, was spent in Afghanistan "with a focus on training, advising, and assisting the Afghan forces and carrying out counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al Qaeda in coordination with Afghan forces," as the Pentagon budget writers put it in their 2016 budget request. The remainder went toward fighting the Islamic State group, otherwise known as ISIS. We should note that the country spends billions more to fight terrorism, but those dollars show up outside the military budget. The FBI’s Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence Decision Unit spent about $3.3 billion in 2015. We don’t know how much was spent by the CIA and the National Security Agency. However, in 2013, documents leaked by NSA contractor Edward Snowden pointed to over $16 billion in spending to combat terrorism. If we add in those amounts, then the total rises to well above Sanders’ figure. However, his comparison was solely in the context of defense spending. Brian Finlay is the president of the Stimson Center, a defense policy group in Washington. Finlay told us that Sanders’ focus on the direct attacks unleashed on ISIS misses a great deal of the action. More subtle operations through the Defense and State departments "undercut the rationale for terrorism, erode their wherewithal to undertake operations, or otherwise prevent incidents from occurring," Finlay said. "This side of counterterrorism operations is every bit as important as the ‘bang bang’ response." Our ruling Sanders said that the country devotes "significantly less than 10 percent" of its military budget to fight international terrorism. A campaign spokesman told us that Sanders was only counting money spent against ISIS. However, according to the Defense Department budget, it spent a combined total of $60 billion on anti-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and in the battle with ISIS. This amounts to nearly 11 percent of total defense dollars, not significantly less as Sanders said. While you could argue that not all of the money going toward operations in Afghanistan is precisely aimed at counterterrorism, it is a great stretch to say that none of it should be counted. Sanders used an overly restricted definition that also ignores that a hefty amount of counterterrorism spending takes place outside of the Defense Department. We rate his statement Mostly False.

The Russians are second; Saudi Arabia is number three."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/17/george-allen/george-allen-says-us-leads-world-energy-resources/	George Allen says the United States has plenty of energy resources and that the president should allow more exploration and excavation of them. Allen, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat of retiring U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, said during a June 14 speech that America’s energy resources outpace those of any other nation. "We are number one in the world when it comes to energy resources," he said. "You would never know it. The Russians are second; Saudi Arabia is number three." When it comes to coal, oil and natural gas, are we really No. 1 here in the United States? Allen’s spokeswoman, Katie Wright, said the claim comes from a report by the Congressional Research Service, the non-partisan research arm of the legislative branch. The CRS study, and our own research, relied on the Energy Information Administration. The EIA, a unit of the Department of Energy, is a clearinghouse for information on energy production and consumption. The CRS report, released in 2009, converted the different types of fossil fuels into a "barrels of oil equivalent." Since each fuel produces a different amount of energy when burned, the conversion allows an "apples-to-apples" comparison. Natural gas reserves, for example, are reported per trillion cubic feet. About 5.64 trillion cubic feet of natural gas produce the same amount of energy as one billion barrels of oil. Coal reserves are reported in tons. One billion tons of coal produces as much energy as 3.45 billion barrels of oil. We used a 2010 version of the CRS report to get the latest figures. According to the CRS, the United States has the highest amount of proven fossil fuel reserves, the equivalent of 972.6 billion barrels of oil. Russia is second at the equivalent of 954.9 billion barrels of oil, followed by China with 474.8 billion barrels. Iran and Saudi Arabia are fourth and fifth, at 328.1 billion barrels and 309.1 billion barrels, respectively. The CRS also attempts to project the quantity of undiscovered reserves in each nation. If those are included, Saudi Arabia moves into third place because of its vast oil endowment. The United States and Russia retain the first two spots. Allen’s claim was based on the combination of proven and potential reserves. Uncle Sam is the undisputed king of coal, holding more than 27 percent of the world’s reserves. The United States ranked fourth in natural gas reserves, behind Russia, Iran and Qatar. We were a distant 11th when it comes to oil reserves, behind several Middle Eastern countries, Canada, Venezuela, Russia and Nigeria. When it comes to newer technologies like biofuels or wind power, there is little uniform data on global potential for those energy sources. Before we issue a ruling, there are a few caveats worth considering. A key issue is that world reserves of fossil fuels are always evolving. New fields are discovered, estimates for existing fields are altered, and resources are extracted or burned. Essentially, experts who estimate reserves are aiming at a moving target. And as former Energy Department official Alan Hegberg pointed out, some reserves may stay untapped in the current economic climate, given the cost or difficulty of extraction. But advances in technology or changes in weather could change the equation in the future. One example, he said, is the Arctic Ocean. "People think there is a ton of gas in the Arctic," he said. Arctic natural gas is now considered inaccessible, but a receding ice pack and longer summers could make those resources easier to reach. The next issue will be who owns the gas under the ice pack. Russia has tried to stake some claims, but Canada, the United States and Denmark -- which controls Greenland -- will also want a say. So where does the data leave us? Allen said the U.S. has the most plentiful energy resources in the world, followed by Russia and then Saudi Arabia. According to the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. has the largest proven reserve of fossil fuel resources, followed by Russia and China. If estimates of undiscovered oil and gas are included, the United States remains first, followed by Russia and Saudi Arabia. Data from the Energy Information Agency show that Russia has the largest volume of the three fossil fuels. But the American lead in coal, which produces very high amounts of energy when burned, means the United States narrowly edges Russia in the CRS report. Our only quibble with Allen is his decision to list Saudi Arabia third, since that ranking relies on undiscovered reserves. But that is a minor point. We rate the statement True.

pomt-07320	Says judges are using Shariah law in Dearborn, Mich.	false	/texas/statements/2011/may/14/leo-berman/state-rep-leo-berman-says-judges-dearborn-michigan/	This legislative session isn’t just about the budget; state Rep. Leo Berman has won House approval of a proposal that would prohibit courts from making legal decisions based on foreign laws, such as Shariah, the religious law of Islam. On May 9, House members attached Berman’s legislation as an amendment to House Bill 274, a tort reform measure that Gov. Rick Perry earlier declared emergency legislation, before sending the overall proposal to the Senate. But Berman, R-Tyler, drew our attention April 4 when he told the House Committee on Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence that Shariah law is "being done in Dearborn, Mich," adding:"The judges in Dearborn are using, and allowing to be used, Shariah law. Also in England... in France and in Germany, the use of Shariah law is being allowed as well." Keeping this fact-check stateside, we wondered if judges in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb, practice Shariah law. But first, what is it? According to an April 3 United Press International news article, Shariah is "roughly comparable to the Talmudic tradition in Judaism" — in other words, religious principles which adherents seek to live by. Testifying before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on March 30, Farhana Khera, the president of Muslim Advocates, a legal resource for the Muslim community, said Shariah guides Muslims "in the way that religious law guides those everyday activities for Christians and Jews, and other faith communities in the United States." When we sought back-up for Berman’s claim, his legislative director, Sharon Guthrie, guided us to Grand Prairie, Texas, resident Dorrie O’Brien, who told us she’s a speaker for Act! For America, a Florida-based group that describes itself as a citizen action network that "defends America and democratic values against the terror and tyranny of radical Islam." O’Brien pointed us to a Feb. 24 post on "Creeping Sharia," a blog about "the slow, deliberate and methodical advance of Islamic law (Shariah) in non-Muslim countries," according to the blog’s "about" page. The blog says that on June 18, police at Dearborn’s annual Arab International Festival jailed four Christian missionaries, one of whom was "peaceably discussing his Christian faith with Muslim youths" and three others who were "allegedly ‘breaching the peace.’" According to a June 20, 2010 Detroit Free Press news article, the missionaries were with the group Acts 17 Apologetics, which seeks to convert Muslims to Christianity. They were arrested and jailed for disorderly conduct. One of the four, Negeen Mayel, was also charged with failure to obey a police officer’s order — to put down the camera she was videotaping with — according to the article. A July 27 Free Press news article says Dearborn Mayor Jack O'Reilly and others had said the missionaries were trying to provoke festival goers, according to the article. "Creeping Sharia" has a different take: "The Christians were led away in handcuffs by police to the applause and cheers of Muslim onlookers who just witnessed a victory of Shariah law over the Christians." The blog post quotes Richard Thompson, president and chief counsel for the Thomas More Law Center, as saying: "Muslims dominate the political and law enforcement process in Dearborn. It seems that police were more interested in placating the mayor and Muslims than obeying our Constitution. Shariah law makes is a crime to preach the Gospel to Muslims. This a classic example of stealth Jihad being waged right here in America." The Christians were charged with disorderly conduct after police said theyr eceived a complaint from a Christian volunteer working at the festival who said he was harassed by the group, according to a Sept. 25 Free Press news article. When the missionaries stood trial in September, festival volunteer Roger Williams testified that at the festival, they "were making me nervous and I felt intimidated." A jury acquitted the missionaries, according to the Free Press. Mayel was found guilty of failure to obey the officer’s order. The Dearborn dust-up made national headlines that month, when U.S. Senate hopeful Sharron Angle of Nevada claimed that the city is subject to Shariah law. "We’re talking about a militant terrorist situation," she said. Weeks later, O’Reilly appeared on CNN to dispute the characterization. "There’s no Shariah law in Dearborn, Mich.," he said. In an Oct. 11 letter to Angle, he wrote: "Contrary to the Shariah law misconception, there are Christian Evangelists who proselytize to Muslims 365 days a year without resistance or interference from anyone." On Feb. 22 of this year, the Thomas More Law Center, which describes itself as a law firm that defends and promotes Christians’ religious freedom, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Dearborn’s mayor, chief of police and two executives for the American Arab Chamber of Commerce, which puts on the festival. The case is still pending, and neither the city, police department or law center responded to our queries. Dawud Walid, executive director of the Detroit-based Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called Berman’s claim "complete rubbish." Shariah is a "spiritual compass" that Muslims live by, not a "thick codex of laws," he said. "Obviously the U.S. and Michigan Constitution are the law of the land in Dearborn, Mich." He offered this example: Islamic law prohibits a Muslim from marrying a Hindu. "But obviously if a Muslim male wants to go to the justice of the peace with a Hindu woman, he can marry a Hindu woman," he said. "Actions guided by a person’s belief in what God wills for him is not anything that can be endorsed by the state." However, as PolitiFact Florida reported this month, courts may use religious laws when interpreting a contract that specifies, for example, Shariah as the legal foundation, and both parties agreed to those laws from the beginning. Markus Wagner, a professor of international law at the University of Miami’s School of Law, said: "It happens all the time... We could use Jewish law, Canaanite law, so long as it doesn’t contravene public policy." Detroit attorney Noel Saleh, who specializes in civil liberties and immigration law, told us in an email that "judges in Michigan (like all judges in the United States) are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the state." The Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution makes the Constitution and the laws of the United States "the supreme law of the land." As for the way Berman is suggesting judges use Shariah law, Saleh said: "There are no courts in Dearborn, Michigan that utilize Shariah law in any way, shape or form. This is an urban legend." Lastly, we searched online and in the Lexis-Nexis database, which archives news articles, for evidence of Berman’s claim. We found nothing but unsubstantiated claims and speculation. As we were finishing up this item, Mark Somers, chief judge for the 19th District Court in Dearborn, emailed us this statement: "As with every justice, judge and magistrate of this state, the judges and magistrates of Michigan’s 19th District Court are sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Michigan and to faithfully discharge the duties of the office to which they have been elected or appointed. There are no other laws that govern the adjudication of the matters within the jurisdiction of this court." All told, Dearborn Muslims, like all U.S. Muslims, may follow Shariah law in their personal lives and may enter into contracts — such as pre-nuptial agreements — bound by their principles. So may adherents of other religious faiths. And judges may use religious laws to interpret such contracts, providing all parties agree from the beginning. Far as we can tell, though, judges don’t use Shariah law in lieu of the U.S. Constitution or state laws — nor are they doing so in Dearborn. We rate the statement False.

pomt-11658	When President Barack Obama "signed the executive order (on DACA, he) actually said he doesn't have the right to do this."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/09/donald-trump/obama-hedged-didnt-say-he-lacked-legal-right-daca/	President Donald Trump sat with congressional leaders for an open conversation about cutting a deal on the fate of about 700,000 undocumented young immigrants whose parents brought them to America as small children. Trump said last September that an Obama-era policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) would end this March unless Congress acted. "President Obama, when he signed the executive order, actually said he doesn't have the right to do this," Trump said Jan. 9, 2018. "You have to go through Congress. Whether he does or whether he doesn't, let’s assume he doesn’t. He said it." We looked at Obama’s Rose Garden speech announcing the new policy that allowed those who qualified to register and apply for two-year deferrals. Obama didn’t say that he lacked the right to act. In contrast, he emphasized his authority to set priorities until Congress approved the DREAM Act, a measure that would formalize the legal status of this group of immigrants. "In the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we’ve tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places," Obama said June 15, 2012. "This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people." Obama did urge Congress to act, saying, "There is still time for Congress to pass the DREAM Act this year, because these kids deserve to plan their lives in more than two-year increments." It has been a theme among Republicans and conservatives that before he penned DACA, Obama had said that he was bound by law to pursue deportations. The Speaker of the House John Boehner posted a list of 22 times when Obama said "he couldn’t ignore or create his own immigration law." Indeed, Obama did tell a Univision audience Oct. 25, 2010, that "I'm president, I'm not king." But he continued on to say, "If Congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported, then I can exercise some flexibility in terms of where we deploy our resources, to focus on people who are really causing problems as opposed to families who are just trying to work and support themselves." In March 2011, he again told Univision, "there are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as president." And then he said, "That does not mean, though, that we can't make decisions, for example, to emphasize enforcement on those who’ve engaged in criminal activity." In the fall of 2011, he said, "I just have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true." Then he added, "What we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources, and say we’re not going to go chasing after this young man or anybody else who’s been acting responsibly and would otherwise qualify for legal status if the DREAM Act passed." Whether Obama’s action was legal or not, he consistently left open the option to focus enforcement on more dangerous illegal immigrants. Where he was particularly vague, however, was on the scope of his flexibility and the tools at his disposal. DACA took a major step by creating a formal process for applicants, but he justified it as an extension of the concept of selective enforcement. In announcing DACA, Obama emphasized that it was a temporary policy. He did not issue an executive order. Rather, the policy was released by the Department of Homeland Security. Later in his presidency, Obama expanded the approach of deferred action to families, and for various reasons, that was blocked by the courts. There is no question that his interpretation of his authority grew over time. Our ruling Trump said that when Obama signed the executive order on DACA, he acknowledged that he didn’t have the right to do it. The smaller errors in that statement are that Obama didn’t sign an executive order, and that when he announced the new policy, he didn’t say that he lacked the authority. The bigger issue is that in 2010 and 2011, Obama reserved the right to enforce immigration laws selectively. His emphasis was on deporting criminals who were undocumented, rather than undocumented students or workers who presented no threat to public safety. To be sure, Obama drove home the point many times that his hands were tied and that he had to follow the law. His words about his legal flexibility were vague and gave no hint about the DACA program, an approach that took the idea of selective enforcement to a new level. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03153	"The government does not need a warrant to read your old emails."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/10/tom-graves/your-old-emails-could-be-government-inbox-now/	You’ve got mail. And depending on how long its been since you’ve read it, the government can read it, too. That’s the claim U.S. Rep. Tom Graves made in a district update to his constituents this summer. "It’s shocking, but true," Graves, R-Ranger, said in the emailed update. "The government does not need a warrant to read your old emails. How can this be? Simply put, our privacy laws are outdated." Since May, when former government defense contractor Edward Snowden leaked the details of two National Security Agency spy programs that track phone and Internet communications, there has been a heightened interest in how much privacy Americans actually have. PolitiFact Georgia gets and sends a lot of email. We wanted to know whether our bygone missives could be subject to government perusal, so we went looking for answers. Graves’ update referenced the Email Privacy Act that he introduced, along with U.S. Reps. Kevin Yoder and Jared Polis, to update the current electronic communication privacy laws. The bill, introduced in May, has gained 137 bipartisan co-sponsors and has been referred to a House committee. The Graves bill is a companion to a similar bill being pushed in the Senate by U.S. Sens. Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee. The Senate bill passed out of committee and is up for a full chamber vote. If passed, both bills would update the current law that governs data storage, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. The ECPA, passed in 1986, regulates government access to private information that is transmitted and stored on the Internet, such as email. The law considers emails stored on third-party servers for longer than 180 days as abandoned. The 1986 law allows federal agencies to obtain a subpoena -- but doesn’t require a warrant from a judge -- to view the records. (Emails less than 180 days old do require a judicial warrant to obtain.) "The (ECPA) was written at a time when people didn’t store emails on a server and there was no cloud. Storage was expensive and most people didn’t keep emails long -- they downloaded things to the desktop," said Mark Stanley, a campaign and communications strategist for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit public policy organization that works to improve privacy in communications technology. When the law was written, users of the early Internet often downloaded emails directly to their hard drives to save them. Service providers deleted messages on their servers immediately to free up valuable storage space. Today, storage space is practically unlimited. Deleting messages from your inbox doesn’t preclude them from still existing on your computer’s hard drive, your email provider’s server, or in the inbox or on the server of the person receiving the email. Graves’ email privacy act would drop the 180-day provision from the existing law and require a warrant to obtain the emails. The bill "would ensure that Fourth Amendment protections Americans already have for mail, phone calls, and other paper/hard documents are extended to their soft communications too," the three congressmen wrote in a Wired op-ed. One exception exists to the current electronic communications privacy law, but not in our area. A ruling in a 2010 federal appeals court case, United States v. Warshak, found that police violated a man’s constitutional rights by reading his emails without a warrant. The Supreme Court has not addressed this case, and the ruling only applies to states in the court’s 6th Circuit jurisdiction of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. Because of this ruling, email and Internet companies Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo require warrants and subpoenas to release emails and other stored data. But there is no guarantee that their requirements would hold up in court. A coalition of communications, privacy and human rights groups have lobbied Congress to update the current electronic data bill. The Washington Post editorial board urged lawmakers to close the email loophole in a July editorial. Privacy expert and professor John Soma, who leads the Privacy Foundation at the University of Denver, also vouched for Graves’ claim. Soma said the legislators’ bill is tame in regards to what data management changes should be made to the law. But getting the bill passed could be difficult. GovTrack, which follows federal legislation, gives Graves’ bill only an 8 percent chance of being enacted; the Senate bill fares a bit better at 14 percent. Soma gives it a better chance, especially after Snowden revealed the government’s surveillance practices. "I’d give (the bill) a 50-50 chance, maybe more," Soma said. "We do need a change." So, does Graves’ claim about email make it to the inbox or get filtered into junk mail? The Georgia congressman said the government doesn’t need a warrant to read our old emails. Current law, in place before many modern technology advances, does not include a provision protecting email over 180 days old from the government’s prying eyes. Graves and a cadre of congressional members are working to update the privacy laws. But in the meantime the old rules stand. We rate Graves’ claim True.

pomt-05375	Says Mitt Romney "has refused to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/08/barack-obama/life-julia-says-romney-refused-say-if-he-would-sig/	Updated Thursday, October 25th, 2012 at 2:08 p.m. Equal pay is just one reason Julia, a character created by the Obama campaign, would be better off under the president than under Mitt Romney, a Web graphic claims. The cartoon "The Life of Julia," compares the candidates' impact on Julia at a dozen points in her life. At age 23, she’s shown reading a newspaper with the headline, "Equal pay 4 equal work." She’s starting her career as a Web designer. "Because of steps like the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, Julia is one of millions of women across the country who knows she’ll always be able to stand up for her right to equal pay," the graphic says. Romney, on the other hand, "has refused to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act," the graphic says. We wondered: Did Romney refuse to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the act? And what would that mean for Julia? Obama’s first law The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill signed by President Barack Obama on Jan. 29, 2009, made it easier for workers to pursue wage discrimination claims. Just seven Republicans voted for the bill. It updated 1960s civil rights and age discrimination laws to reset the statute of limitations on such claims with each new paycheck. In 2007, the Supreme Court had ruled in Ledbetter vs. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. that the 180-day statute of limitations started from the day an employer made the decision to discriminate — making it harder for employees who claimed such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay. Just what did Romney have to say about the law? We asked the Romney and Obama campaigns and conducted our own search. Romney’s campaign didn’t respond, but the Obama campaign pointed us to a Washington Post blog post and an ABC News interview. The Washington Post report by Greg Sargent, the week before the ABC News interview, was based on an April 11, 2012, conference call between Romney advisers and reporters. In a clip, Sam Stein, a political reporter at the Huffington Post, asks, "Does Gov. Romney support the Lilly Ledbetter Act?" A Romney adviser answers, "Sam, we’ll get back to you on that." Sargent, in his blog post, cites a TPM report that Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul later clarified in an email: "He supports pay equity and is not looking to change current law." So, Romney’s advisers didn’t say "whether he would have vetoed or signed" the act. But it’s a stretch to say he "refused" to say — the question wasn’t about whether he would have vetoed or signed the law, but whether he supported it. What about the ABC News interview? On April 16, 2012, reporter Diane Sawyer asked Romney, " If you were president — you had been president — would you have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Law?" Here’s how Romney responded: ROMNEY: "It's certainly a piece of legislation I have no intention of changing. I wasn't there three years ago —" SAWYER: "But would you have signed it?" ROMNEY: "... I'm not going to go back and look at all the prior laws and say had I been there which ones would I have supported and signed, but I certainly support equal pay for women and — and have no intention of changing that law, don't think there's a reason to." In this case, Romney did refuse to say whether he would have signed the bill. But he also said he supported "equal pay for women" and had "no intention of changing that law." Those news reports were consistent with others we found. Our ruling The Obama campaign said Romney "has refused to say whether he would have vetoed or signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act." That’s essentially what happened in Romney’s ABC News interview in April, but the claim leaves out some details that matter to Julia. The relevant point for Julia isn't whether Romney would sign the bill — it's already the law — but his decision not to change it. Romney also said he "certainly support(s) equal pay for women," and has "no intention of changing that law." Still, the Obama campaign is correct that he dodged the question, so we rate the claim Mostly True. CORRECTION: A previous version of this item said the Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision made it "impossible for employees who learned of such discrimination later to get relief, such as back pay." In fact, the court declined to address the question of whether employees who learned of discrimination after the statute of limitations expired would be protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

pomt-01989	"It was Dan Sullivan who wrote a bill to cut Alaskans out of those decisions" about where they can hunt and fish.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/13/put-alaska-first-pac/pac-ad-says-republican-senate-candidate-dan-sulliv/	In a state where fishing and hunting are a way of life, it's no surprise that the issue is packing a punch in the Alaska Senate race, a high-profile race in which incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Begich is seeking a second term. Put Alaska First -- a political action committee funded by the Senate Majority PAC, which has close ties to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. -- released a television ad blasting Republican candidate Dan Sullivan for his involvement in crafting a controversial state bill that, according to the ad, would affect Alaskans’ input on fishing and hunting policy. The ad features Sam Cotten, a resident of Eagle River, Alaska, and a former state senator, saying, "The fishing industry is part of who we are here in Alaska. When decisions are being made about where we can hunt, where we can fish, Alaskan voices shouldn't be taken out of the picture." The ad then cuts to a narrator, who says, "But it was Dan Sullivan who wrote the bill to cut Alaskans out of those decisions." We wondered whether Sullivan, one of two leading candidates in the GOP primary, had really made that kind of power grab, so we took a closer look. Who’s behind the bill? The claim stems from a piece of controversial legislation presented to the Alaska State Legislature in January 2013. House Bill 77, supported by the state Department of Natural Resources, aimed to improve and speed up the process for approving land and water-use permits. Most of the public outcry focused on a provision in the original draft that would in some cases have allowed the DNR to award general-use permits without giving the public the opportunity to review or comment on the proposals. The bill also took away the right of tribes, groups and individuals to secure in-stream fishing areas that were protected from mining and other development projects. The bill's main critics were fishers, tribal groups, conservation groups and people who felt the DNR was taking power away from individuals. Hundreds of people signed up to offer public testimony against the legislation, and few stood up to support it. When the bill was introduced, Sullivan was the Commissioner of Natural Resources, and by most accounts, he was deeply involved in the overarching effort to overhaul the permitting system and reduce backlogs. "Whether he personally penned any part of the bill is uncertain, but he definitely had some influence," said Carl Shepro, a political science professor emeritus at the University of Alaska. "That lends some credence to the statement" in the ad, he said. Throughout his tenure as commissioner, which ended in the fall of 2013, Sullivan defended the DNR’s efforts to change with the permitting system. "I led that effort, and I’m proud of that effort," Sullivan said in an interview with Radio Kenai in March 2014, referring to his overall strategy to overhaul the permitting system. But the bill's language was broad, so critics were worried that the DNR could potentially permit large-scale and high-impact projects -- such as mining -- without public input. That, in turn, could have handed the commissioner -- Sullivan, at the time -- significantly more power. However, the ad glosses over a few nuances. First, the ad doesn’t note that the bill failed to make it through the Alaska Legislature in 2013, largely due to public opposition, and again in 2014. Second, the ad’s wording suggests that Sullivan’s sole intent was to cut out public discussion of permitting decisions, when in fact that was a byproduct of a broader effort to improve the permitting process. The idea of the original bill was that the commissioner should be able to issue a permit for small-scale proposals -- such as allowing someone to dock their boat near their waterfront property -- without notifying the public. And third, the ad may have exaggerated the potential impact of the measure, implying that the bill would have kept Alaskans out of discussions regarding hunting, rather than just fishing. Some HB 77 critics have said the broad language would have allowed it to affect hunting, because land access plays a big role in hunting, Shepro said. If the DNR limited land use through the authority granted under HB 77’s original draft, the department could have restricted hunting without having to go through public review processes. Still, this is speculative. The bill’s text does not make any reference to hunting or game activity. And judging by what the law’s critics complained about, the main concerns centered on fishing, not hunting. The Sullivan campaign said the law would not affect the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s regulatory authority over hunting. But the ad’s creators thought the bill’s language created a slippery slope. "If you are a hunter, and you hunt a popular state-owned tract of land, the commissioner can hand that land over to a developer without a public hearing and without adhering to existing laws and (regulations), under HB 77," said Jim Lottsfeldt, Put Alaska First senior adviser. Our Ruling: Put Alaska First PAC said in a television ad that Sullivan "wrote a bill to cut Alaskans out of" decisions about where citizens can hunt and fish. As commissioner of natural resources, Sullivan did indeed push legislation to limit the public's ability to review and comment on development proposals. However, the ad glosses over a few complicating issues, including the stated goal of the proposal, and suggests, rather speculatively, that hunters could be affected. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate this claim Half True.	None	Put Alaska First PAC	None	None	None	2014-06-13T17:01:38	2014-06-02	['None']

pomt-06099	Rick Santorum "reformed welfare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/04/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-ad-claims-he-reformed-welfare/	A new Rick Santorum campaign ad asks, "Who has the best chance to beat Obama?" The answer: Santorum, of course. As images appear of the Republican presidential hopeful on the stump and walking with his wife, a voice-over calls him a "full-spectrum conservative" and "a favorite of the tea party for fighting corruption and taxpayer abuse." Then the words "reformed welfare" pop up in white type. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator who also served two terms in the House, made welfare reform a central issue during his congressional career. So we wondered, among the many prominent politicians who also have worked to reform welfare, how does he stack up? Efforts in Congress When Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, he pledged to "end welfare as we know it." Santorum, then serving in the House, was among a group of Republicans determined to hold the new president to his promise. In early 1993, Santorum helped write legislation that tied cash benefits to participation in work and educational programs, with the goal of moving people off of welfare rolls permanently. Newspaper accounts from the time call him a "chief sponsor" of the bill who "helped shape the Republican position on welfare reform." That bill sputtered, but what evolved was a years-long battle between Clinton and Republicans in Congress over how to reform the system. In 1994, Santorum was elected to the Senate, where he immersed himself in the fight. "The strict conservatives believe the bottom line is, let's cut this thing, let's save money," he said in 1995, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. "The rest of us, which I believe is a majority of Republicans, believe this is the number-one societal problem, that it's at the root of the disintegration of families in the inner city, the social decay we have seen in the last 20 years. "What we have to stop doing is guaranteeing people failure. These programs have done nothing but keep people poor. Sure they put food on the table, but they don't provide much hope." Clinton vetoed two bills before signing landmark legislation in August 1996 that ended guaranteed cash benefits put in place under Franklin Roosevelt and transferred more control over welfare to the states. Experts’ takes We talked to several experts about the ad’s claim, and all agreed that Santorum was at the forefront of the welfare reform fight, even as a junior legislator. "He certainly didn't reform welfare by himself," said Lawrence Mead, a politics and public policy professor at New York University and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "He was less important than the more senior congressional leaders or President Clinton, let alone the myriad state and local officials who finally made it happen at the local level. But he was more important than the average member of Congress. The whole episode was a credit to him." Ron Haskins, who was a key Republican staffer in drafting the reform and who also wrote the book Work Over Welfare: The Inside Story of the 1996 Welfare Reform Law, had this to say: "He deserves as much credit for welfare reform as anyone with the possible exceptions of (former Florida congressman) Clay Shaw and Bill Clinton. He wrote the bill that was part of the Contract with America which set the pattern for all subsequent Republican welfare reform bills. In addition, he ran the floor debate in the Senate even though he was a freshman member," Haskins, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an e-mail. Our ruling Santorum’s ad said simply that he "reformed welfare." Santorum was a leader in the 1990s efforts to overhaul the nation’s system for aiding poor families, reshaping the program into one that encourages recipients to move toward financial independence. He had a hand in writing Republican bills and was influential in the process in both the House and Senate. But no one reformed welfare alone. Although he was a key player, Santorum’s ad ignores others who helped usher in change -- including some who played even larger roles than he did. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-03923	"Kewpie burgers are delicious. An Ohio institution. And they'll cost less thanks to John Kasich's tax cut."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/22/ohio-republican-party/ohio-republican-party-says-kewpee-burgers-would-be/	Sampling the local fare is a staple on the menu of any politician worth his salt. For that reason alone, John Kasich is fortunate to be governor of Ohio. Ohio is the brass buckle on the burger belt. It is Ground Beef Zero. It is Mondo Carne. Rivals stake competing claims, but Ohio can credit two brothers from Akron, Charles and Frank Menches, for inventing and naming the hamburger in 1885. Menches Brothers Restaurants still feature the original recipe. The oldest burger chain, White Castle, is headquartered in Columbus, not far from the home of Wendy's in Dublin. The founder of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee' chains came from Upper Sandusky. The Big Boy, "a meal in one on a double-deck bun," was created as the first double-decker in California, but Manners' in Cleveland and Frisch's in Cincinnati gave it white sauce perfection, inspiring the Big Mac. And so on. When Kasich took his State of the State address on the road last week to Lima, he made a stop that followed the lead of other visitors and then tweeted about it: "Enjoyed a quick Kewpee burger before the State of the State in Lima tonight." The Ohio Republican Party tweeted its own comment: "Kewpie burgers are delicious. An Ohio institution. And they'll cost less thanks to John Kasich's tax cut." Is that true -- or a whopper? PolitiFact Ohio dug in with relish. First, we will stipulate that Kewpee burgers are delicious and worthy of the restaurant's slogan: "Hamburger pickle on top! Makes your heart go flippity flop!" We agree that the diner is an Ohio institution, even though @ohiogop misspelled its name. One of the oldest burger chains in the country, Kewpee was started in Michigan (Wendy’s founder Dave Thomas once said that the Kewpee near his home in Michigan inspired him to go into the business) but has its headquarters in Lima. Its downtown location is on the National Register of Historic Places. Kasich's "tax cut" cited by @ohiogop is the sales tax plan that is part of the governor's proposed two-year budget. To help pay for a 20 percent cut in the state's income tax, the plan would cut the state sales tax rate, from 5.5 percent to 5 percent, while widening its scope to nearly all service purchases. Restaurant meals -- such as Kasich's pre-speech Kewpee burger -- are covered by the sales tax. Take-out meals are not taxed, and would not be under Kasich's proposal. In Allen County, where Lima is located, state and county taxes combine for a 6.5 percent sales tax rate, the Ohio Department of Taxation told us. Under Kasich's plan, the rate would drop to 5.8 percent. That would cut the tax on a plain Kewpee burger -- priced at $1.80 each -- from 12 cents to 10 cents, according to the tax collection schedule posted by the Department of Taxation. So what's the take-away? It is accurate to say that a delicious burger eaten at the iconic Kewpee in Lima would cost 2 cents less under Kasich's tax proposal, leaving all other factors unchanged. Someone eating two burgers a week would save enough in 10 months to buy another burger. The price of take-out burgers would remain the same, however. That’s an important clarification that gives the statement a rating of Mostly True.	None	Ohio Republican Party	None	None	None	2013-02-22T16:40:30	2013-02-19	['John_Kasich', 'Ohio']
pomt-04693	When it comes to jobless workers, "Mitt Romney says he likes to fire people."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/jack-markell/mitt-romney-said-he-likes-fire-people-said-delawar/	Just because Republican Mitt Romney was successful in business doesn’t mean he deserves to be president, said Delaware Gov. Jack Markell at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. "Because when you move from business to government, what matters are the lessons you learn and what those lessons say about your priorities," Markell said in his Sept. 5, 2012, speech. "And Mitt Romney learned all the wrong lessons." Markell then told a story about a refinery closing in Delaware, noting his own efforts to help laid-off workers find jobs. "Let me ask you: What do you think Mitt Romney would have done if that call came in? Well, Mitt Romney already told us what he would do. Mitt Romney says he likes to fire people. And Barack Obama? He likes to see people hired," Markell said. Markell here is cherry-picking Romney’s words and putting them in a context Romney never intended. Those words from Romney date back to Jan. 9, 2012, when Romney was speaking about health care -- not the economy or jobs -- at the Nashua, N.H., Chamber of Commerce. Specifically, he was talking about what should happen if people aren’t happy with their health insurance provider. "I want individuals to have their own insurance," Romney said. "That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep you healthy. It also means if you don’t like what they do, you can fire them. I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. You know, if someone doesn’t give me a good service that I need, I want to say I’m going to go get someone else to provide that service to me." At the time, Romney knew he had made a gaffe that opponents would seize on: "Things can always be taken out of context. And I understand that that's what the Obama people will do. But, as you know, I was speaking about insurance companies and the need to be able to make a choice. And my comments entirely reflected that discussion, which is we should be able to choose the insurance company of our choice." We should note that Romney has done the same thing to Obama, who flubbed the line "you didn’t build that." (At the Republican National Convention, speakers repeated variations of the line over and over.) We put the claim on the Truth-O-Meter when the Romney campaign said in a Web video, "President Obama recently said: ‘If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.’ Clearly, this President doesn't understand how our economy works." Actually, Obama was talking about the importance of government-provided infrastructure and education to the success of private businesses. We rated the Romney campaign’s statement False. Still, two wrongs don’t make a right. Romney never said anything about liking to fire people when it came to laid-off workers. Our ruling Markell talked about helping laid-off workers find jobs, then said, "What do you think Mitt Romney would have done if that call came in? Well, Mitt Romney already told us what he would do. Mitt Romney says he likes to fire people." He’s cherry-picking Romney’s words and putting them in an entirely different context. What Romney actually said was, "I like being able to fire people who provide services to me," and he was talking specifically about switching health insurance companies if a provider isn’t giving good service.

pomt-06263	State budget cuts for local schools resulted in "nearly 4,000 educator layoffs"	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/28/wisconsin-education-association-council/weac-says-state-budget-cuts-led-nearly-4000-educat/	When schools reported a 1 percent drop in property taxes collected statewide, Gov. Scott Walker hailed the news as evidence his revenue freeze had worked. But the state’s largest teachers union groaned, saying state aid cuts and the freeze were harming schools. "Through a devastating state budget that cut $1.6 billion from Wisconsin public schools while at the same time tying the hands of local school boards from raising revenue to meet the needs of students, the governor has delivered a one-two punch to our schools," Mary Bell, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said in a news release. The release added: "FACT: 97 percent of school districts received less state aid this year than last, resulting in nearly 4,000 educator layoffs and larger class sizes." We previously checked the $1.6 billion claim and found an element of truth, but that $800 million to $900 million is the better number for education aid cuts under Walker. We rated that claim Mostly False. But with education a key battleground in the recall drive against Walker, what about the union’s claim of "nearly 4,000 educator layoffs"? The claim was a bit surprising: In that same news release and in a previous statement by Bell, the union has presented the 4,000 figure in a more general way, without blaming it all on layoffs -- "4,000 fewer educators" on the job. The source of the number caught our attention as well. The union attributed it number to a widely reported survey of schools, released Nov. 10, 2011. But that survey -- of more than 80 percent of school districts -- showed about 3,400 fewer school staff in place now compared to last year. Union spokeswoman Christina Brey told us characterizing all the staff losses as "layoffs" was defensible. She said it was a general term, including reductions due to retirements and non-renewal of contracts as well as layoffs. She also said the "nearly 4,000" figure came from WEAC’s estimates of what a 100 percent survey response would have showed, and from a separate state Department of Workforce Development report on public-sector job losses. Is the union right? The state Department of Workforce Development report prompted state officials to estimate a 4,000 worker drop in the local school workforce. But that’s not all "educators." It "could range from teachers and administrators to support staff and janitors," the Capital Times reported. The figure is an estimate based on the widely reported state job figures, but state officials do not get into layoffs or the other reasons for the drop. Separately, the survey by the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators showed a total of 9,000 fewer jobs -- partially offset by 5,600 new hires. That’s the 3,400 net job loss. Again, it would include support staff and non-teaching positions. Of those 9,000, we found about 1,500 -- a bit more than 15 percent -- were from actual layoffs. About half were from retirements and about one third from non-renewal of contracts. So the union claim is off. "I can see where your question comes from, but to the general public, little distinction is made between the underlying causes behind whether or not something is a layoff, a retirement generated by a threat of layoff, a non-renewal, and so forth," Brey told us. To be sure, some local school officials we talked to told us some of the retirees would have been laid off if they had not retired. But there are problems with that line of thought. Retirements did surge after the state budget made it easy for schools to impose higher pension and health costs and make changes in work rules for teachers. But there are significant numbers of retirements every year, so blaming the budget cuts alone for pushing them out overreaches. The same holds for dismissal of educators for poor performance; there’s a baseline level of those every year. As for the union’s notion the 4,000 is on target if you simply apply the pattern of the 80 percent of districts who responded to all districts, that is mathematically correct. It’s a "reasonable layman’s approach," said Nancy Mathiowetz, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee statistics expert. But to draw a precise conclusion as the union did would require study of why some districts didn’t respond, according to Mathiowetz and Marquette University survey research expert Robert Griffin. Griffin said he would use extreme caution before making the leap to 4,000. So, the 4,000 figure is debatable even if you accept the union’s logic. Our conclusion WEAC, the state’s largest teachers union, calls the school staffing losses layoffs, putting the number at 4,000. That shorthand is very misleading given that layoffs were only a fraction of the job losses. Even if you grant that a significant number of retirements were a form of indirect layoff, it’s inaccurate to lump all the departing staffers under that banner. We rate the union’s claim False.

pomt-14371	Says Donald "Trump got, you know, $1.8 billion worth of free media. I got, like, none."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/20/john-kasich/john-kasich-calls-out-donald-trumps-18-billion-wor/	Part of the reason billionaire Donald Trump is enjoying such a lead in the GOP presidential primary is because he hasn’t had to pay much to get his message on the airwaves, Ohio Gov. John Kasich said. Kasich told Chuck Todd on NBC’s Meet the Press that with a less-crowded field, voters are starting to hear his message and platform. But he said Trump had the market cornered on media coverage without spending a dime. "Guess what? In the grassroots, people are getting it," Kasich said in a pre-taped interview for the March 20, 2016, show. "Now, they didn't get it because, frankly you put me on the tube a lot, but Trump got, you know, $1.8 billion worth of free media. I got, like, none. Okay?" We know it feels like it’s all Trump, all the time on TV (and in print and on the radio and the Internet) these days. But could it possibly be that Trump has gotten billions in equivalent media coverage and Kasich has gotten almost none? Let’s go to the tape! Media mentions Kasich’s campaign confirmed to PolitiFact that he was referring to analysis by mediaQuant, a Portland, Ore.,- based media firm that in part tracks political coverage. The metrics were highlighted in a March 15 story by the New York Times that pointed out mediaQuant said Trump topped all presidential candidates with $1.898 billion worth of "earned media" coverage over the last 12 months. Earned media is coverage that candidates don’t have to pay for, such as newspaper and magazine stories, social media posts, and TV broadcasts. That’s different than paid media, which are mostly those campaign ads that blanket markets in an attempt to sway voters, and cost campaigns or super PACS or special interest groups. MediaQuant tracks these mentions and then assigns a dollar value to them depending on the outlet and the quality of the coverage. That includes weighing whether coverage was positive, negative or neutral. Trump scored about 79 percent positive coverage, which is a big difference than, say, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s 40 percent positive coverage. When it comes to Trump, even bad press seems to be good press. "Negative coverage can keep a candidate from expanding his or her coalition, but it rarely affects the core backers -- especially when the support is intense, as it is for Trump," said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. The company didn’t respond to PolitiFact by our deadline, but mediaQuant chief analytics officer Paul Senatori told the New York Times that Trump "has no weakness in any of the media segments." We checked mediaQuant’s figures for ourselves and found the billionaire does lead other candidates on every measured type of coverage, including more than $436 million worth of coverage in February alone. Kasich has not suffered from literally no coverage, but it’s close to nothing by comparison. In the same measurements, mediaQuant said Kasich has received about $37.7 million in coverage over the last year. As the GOP field has winnowed, he’s moved up from 14th on mediaQuant’s coverage rankings in January to eighth in February. (On the Democratic side, mediaQuant said Hillary Clinton has gotten $746 million in earned media, while challenger Bernie Sanders got $321 million.) These figures contrast heavily to the paid coverage both Trump and Kasich have bought. The two candidates have spent $10 million and $14 million, respectively, over roughly the same time frame, the Times noted. We will point out that there doesn’t seem to be any other group that breaks down media coverage in the way mediaQuant does. George Washington University senior fellow Kalev Leetaru follows TV mentions on his 2016 Campaign Television Tracker, but doesn’t measure other media or assign a dollar value. (Leetaru also follows online mentions in a separate 2016 Online News Candidate Tracker, but we'll focus on the TV component.) The Campaign Television Tracker showed Trump received 46.6 percent of all TV mentions of Republican candidates in 2015-16. That far outpaced Kasich, who garnered 3.9 percent. The discrepancy between coverage of Trump and his rivals is out of the ordinary, experts in political campaigns and advertisements told us. While Trump first garnered attention because he was a novelty, like Ross Perot in his 1992 independent run, media outlets continued to cover Trump as his campaign gained traction. That has allowed him to self-promote and share his own message in ways normally reserved for campaign ads, they said. "I have never seen a candidate get as much earned media/free media as Trump. It isn't even close," political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said in an email. "I have been stunned at the amount of time Trump receives. They do telephone interviews. They cover entire speeches. He seems to be everywhere. It is very unusual." Our ruling Kasich said, "Trump got, you know, $1.8 billion worth of free media. I got, like, none." The Ohio governor was referring to an analysis by mediaQuant, which measured so-called earned media coverage of presidential candidates and assigned a dollar value to them. Trump has gotten almost $1.9 billion in the past 12 months, while Kasich has only $37.7 million, according to mediaQuant. That's a ratio of 50 to 1. No other media firms seem to perform this analytical function, but experts told us it does look like Trump is far and away getting more coverage than his GOP rivals. Kasich is exaggerating that he doesn’t get any coverage, but his approximation stands, especially when compared with Trump. We rate this statement Mostly True. Editor's Note, March 22, 2016: We updated this item to reflect Dr. Leetaru also has a tracker for online news separate from television.

pomt-00023	Says MSNBC called the Florida governor’s race for Andrew Gillum before Election Day.	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/no-msnbc-didnt-call-florida-governors-andrew-gillu/	With hours to go before the polls close, some Facebook users are fuming over a recent MSNBC show—and suggesting something is amiss. "FLORIDA POLLS VOTE RIGGED?!!!" reads one post that appeared on Facebook earlier today, Nov. 6. The post includes what looks like a still of a TV segment with photos of Andrew Gillum, the Democrat running for Florida governor, and Ron DeSantis, his Republican opponent. The figures "49.4%" and "3,343,634" appear near Gillum’s picture, and "48.8%" and "3,297,970" next to DeSantis’s. In the top right corner is a graphic that reads: "Close Call: 99% In." "This was shown on MSNBC last night, calling the race for Gillum. Look at the upper right corner-’99% in’ referring to Florida voting," the post says. It then quotes a Huffington Post story without attribution. "Oops," the story stars. "MSNBC on Monday inadvertently aired what looked like live results of the heated gubernatorial election in Florida — a day before the actual voting." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The image actually did air, but the network was quick to say it was an error. (We saw the image that aired on "All In With Chris Hayes" on Nov. 5 at around the 12:15 mark of the episode that was posted to YouTube. Hayes’s correction comes around 28:30.) "Quick clarification here," he said. "Earlier this hour we showed a graphic of the Florida gubernatorial race—may have caught your eye because our system had inadvertently populated some test numbers. Obviously, we do not yet have any vote totals here the night before the election. That was a misfire. Don’t worry, I was pretty confused when I saw it up there." Florida results are not yet available, said Sarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State, and preliminary unofficial election results won’t be posted to the Florida Election Watch website until 8 p.m. Eastern Time. "Florida’s elections are not rigged," Revell said in an email. "No election fraud complaints have been filed with our office today. Our Voter Assistance Hotline is open and has been assisting voters who are calling in with questions about where to vote, how to vote, etc." Though MSNBC aired a graphic that looked like Gillum won the tight gubernatorial race, the network quickly said it was a mistake. As Hayes said earlier in the segment: "We have quite simply never seen a midterm election like this one." But, he added, "we don’t know, let’s be clear, how all this energy will translate to election results." We rate this claim False.

pomt-15121	"Unions did not create" the eight-hour work day and the 40-hour work week. "Henry Ford did."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/09/viral-image/does-8-hour-day-and-40-hour-come-henry-ford-or-lab/	On Labor Day weekend, it’s not unusual to see claims about unions circulating on social media -- both favorable and unfavorable. A shareable graphic critical of organized labor caught the eye of a PolitiFact reader, who decided to forward it to us for a fact-check. The viral image said: Unions did not create: --Weekends --8-hour work days --A "living wage" (doubled worker's pay from $2.34/hr to $5/hr) --Five-day, 40-hour work weeks Henry Ford did in 1926 to attract better workers from his competitors for his automobile plant. Capitalism & competition creates higher wages & better working conditions. #HappyLaborDay. We wondered whether it was correct that Henry Ford, rather than unions, should get credit for creating the eight-hour work day and the 40-hour work week. A long struggle In the United States, a few limited eight-hour-day laws were on the books shortly after the Civil War. One, in Illinois, was passed in 1867, followed in 1868 by a law covering certain classes of federal workers. But neither law was well-enforced, and in most sectors, working hours of 10 to 12 hours were common. So a reduction in the work week became a leading issue for the nascent labor movement. The issue came to a head in 1884, after the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions -- a predecessor of today’s AFL-CIO -- called for all workers to have eight-hour days by May 1, 1886. When that deadline wasn’t met, labor leaders upped the ante by calling for demonstrations. In Chicago, peaceful marches morphed into violence, with an explosion marring a rally at Haymarket Square on May 4, 1886, leaving seven police officers and four workers dead. Subsequent trials, executions and clemencies for the accused made the eight-hour week a top issue nationally and internationally. All of this occurred decades before Ford founded his company in 1903. Ford’s move In 1914, at a time when most workers still lacked a guarantee of eight-hour days, the Ford Motor Co. attracted notice for instituting eight-hour shifts and raising wages in the manner the graphic indicates. (For many Ford workers, the work week remained six days.) The company’s move -- made a dozen years earlier than the graphic said -- was significant, labor historians say. But they add that it’s worth noting some caveats. For instance, Ford’s " ‘sociological department’ had to inspect a worker’s home to make sure they ‘deserved’ the $5 first," said Ileen A. DeVault, a professor of labor relations, law and history at Cornell University. In addition, Ford’s policy wasn’t law, so it wasn’t guaranteed to last indefinitely, even for those who qualified for it. "It was a unilaterally provided benefit at the discretion of the employer and could be yanked away whenever the cost exceeded profits," said Robert Bruno, a professor with the University of Illinois School of Labor and Employment Relations. Companies that operated this way, Bruno said, often revoked these policies when the Great Depression hit. The endgame Ford’s initiative was not widely copied overnight. In 1916, the federal government passed an act to require an eight-hour day and overtime pay for railroad workers, but most workers still didn’t have those protections, and working hours remained a hotly contested issue. "Demands for the five-day week began to proliferate in 1919, a year in which 4 million American workers went out on strike," said Priscilla Murolo, a professor of history at Sarah Lawrence College. "That was about 20 percent of the industrial labor force." It took President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s signing of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 for all workers to see limits on working hours -- initially 44 hours a week, then phased to 42 and eventually 40 by 1940. "When the FLSA was passed in 1938, Saturday working hours were still common," DeVault said. "Saturday noon was the most frequent ‘payday’ time." Given this history, Ford is best described as an early adopter of today’s familiar working hours, experts said. "That happened more than 60 years after workers, through their unions, began organizing for an eight-hour day in the 1860s," said David Bensman, a professor at Rutgers University's School of Management and Labor Relations. "When Ford adopted the eight-hour day for his factory, he was responding to a working force that had been demanding the eight-hour day for a long time." Other experts agreed that labor unions, rather than Ford, deserve the primary credit for today’s working-hour schedule -- including Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Mich. "Henry Ford was an early proponent of the five-day week, but the American Federation of Labor fought for it to be adopted more widely via contract negotiations," Anderson said. "Unions absolutely deserve much credit for the reform." Our ruling A viral image said that Henry Ford, not unions, created the eight-hour work day and the five-day work week. Ford does deserve credit for adopting shorter working shifts, but he was hardly the first employer to do this, and the now-standard working schedule did not become federal law -- and thus a right for all workers -- until almost a quarter-century after Ford’s move. Meanwhile, experts said, unions do deserve credit for keeping the working-hours issue alive, at significant personal sacrifice, for 70 years. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00432	Says Kevin Cramer voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/24/heidi-heitkamp/kevin-cramers-votes-pre-existing-conditions/	The midterm elections are dredging up talk of Obamacare once more, but the Democrats are not calling it by its name. Heidi Heitkamp, a vulnerable Democrat from North Dakota running for Senate re-election, attacked her Republican challenger in a digital ad campaign for his votes to repeal President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Her challenger, Kevin Cramer, has been a representative for North Dakota in the House since 2013. "This is Denise," Heitkamp says in the 30-second spot released on Aug. 16. "She lives in Kildeer. Like 300,000 North Dakotans, Denise has a pre-existing condition. That used to mean no health insurance. For me it’s breast cancer, for Denise it’s heart disease." "She has something she’d like to say to Kevin Cramer. ‘Mr Cramer, I don’t know why you voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. But I know Heidi would never do that.’ " Heitkamp is talking about several votes Cramer cast in 2013 and again in 2016 to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Let’s take a look at what they did. Key takeaways • 300,000 includes everyone with some sort of pre-existing condition. The people whose health plans might be at risk is a fraction of that. • Cramer cast votes to both repeal Obamacare and replace it with skimpier plans. • While these replacements kept protections for pre-existing conditions in place, they stripped some of the safeguards that make those plans affordable today. Cramer and the Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act made sure that people without health insurance got coverage. The problematic sector was the individual, or non-group, market: those not covered by their employer or by the government. They form the smallest part of the market. Before the Affordable Care Act, people in that market could get turned down for having a pre-existing condition (anything from hay fever to cancer); could get charged more for it; or could be offered a health plan that excluded its coverage. Now, all of those things are illegal. The Heitkamp campaign said there are 300,000 individuals with pre-existing conditions in North Dakota, rounding the 275,556 calculated by Health and Human Services in 2009 and 316,000 calculated by the Center for American Progress. Those numbers are credible, but the majority of those individuals are covered by group plans. So voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act is not a vote to strip coverage from all 300,000. Instead, it would jeopardize coverage for the non-group market, which covered 9 percent of North Dakotans in 2016. The ad does not make clear whether Denise is in the group or individual market. Heitkamp sent us Cramer's votes to strip funding for the Affordable Care Act and one vote to repeal it. Cramer’s campaign told us he has always supported coverage of pre-existing conditions, pointing to the American Health Care Act and Graham-Cassidy. Whatever Cramer’s wish is, his votes jeopardize coverage as it stands for pre-existing conditions in the individual market, according to Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care organization. By the letter of the law the bills protect pre-existing conditions. But they take away the mandate that everyone be insured and the subsidies that make that affordable. In practice, plans for individuals in the nongroup market would become exorbitantly priced, if available at all. Our ruling Heitkamp said Cramer voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions. Cramer's votes technically included provisions to prevent health care companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. But the limits of what insurance companies could charge would have been watered down, which would have sent premiums skyrocketing, experts say, to the point that coverage for many would be unattainable. However, only about a tenth of the 300,000 people in the ad would be directly affected by the laws in question. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-09677	"Ronald Reagan faced an even worse recession" than the current one.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/17/sarah-palin/palin-claims-reagan-faced-worse-recession-obama/	It's no secret that Republicans love Ronald Reagan. So it's no surprise to see Sarah Palin, in her new book Going Rogue: An American Life , burnishing the reputation of the Gipper -- and taking a shot at the current president while she's at it. "Our nation is facing great challenges, but I'm optimistic -- and I know there is a way forward," she writes. "Ronald Reagan faced an even worse recession. He showed us how to get out of one." Was the Reagan recession really worse than the current one? We consulted economists and historians and examined statistics to determine if she's right. Here are how some of the key factors stack up. -- Length of the recession . Dating the Reagan recession is somewhat tricky. The National Bureau of Economic Research -- the official arbiter of recession-dating -- classifies one recession as lasting from January 1980 to July 1980 and a second as running from July 1981 to November 1982. The first occurred wholly on President Jimmy Carter's watch, while the second was entirely under Reagan. However, some economists contend that the two recessions actually amount to one "double-dip" recession. The maximum length of the early-1980s recession is nearly three years, but counting the double-dip recessions together while excluding the months of expansion between them leaves 23 months of recession. That's exactly the same length as the Obama recession, which began in December 2007 and continues through today. The whole early 1980s period was longer, but the Obama recession looks likely to continue for at least a little while longer. VERDICT: Call it a wash -- for now. -- Economic growth or contraction . During the double-dip recession, inflation-adjusted GDP declined by 0.6 percent over the full three-year period -- far less than the 2.8 percent decrease seen in the current, two-year recession. But GDP loss in Obama's recession is pretty similar to losses in the second of the two early-1980s dips, when the economy shrank by 2.6 percent. Viewed another way, in the worst full year of the 1980s recession, GDP shrank by 1.9 percent. Unless the economy supercharges during the final quarter of this year, there's a good chance that the contraction in 2009 will be bigger. VERDICT: They're close, but the current recession will likely end up somewhat worse. -- Peak unemployment . Unemployment crested at 10.8 percent at the very end of the Reagan recession, in November and December of 1982. It hasn't gotten that high yet in the Obama recession -- it's currently at 10.2 percent -- but it could well get there in the coming months. VERDICT: Worse under Reagan. -- Rise in unemployment . Some economists say that an even more important factor than peak unemployment is the total distance that unemployment rose over the course of the recession. By that measure, unemployment rose 4.5 percentage points over the full double-dip recession and rose 3.6 points during the second of the two dips. Both measures are lower than the 5.3 percentage-point climb in unemployment seen so far during the Obama recession. VERDICT: Worse under Obama. -- Long-term unemployment . Many economists believe that long-term unemployment is more worrisome than short-term unemployment, because the longer someone goes without a job, the harder it is to get back into the work force, and, in turn, the harder it is for the economy as a whole to move forward. And there's a lot more long-term unemployment now than there was during the early 1980s. In 1982, the final year of the Reagan recession, short-term unemployment -- that is, joblessness lasting less than five weeks -- hovered around 3.7 million. That's not much different than the 3.3 million or so short-term unemployed we've seen so far during 2009. The picture is quite different for long-term unemployment, which is defined as 27 weeks or more without a job. In 1982, the number of people who were unemployed for the long term ranged from 1.2 million to 2.6 million. It's far worse today, with numbers ranging from 2.6 million to 5.6 million. In fact, in October 2009, the average duration of someone being unemployed reached 26.9 months -- the longest on record. VERDICT: Much worse under Obama. -- Personal income . Personal income actually rose during the Reagan recession (up 28 percent over the full three years and up 7 percent during the second of the two dips). During the Obama recession, personal income has fallen by about 1 percent over the two years. VERDICT: Worse under Obama. -- Industrial production . Industrial production means somewhat less these days, in postindustrial America, but it's still a useful barometer for economic activity. Under the Reagan recession, industrial production fell by 9 percent over the double-dip recession and 8.6 percent during the second dip alone. By contrast, industrial production has shrunk during the Obama recession by 12 percent. VERDICT: Worse under Obama. -- The stock market . Economists disagree about the merits of including the stock market as a factor when gauging recessions, but with many more Americans invested in stocks now than 30 years ago, a downturn in stock values can have both tangible and psychological effects. As it happens, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose during the Reagan recession and has plunged during Obama's. It climbed by 19 percent during the full, double-dip recession and rose by 9 percent during the second dip alone. By contrast, the Dow has fallen 22 percent during the current recession. VERDICT: Worse under Obama. -- Housing prices . The Reagan recession may have been bad for unemployment, but it was good for real estate. Over the double-dip recession, house prices rose by 11.4 percent. During the second dip, the rise was smaller -- 2.2 percent -- but still in positive territory. To be fair, that was in an era of much higher inflation. Still, during the Obama recession, house prices have fallen 5.7 percent, a decline much faster than prices as a whole. And the experience of seeing one's house value plunge only adds to the psychological wallop. VERDICT: Much worse under Obama. -- Foreclosures . The comparisons for foreclosures aren't exactly apples-to-apples due to changes in the housing and mortgage markets. But foreclosures are definitely up. The rate of active foreclosures in the fourth quarters of 1980, 1981 and 1981 ranged from 0.38 percent to 0.67 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the rate was 3.3 percent, and in the second quarter of 2009, it rose again to 4.3 percent. VERDICT: Much worse under Obama. -- Bank failures . The peak bank failure years of the Reagan and Obama recessions -- 1982 and 2009 -- were almost identical in severity. In 1982, 119 banks failed; so far this year, the number is 123. But the year isn't over yet -- and there's no certainty that banks won't continue failing in 2010 and beyond. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures customer deposits, estimates bank failures to cost $100 billion from 2009 through 2013, which prompted the agency to scramble to collect accelerated premiums from the banks it insures, just to make sure it had enough liquid assets on hand to cover new failures. VERDICT: It's a wash so far, but things could get worse in the current recession before they get better. The one factor we've sidestepped until now is inflation. A number of the conservative economists we spoke to believe that the high inflation of the early 1980s made Reagan's challenge worse. But we found significant disagreement with other economists about whether inflation is a good barometer of a recession. Some of them said it can be high in good economic times and low in poor economic times. So we're not rendering a verdict on it to compare the recessions. Still, we'll provide the data below so you can see how they would have compared. They're certainly right that inflation was high. The consumer price index rose by 12.4 percent in 1980, 8.9 percent in 1981 and 3.8 percent in 1982. By contrast, inflation was actually negative in 2008, at -0.08 percent, and is on pace to be about 2.7 percent in 2009. As Richard Rahn, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, recently put it, "Both President Reagan and President Obama inherited an economy suffering from a year of no growth, along with rising unemployment. (The numbers are almost identical.) But Mr. Reagan faced a far direr situation in that inflation was in the double digits and the prime interest rate was at 20 percent. In contrast, Mr. Obama inherited an economy in which inflation was falling (in fact, inflation has been close to zero for this year) and interest rates were very low. A situation in which the number of jobs available is falling is bad enough, but if inflation is also destroying purchasing power, the misery is compounded." Recreating the famous "misery index" -- unemployment plus inflation -- shows higher numbers in the Reagan years, ranging between 13.5 and 19.5. The misery index in the current recession has been lower -- 5.7 in 2008 and 11.8 so far in 2009. So back to Palin's claim that Reagan's recession was more severe. The barometers we examined aren't necessarily equal measurements of the magnitude, but collectively they paint a picture that the current recession -- so far -- is worse than the one under Reagan. Even if we had decided to include inflation as a factor, the measurements would still indicate the current recession is worse. So we find Palin's claim to be False.

pomt-08204	Says you can buy four light bulbs for $1.99 at Walmart, while a single compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) costs "$10 a pop."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/nov/21/joe-barton/rep-joe-barton-says-four-pack-incandescent-bulbs-c/	No secret: Many a GOP congressman wants to repeal the new health care law. Also on U.S. Rep. Joe Barton's legislative bucket list? Retooling energy policy, he said during a Nov. 11 speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation, where the Ennis lawmaker specified something else he'd like to repeal. "In a bill that passed in 2007 or 2008, we prohibited in a few years the sale of incandescent light bulbs, like the one that's shining on me right now from the back of the room," he said. "And I was at Walmart this weekend buying some light bulbs and the traditional incandescent light bulb I believe you can get four for $1.99. The little squiggly pig-tail ones were one for $9.99." Then the dig: "Now, if you're Al Gore, you can afford $10 a pop for squiggly-pig-tailed fluorescent light bulbs. But if you're mainstream America, two or three kids, mom and dad working outside the home, that's not a very good deal. So I think repeal that law right off the bat to show that we're going to put market forces back into play. We'll show the American people that we're serious about an energy policy that actually produces energy for America." Since we're not Al Gore, we wondered if we're getting a bad deal: $9.99 for a compact fluorescent lamp — the squiggly pig-tailed bulb Barton mentions, also known as a CFL — versus $1.99 for a four-pack of traditional bulbs. First, some background: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. Then-President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (conventional light bulbs) and fluorescent lamps (CFLs). Barton voted against it — the law Barton now wants to repeal "right off the bat." While running for president, Barack Obama promised to sign a measure into law that "begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs." He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal has made it into law, though in June 2009, Obama announced changes in lighting standards. Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said those types of lamps represented approximately 45 percent of total lighting energy use. This isn't the first time Barton has spoken out against CFLs. On Sept. 16, Barton and two other representatives introduced a proposal to repeal the section of the act requiring that bulbs use 30 percent less energy than standard incandescents. In a press release from Republicans on the committee, Barton said that "Washington is making too many decisions that are better left to people who work for their own paychecks and earn their own living." Nick Prelosky, an intern in Barton's office, told us that Barton's point was "that the CFLs are more expensive... a lot more expensive than the incandescent bulbs." Barton's press office didn't return our calls on this topic, and after initial communications with Walmart's corporate headquarters, no one answered our queries. So we don't know which Walmart Barton shopped — there's one in his hometown of Ennis — or what the light bulb options were at the store. But at a Walmart Supercenter in Austin, we found a wide selection of bulbs and prices. We found a 15-watt dimming CFL bulb for $11.77 and a four-pack of 100-watt soft-white incandescent bulbs for 84 cents, an even greater price spread than Barton said. But a dimming CFL bulb that costs more than $10 vs. a four-pack of incandescents that costs about $2 isn't exactly apples to apples. We turned to a comparison of CFL and incandescent wattage by Energy Star, a joint federal program of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. According to Energy Star, a 60 watt incandescent bulb produces a minimum light output of 800 lumens, about what a 13 to 15 watt CFL bulb produces. At the store, we found a six-pack of 13-watt CFL bulbs for $7.97. A three-pack was $4.28. Next, we went shopping online. Our "light bulb" search query on Walmart's website returned 136 hits. Again, bulb prices varied. A three-pack of soft-white 13-watt CFL bulbs costs $4.92, according to Walmart's website. A two-pack of soft-white 60-watt incandescents costs $2.54. That's $1.64 per CFL bulb and $1.27 per incandescent. On the pricier end was a two-pack of three-way CFLs for $19.84, which are only sold online, according to Walmart's website. That's $9.92 per bulb — the price Barton bemoans. A two-pack of three-way incandescent bulbs costs $4.26, or $2.13 per bulb. But bulb life is also a factor in cost comparisons. In August 2009, Consumer Reports reported that "swapping regular bulbs for compact fluorescents can save you at least $30 per bulb over the life of a compact fluorescent lightbulb... Some CFLs now cost less than $2 compared with $9 to $25 in 1999. Several lasted five to 10 times as long as regular bulbs in our tests, and Energy Star-qualified models use up to 75 percent less power." In its October issue, Consumer Reports found that the CFL bulbs in its lab "have been cycling on and off since early 2009, or 6,000 hours. For comparison, a typical incandescent bulb lasts only around 1,000 hours." Lastly, we checked in with the Light Bulb Shop on Austin's Burnet Road. When we explained the statement we were fact-checking, Martin Day, a salesman at the store, told us: "You can get cheaper CFLs than $10." The cheapest CFL the store sells costs about $3 each, he said — a four-pack for $12. The cheapest incandescent: 75 cents. Let's review the math. One 13-watt CFL bulb costs as little as $1.30 (the price for a six-pack divided by the number of bulbs), compared to 20 cents for an equivalent 60-watt incandescent bulb. But it would take at least five incandescents to replace it over the average life of a CFL. However, if you want a dimmable CFL, it will definitely cost you. On their face, the prices cited in Barton's statement hold up. Yes, you can go to Walmart and buy a four-pack of incandescent bulbs for $1.88 (online) or 84 cents (at the Austin Supercenter) — prices even lower than Barton aired — and a single CFL bulb for $11.77 (even more than he said). However, Walmart also sells some CFLs for less and other incandescent bulbs for more. More importantly, Barton ignores other relevant factors — wattage and longevity — that undercut a simple price comparison and his suggestion that a "mainstream," two-income family can't afford such energy-saving bulbs. We rate his statement as Barely True. This story has been updated to correct the cost of a 13-watt CFL bulb to $1.64 Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Joe Barton	None	None	None	2010-11-21T06:00:00	2010-11-11	['None']

pomt-10165	Barack Obama "pays for every dime" of his spending plans.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/29/barack-obama/deficit-grows-under-obamas-plans/	At the first presidential debate in Oxford, Miss., John McCain and Barack Obama discussed spending. McCain accused Obama of dramatically increasing spending, and Obama responded. "I don't know where John is getting his figures," Obama said. "Let's just be clear. What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage. I think those are pretty important priorities. And I pay for every dime of it." Obama often discusses how to pay for varying proposals, and he has said he believes "that if you want to propose a new program, you better cut some old ones." He says he will pay for his health care plan, for example, by reducing inefficiencies in the health care system and by rescinding the Bush tax cuts on those making $200,000 or more. But "pay for every dime"? Not to our way of thinking. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that the deficit grows dramatically under both candidates' proposals. Without any changes, the deficit will stand at $2.3-trillion in 2018. Under Obama's plan, the deficit grows even more, to $5.9-trillion by 2018. And it grows even more than that under John McCain's plan, to $7.4-trillion (in part because McCain will continue the Bush tax cuts for all income levels). That doesn't sound like pay-as-you-go to us, for either candidate. The Tax Policy Center's analysis does not include spending cuts to existing programs, but it's difficult to see how spending cuts would erase deficits of this size. Obama has said he would curtail the war in Iraq to save money, while McCain talks about eliminating pork and earmarks from the budget. Neither of those measures would close the gap. Another watchdog group, the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, used a different method to examine the candidates' proposals. They chose to take a snapshot of a single year — 2013 — and calculate how the candidates' proposal would affect the deficit for that year alone. They found that Obama's plan adds about $286 billion to the deficit for that year, while McCain's adds about $211-billion. A few important caveats here: Calculating the costs for new spending proposals, tax cuts, tax increases and spending cuts for the federal government can be complicated. Nobody knows exactly how much some of the candidates' proposals will cost in the end (health care is a good example), and some of their proposals for reducing spending are vague and impossible to substantiate. As for Obama's claim that he "pays for every dime" of his spending plans: If the deficit were to stay the same or grow only modestly as a result of Obama's policies, we would give him a better rating. But independent groups agree that the deficit will grow significantly under an Obama administration, and that's an important yardsitck. We give Obama credit for the level of detail many of his proposals have when it comes to spending and cost. But Obama doesn't pay "for every dime" of his proposals. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00353	"According to SCUBA divers, Summersville Lake is the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River."	mostly false	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/13/jim-justice/west-virginias-summerville-lake-clearest-east/	Does West Virginia have the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River? Gov. Jim Justice said so in a tweet. In the Aug. 17 tweet, Justice said, "According to SCUBA divers, Summersville Lake is clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River. This led to earning its name as ‘The Little Bahamas of the East.’ Check it out for yourself today!" (SCUBA is capitalized because it is an acronym for Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Summersville Lake is a man-made lake in the southern part of West Virginia. The Huntington District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created the lake in the 1960s. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Justice’s tweet links to an article on wvtourism.com, published by the West Virginia Tourism Office, an agency of the West Virginia Department of Commerce. The article describes the lake as great for swimming, boating, and underwater exploration. The destination has dive sites where rock formations can be seen 100 feet underwater. However, the WV Tourism article did not offer a specific source for the claim. We contacted the office, and they did not respond. When we reached out to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Huntington District, Toby Wood, project manager for Summersville Lake, said that the label "The Little Bahamas of the East" originated with a SCUBA magazine. "We consider that a claim-to-fame, and we repeat it often," Wood said. In Google searches, we found references to that nickname attributed to Skin Diver magazine but did not locate the original article. More broadly, however, Wood has "no way of knowing if the lake is the ‘the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River,’ as the governor claimed." We reached out to Peter Oliver, editor-in-chief of the National Association of Underwater Instructors’ magazine, Sources, and he said that from his experience, Summersville Lake has the same color as most lakes and reservoirs. "You’d be OK, I think, to call Summersville ‘one of the clearest,’ but it has that green tint common to almost all freshwater lakes and reservoirs. The water in the Florida spring systems is what we usually call ‘gin clear’ and since the water does not stand in the small lakes but flows out it stays clear," Oliver said. Meanwhile, Christine McCrehin of the American Water Resources Association told PolitiFact that "her organization does not track the information about the clarity of lakes." Our ruling Justice tweeted, "According to SCUBA divers, Summersville Lake is the clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River." This facts on this claim are more opaque than the governor lets on. There’s no question that Summersville Lake attracts divers who appreciate its clear waters, and there is evidence that it has long been called "the Little Bahamas of the East." Justice’s tweet went beyond that, saying specifically that the lake is the clearest in the eastern United States. An Army Corps of Engineers and several independent experts were unable to point to evidence for that first-place ranking. The statement contains an element of truth, but it offers a specific No. 1 ranking without a comprehensive study to back it up. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00029	Says Stacey Abrams posed with a campaign sign that described her as a "communist" and part of the "Muslim-Brotherhood"	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/no-stacey-abrams-did-not-pose-campaign-sign-descri/	An image posted to a Facebook group claims that Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia Stacey Abrams is a "communist" and affiliated with the "Muslim-Brotherhood." The photo, posted to the "Watters World Fans" Facebook group on Nov. 3, shows Abrams smiling next to activist Linda Sarsour. In the viral photo, the two are holding up a blue sign that reads, "Communist Stacey Abrams Governor #MuslimBrotherhood." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As of Tuesday morning, the post had been shared 866 times. The Facebook user who posted it, Yossi Kamar, responded to a message Monday asking about the photo with, "No it is not a fact post." Kamar said she’s not sure where she first saw the photo. "I usually post facts. This one was fake. And lots of people know what," Kamar said. "Stacy (sic) made a mistake posing with Linda. That was more then (sic) enough for people." A reverse image search quickly shows the photo in the viral post was altered. On Jan. 20, Stacey Abrams posted a similar photo on Twitter with Sarsour. In it, the sign they’re holding reads, "Stacey Abrams. Governor." "Proud to stand with activist, organizer and @womensmarch national co-chair @lsarsour during #WomensMarch2018. When women speak up, stand up and show up for progress, incredible things happen. Let’s get to work," Abrams wrote. Sarsour has also tweeted her support for Abrams, and on May 22, wrote, "The engine behind the Stacey Abrams campaign and primary win are Black women. #FollowBlackWomen #TrustBlackWomen #BlackWomenLead #TeamAbrams " Sarsour is a political activist who has championed social justice issues in New York, is the former Executive Director of the Arab American Association of New York and she was recently the national co-chair of the Women’s March on Washington. And according to her website and the New York Times, she’s also a Palestinian Muslim American. Sarsour has tweeted about the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist political organization in Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries, multiple times. She reiterated in 2013 that she doesn’t support them. "That's my position. Simple," Sarsour wrote in a July 2013 tweet. Abrams, who would be the first black woman governor in the United States if she wins, is a United Methodist, according to her Vote Smart candidate profile. In response to PolitiFact’s inquiry, Priyanka Mantha, Abrams’ communications director, sent a link to an Oct. 9 Associated Press story with the headline, "NOT REAL NEWS: Georgia gubernatorial candidate backed by Muslim Brotherhood." "This photo has been doctored to imply that Stacey Abrams has affiliations she does not have," Mantha told The Associated Press at the time. "While true that the photo was taken with one of the co-chairs of the Women’s March in 2018, the sign being held up has been altered in a deceitful attempt to mislead voters." This isn’t the first time a reference to "Muslim Brotherhood" has been used to attack politicians. One ad recently tried to connect Ammar Campa-Najjar, a Democrat running to represent California’s 50th district in the U.S. House race, to the group. We rated that claim Pants on Fire! Our Ruling An altered photo tried to tie Abrams to the "Muslim-Brotherhood," by adding words like "Communist" and "#MuslimBrotherhood," to a photo of her with Palestinian Muslim American activist Linda Sarsour.

pomt-01612	"The pension fund in the city of Providence is only 30 percent funded, about the same level as when he [Taveras] took office."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/31/gina-raimondo/gina-raimondo-says-providences-pension-fund-has-re/	Public employee pensions have been a hot topic in the 2014 primary race for governor because two of the Democratic candidates have had to deal with underfunded plans. During the Aug. 26, 2014 Providence Journal - WPRI debate between Democrats Clay Pell, General Treasurer Gina Raimondo and Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, Raimondo and Taveras swapped barbs about who has administered their respective pension funds most effectively. Taveras, who got concessions from the city's unions, said the state pension fund is underperforming and paying excessive fees. Raimondo, whose changes in the state fund sparked a lawsuit that remains unresolved, countered that "we have great returns with lower risk," and she fired back at Taveras. "The pension fund in the city of Providence is only 30-percent funded, about the same level as when he [Taveras] took office," she said. "[I] fixed a system for the long term. He made small changes and the pension system in Providence is still in crisis." (The U.S. Government Accountability Office recommends that public pension plans should be at least 80 percent funded.) We were curious about what the trend has been in Providence and whether the funding has gone down. We asked the Raimondo campaign for its evidence. Spokesman Eric Hyers sent us links to two documents. The first was a Jan. 19, 2012 report from Providence's pension adviser, Buck Consultants, which tracks funding going back to 1994, when the city had 57.4 percent of the pension money it needed. Since then, the overall trend has been down. The funded ratio had plummeted to 39.3 percent by the last full fiscal year Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. was in office. It had dropped to 34.1 percent by June 30, 2010, when David Cicilline, now a U.S. representative, was in his last year. A year later, when Taveras had been in office for six months, the funded ratio had dropped to 31.94 percent. The second document was the Jan. 31, 2014 valuation report by the city's new pension adviser, Segal Consulting. It reports that as of June 30, 2013, with Taveras in office two and a half years, the funded ratio was virtually the same -- 31.39 percent. And this was after Taveras won union concessions to reduce pension costs. By comparison, the funded ratio for the state employees plan went from 48.4 percent in June 2010, before Raimondo took office, to 56.2 percent as of June 30, 2013 in the most recent audit. Michael D'Amico, Taveras' former director of administration who is now a budget consultant for the city, said it was "a complete oversimplification" to imply that the changes were small because the funded ratio didn't change significantly. The actual cost of the pension system was reduced substantially by negotiating changes such as a 10-year suspension of cost-of-living raises and the elimination of 5- and 6-percent compounded cost of living adjustments, D’Amico said. "We got just about as much as we possibly could have without cutting pensions," said Taveras spokesman David Ortiz. "In a sense, the administration faced a choice: do we push Providence into bankruptcy to give a receiver the ability to cut pensions? "The mayor believed the cost and collateral damage of pushing Rhode Island’s capital city into bankruptcy was not worth extra pension savings we would have been able to pursue," Ortiz said. Said D'Amico: "If we hadn't done anything, the funded ratio would have been much lower." Our ruling When Raimondo said, "The pension fund in the city of Providence is only 30 percent funded, about the same level as when he [Taveras] took office," she was only off by one percentage point, according to the most recent audit of the fund. That funded ratio has not increased since Taveras was sworn in on Jan. 3, 2011. But that percentage was on a downward spiral at the time, so having it stabilize at 31 percent doesn't necessarily reflect "small changes," as Raimondo claimed in the debate. And the changes negotiated between Taveras and the city’s unions are intended to gradually increase the funding ratio. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-08054	On whether the state should ramp up borrowing to build roads.	half flip	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/30/ward-armstrong/del-ward-armstrong-does-half-flip-borrowing-roads/	Drive back with us to 2007 on the rickety road of state transportation plans. We stop on April 4 when the General Assembly, after months of angry debate, passed a bill that empowered unelected authorities to impose regional taxes to build roads in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, established a $1,050 fine for going 20 miles over the speed limit, and authorized $3 billion in state borrowing to improve transportation. The legislation passed the House 85-15. It was a delicate compromise between Democrats who insisted Virginia dedicate new revenues to transportation and Republicans who opposed any statewide tax increase. Newly-installed Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry, was among a number of House Democrats who voted for the final bill. He had opposed earlier versions but voted ‘aye’ in the end because he said the legislation was "the best we could do given the political parameters we all face." "We felt we had to pass a transportation bill, and this was the only thing before us," Armstrong said. Now, let’s inch forward on the road, carefully navigating two sink holes that all but destroyed the transportation plan. In January, 2008, public protests forced the General Assembly to rescind the $1,050 speeding tickets and a host of other steep driving penalties enacted the previous year. A month later, the state Supreme Court ruled the legislature cannot delegate taxing authority to unelected bodies, crashing hopes for road improvements in congested Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads. We’re back, now, where we started. It’s December, 2010. The only tangible lane still open from the 2007 transportation bill is authorization for the state to borrow up to $3.18 billion over 10 years to improve roads. The loans would be paid back by earmarking a third of the state’s tax receipts on insurance premiums. That portion, which now comes to $132 million a year, was formerly used for general services such as education, health care and public safety. Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, wants to compress the $3 billion borrowing period to as little as five years, saying transportation needs are urgent and interest rates are the lowest in decades. Armstrong is strongly criticizing the proposal. "A mere month after an election when the voters said we must stop deficit spending, Bob McDonnell has announced a multi-billion dollar deficit spending plan to fund transportation," Armstrong said in a Dec. 9 news release. "...Unfortunately, the governor’s lack of leadership has resulted in a plan that amounts to a back door tax increase on our children." McDonnell’s office is accusing Armstrong of flip flopping, saying the Democrat doesn’t want to issue bonds to build roads that he "voted for and applauded just three short years ago." "All that’s changed since then is the governor is now a Republican," the administration wrote in "talking points" distributed to GOP lawmakers earlier this month. "...That’s just the definition of partisan politics and it would be laughable if it wasn’t so irresponsible." Armstrong, who is exploring a run for statewide office, has amped his rhetoric this year. But we have a hard time concluding he’s made a u-turn on borrowing to build roads. Although McDonnell is correct that Armstrong voted for the 2007 bill, it’s a stretch to say the minority leader "applauded" the bill. This year as in 2007, Armstrong is saying the state should dedicate a new, reliable revenue stream to fund transportation but has stopped short of suggesting a specific source -- such as an increased gas tax. As in 2007, Armstrong says he may wind up voting unenthusiastically for the borrowing plan. Here’s the hitch: The 2007 bill essentially limited the state to about $318 million a year in road borrowing over a decade; McDonnell would put the cap at about $618 million over five years. Armstrong says he wants to make sure the source earmarked by the General Assembly in 2007 to repay the road bonds -- one-third of the state’s receipts on insurance tax premiums -- can cover the increased immediate debt costs that would come with McDonnell’s plan. If it does, Armstrong said he could support the governor. If it doesn’t, Armstrong said he is concerned lawmakers will cover the increased borrowing cost by taking money from vital services. But Armstrong voted to do just that when he supported the 2007 transportation bill that designated one-third of the tax receipts on insurance premiums to pay back the bonds. The legislation moved that money from the general fund -- used for education, public safety and health -- to a separate transportation budget. So we can’t say Armstrong has been consistent. Nor can we say he’s flipped like a leaf in the wind. A check of 2007 newspaper stories showed Armstrong sounded the same alarm about "raiding the general fund" to pay for roads that he’s issuing today. And just like in 2007, Armstrong says he’s keeping his voting options open. All things considered, we find it a Half Flip.	None	Ward Armstrong	None	None	None	2010-12-30T16:23:56	2010-12-20	['None']

pomt-09929	Oil money from federal leases "can only be used to clean up the mess and damages from drilling."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/15/bill-nelson/sen-bill-nelson-says-offshore-drilling-wont-pay-fl/	Floridians who support offshore drilling to rescue the crippled state budget will be disappointed, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., warned this week. The federal government limits what the offshore drilling revenues can be used for, Nelson said, and it doesn't include things like paying for public schools. "I’ve had a few questions lately about this idea of Florida getting oil-drilling revenues to help with its sagging budget — and, things like schools," Nelson said in a statement on June 15, 2009. "If you’re swayed by this argument and big oil’s latest push to put rigs off the tourism state, then you need to know something: oil money from federal leases cannot be used for that kind of stuff. It can only be used to clean up the mess and damages from drilling. Here’s how the law allows royalty money to be used: mitigation of effects from drilling activities through onshore infrastructure projects; associated planning and administrative costs; coastal protection; and, mitigation of damage to animals or natural resources. There you have it. No budget windfall. Fact is — oil money won’t build schools, or roads or pay teachers. It’ll just 'mitigate' — slow down — the oil industry’s ruination of the fourth largest state’s economy and environment." Some background: In the Gulf of Mexico, which is the focus of the debate over more oil production, offshore drilling is banned within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 100 miles of the Florida Panhandle through 2022. But in early June, the U.S. Senate energy committee approved a measure to allow oil and gas drilling just 45 miles off Florida's west coast. Nelson strongly opposes drilling off Florida's coast, and has threatened to filibuster if the amendment is attached to a broader energy bill. Nelson includes a key caveat in his warning about how Florida might be able to spend royalties from drilling. He notes that he's talking about federal leases. That's important because the federal government generally controls waters more than 10 miles offshore, while Florida and some other states control the waters inside 10 miles. So if Florida allowed drilling within those 10, it could use proceeds from oil leases however it sees fit, including for teacher salaries. (There's also a provision where the state could get some money for leases between 10 and 13 miles.) Currently, four states receive money from federal royalties — Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Under federal law, that money can only be used for protecting and restoring the coast through projects such as conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources. Nelson is generally correct about the requirements as they relate to those four states, said Eileen Angelico, a spokeswoman for the federal government's Gulf of Mexico Minerals Management Service. But you can't assume the same provisions will apply to Florida, she said. "There's no guarantee that if Florida is added that it'll have to go along with the same rules," she said. "(Congress) can write it however they want to." We think there's also a danger that people will misinterpret Nelson's comments, to assume that he means Florida schools could not profit from any offshore drilling. The fact is, Florida schools might benefit quite a bit if the state decided to allow drilling within 10 miles of its coast. States like Texas and Louisiana have reaped billions of dollars for their schools from offshore drilling leases. Texas, for example, has reaped more than $3.5 billion in revenues from offshore drilling. Most of that comes from drilling within 10 miles the coast. The money goes into an education investment fund. Every year, the state taps that fund for $800 million for public schools, said Jim Suydam, a spokesman for the Texas General Land Office. It translates to about $400 per student, and is sometimes referred to as the school's textbook fund. Texas also will get more than $35 million this year from the federal government for its share of royalties on drilling more than 10 miles offshore, he said. That money is limited to mitigation. So in fact, some gulf states have gotten quite a bit of money for their schools for allowing oil drilling off their coast. But that's mostly from drilling very close to the coast, within 10 miles. Nelson correctly specifies that the restrictions apply to federal leases. And the legislation being considered by the Senate is for drilling at least 45 miles off the western coast of Florida (in other words, entirely federal waters). We think many people might miss that distinction, however. Nelson's strongly worded statement will probably leave them with the impression that Florida couldn't get any education money from any drilling, when it could opt to do what Texas has done and use revenue from drilling within 10 miles for education. He also is extrapolating the rules from other states to apply to Florida when in fact Congress still must address how the state would be affected. And it's conceivable that Congress could change the rules for Florida or the other states, and allow that money to be spent for broader uses. So we subtract a few points and give Nelson a Mostly True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2009-06-15T17:49:30	2009-06-15	['None']

pomt-14737	Says President Barack Obama "himself has granted waivers allowing into the United States refugees who provided material support to terrorists."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/dec/18/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-incorrectly-says-obama-himself-admitte/	Texas Gov. Greg Abbott warned at a Washington, D.C. press conference that without fresh restrictions on who enters the U.S., the Islamic State could slip in attackers. Compounding "these dangers," Abbott went on, "the president himself has granted waivers allowing into the United States refugees who provided material support to terrorists." Barack Obama did that? Abbott didn’t respond to requests for backup. Meantime, we learned waivers have been granted to admit terrorist-connected refugees for about a decade though the waivers weren’t any president’s call nor is "material support" always as threatening as it might sound. A web search initially led us to a September 2015 post by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption, stating that according to a federal report, 1,519 "inadmissible" foreigners had been approved to enter the U.S. in 2014 by Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary--and more than half the candidates had provided material support to terrorists. "After a case-by-case review," Judicial Watch said, Johnson "determined that the recently admitted terrorists only participated in these activities ‘while under duress.’" Federal report to Congress The cited September 2015 report to Congress came from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency that’s part of Homeland Security. It states that Johnson, in consultation with the U.S. secretary of state and attorney general, had determined at his "sole unreviewable discretion" that restrictions in the Immigration and Nationality Act, the main federal law regulating U.S. immigration procedures, "shall not apply." The act’s section 212 (a)(3)(B) bars from entry anyone who "has engaged in" or incited "a terrorist activity" or is considered likely to do so and anyone who’s a representative or member of a terrorist group or received military training from one. It further blocks a member of a group that endorses or espouses terrorist activity unless the person can demonstrate "by clear and convincing evidence" he or she didn’t know, and shouldn’t reasonably have known, that the group was terrorist. The law also invokes material support, which "includes actions such as providing a safe house, transportation, counterfeit documents or funds to a terrorist organization or its members. It also includes any action that can assist a terrorist organization or one of its members in any way, such as providing food, helping to set up tents, distributing literature or making a small monetary contribution," USCIS sums up. The report states the 1,519 exemptions processed in the 12 months through September 2014 included 627 for an applicant’s provision of material support, "while under duress," to a terrorist organization that has never targeted U.S. interests or persons as well as 189 for giving material support, while under duress, to one of more than 50 foreign terrorist organizations designated by the Secretary of State (including Boko Haram, the Palestinian Liberation Front, Al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) or one of another 50-plus groups placed by the secretary, in accord with the USA Patriot Act of 2001, on the government’s terrorist exclusion list. See all the reasons refugees were approved for waivers here. Each waiver is handled on a case-by-case basis, the report says, "after careful review of all factors and all security checks have cleared." A Homeland Security spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, responded to our query about Abbott’s statement by stressing the government's general background checks of refugees. Waivers rooted in law Obama has no statutory role in granting the waivers, legal experts told us, while Congress has gradually widened the discretion of the secretaries of State and Homeland Security to do so. The Patriot Act, enacted shortly after the 9/11 attacks, and the REAL ID Act in 2005 included important provisions, according to a September 2015 article in the Brigham Young University Law Review, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 expanded the waiver authority of executive officials, permitting the Secretary of State in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the attorney general to waive nearly all terrorism-related exclusions built into law. Judicial Watch’s post noted a February 2014 "notice of determination" issued by the departments of State and Homeland Security stating the terrorist exclusion law "shall not apply with respect to an alien who provided limited material support" to such a group such as "certain routine commercial transactions or certain routine social transactions (i.e., in the satisfaction of certain well-established or verifiable family, social, or cultural obligations), (2) certain humanitarian assistance, or (3) substantial pressure that does not rise to the level of duress, provided, however, that the" individual is otherwise qualified for admission, has cleared background and security checks and poses no danger to the U.S., among conditions. Jennifer Daskal, an American University law professor, said the notice looks in step with existing law. Broadly, Daskal elaborated by email, Congress authorized such waivers to protect groups that could otherwise be barred from entry, such as Montagnards and Hmong, who fought alongside the U.S. during the Vietnam war from being denied visas as "material supporters of terrorism" and, Daskal said, to protect rape victims who were forced into servitude by groups like the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda from being denied visas on terrorism grounds, among problematic situations. By phone, David A. Martin, former principal deputy general counsel for Homeland Security in the Obama administration, said the waiver power was initially applied by Bush’s secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. The lawyers said Abbott’s mention of "material support" could leave the misimpression that refugees admitted by waiver pose dangers. Under the law, Martin said, even someone who provides a bowl of rice at gunpoint to a terrorist could be excluded from entering as a refugee-- absent a waiver. Wadie E. Said, professor of law at the University of South Carolina, called the "material support" part of the law "exceedingly broad," leaving no room for nuance. Our ruling Abbott said "the president himself has granted waivers allowing into the United States refugees who provided material support to terrorists." The Homeland Security secretary--not the president--grants case-by-case waivers in accord with federal law enabling people with tenuous connections to terrorist groups to be admitted as refugees. This claim ignores the fact that material support under the law doesn’t always mean someone has committed or supported violent acts. Unsaid too: The law permitting the waivers predates Obama’s presidency. We rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-04763	Says Republicans supported legislation on early voting and in-person voting in 2005.	true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/28/teresa-fedor/teresa-fedor-says-republicans-supported-ohios-earl/	With the presidential election hanging on a handful of states including Ohio, Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over the election rules and regulations governing November's election. Ohio Democrats aren't happy with Republican efforts to limit early voting, and one of the main points of contention is a GOP-backed law that eliminated in-person early voting over the final weekend before Election Day. Democrats sued in federal court to stop the law from taking effect, and held a news conference Aug. 15, 2012, outside the courthouse following an initial hearing. A key argument Democrats raised is that Republicans are attempting to trim the early voting period because they are upset that President Barack Obama used early voting to help win a key victory in Ohio in 2008. They offer as proof the fact that GOP lawmakers supported the early voting period when it was approved by state lawmakers before Obama's victory. State Rep. Teresa Fedor, a Toledo Democrat, made that very point: "Republicans voted for early voting and in-person voting back in 2005, signed 2006," Fedor told reporters. "It seems as though they are clawing back now that we've had 95,000 or more vote in 2008." Did Republicans support the early voting and in-person voting when it was passed into law before the 2008 election? PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the record. For the record, Republicans have said they merely are trying to rein in the costs of early voting and in-person voting for local boards of elections. They also point out that for the first time ever all Ohio voters will get an absentee ballot request form sent to them in the mail so having early voting just prior to Election Day isn't as needed as it used to be. But for purposes of this fact check, the question is who supported the initial law changes that enacted the early voting provisions. We turned to the office of Secretary of State Jon Husted, Ohio's chief elections official, and asked for information about when the early voting and in-person voting provisions became Ohio law. Matt McClellan, a Husted spokesman, told PolitiFact Ohio that the General Assembly passed in-person voting and early voting as part of House Bill 234. The bill establishes "no-fault" absentee voting -- meaning that those requesting absentee ballots no longer needed to give for the request -- but "also provides the option of voting in person at a Board of Elections or other site designated by the Board of Elections prior to Election Day," McClellan said in an email. The actual language for this is found in Ohio Revised Code Sec. 3509.03. It states that "when absent voter's ballots are delivered to an elector at the office of the board, the elective may retire to a voting compartment provided by the board and there mark the ballots." The bill initially passed the Ohio House on June 21, 2005. The Senate approved legislation on Oct. 18, 2005. However, the Senate substantially altered the bill in its session -- including adding the in-person early voting. The House voted to accept those changes on Oct. 19, 2005. Gov. Bob Taft signed the bill and it became law on Jan. 27, 2006. Official accounts of each chamber's vote are kept in the Ohio House and Senate Journals and they show that the Senate vote was a party-line vote of 22-10 with all 22 Senate Republicans voting for the bill and all 10 Democrats present voting against it. The second House vote -- after the early voting language had been added to the bill -- was 60 to 36. All Republicans were in support. All Democrats were opposed. News accounts of the debate show that while Democrats agreed with the legislation, they were upset that the no-fault absentee provision was being passed by GOP lawmakers just weeks before Ohioans were going to the polls to vote on a proposal to expand absentee voting opportunities. It appears as though there was no debate at the time over the provision which swung open the doors to early in-person voting. So where does this leave us? Fedor’s claim was that early voting and that Republicans have sought to limit was originally supported by Republicans. That contention is backed by records from the secretary of state's office and legislative voting records. Votes in the House and Senate were cast along party lines with Republicans supporting the measure. Democrats were in opposition, citing what they said were concerns over the timing of the measure. On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim rates True.	None	Teresa Fedor	None	None	None	2012-08-28T06:00:00	2012-08-15	['None']

pomt-14969	HIV/AIDS is "dramatically on the rise in the U.S. South."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/oct/19/elton-john/elton-john-right-south-focus-hiv-alarm/	Celebrity just keeps elbowing its way into the 2016 presidential race. It could be argued that it started with Donald Trump. The man known best to many Americans as the star of the long-running "Apprentice" reality TV show jumped into the presidential race in June and into first place in the crowded field of Republican contenders. And it continued last week in advance of the first Democratic debate. That’s when CNN decided to ask some of the rich and famous what question they’d like to put to candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. Celebrities Katy Perry and Margaret Cho said they’d pose questions about LGBT rights and the abortion/Planned Parenthood funding flap. Other headliners said they would press the candidates on the hot-button issues of gun control, jobs for the middle class and medical marijuana. Atlanta’s own part-time celebrity-in-residence -- Sir Elton John -- said his question to the candidates would be about his personal passion, the fight against HIV/AIDS. "In spite of great progress, HIV/AIDS is actually dramatically on the rise in the U.S. South. What would you do as president to help stop this epidemic, particularly among minority communities?" John said he’d ask. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, about 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and about 12.8 percent of them don’t know they’re infected. HIV/AIDS didn’t wind up a discussion point in the first Democratic debate. But PolitiFact Georgia decided John had a point worth checking. Is HIV/AIDS dramatically on the rise in the South? We began our fact-check by contacting the Elton John AIDS Foundation in New York City, asking for evidence backing up John’s statement. The foundation was quick to respond, sending us, among other things, a link to a story that appeared in The Washington Post in September 2014 under the headline "Southern States are now epicenter of HIV/AIDS in the U.S." The article quoted Rainey Campbell, then-executive director of the nonprofit Southern AIDS Coalition, as saying Southern states now have the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses, the largest percentage of people living with the disease and the most people dying from it. The foundation also sent a link to a report by the Southern HIV/AIDS Strategy Initiative (SASI) from November 2012, examining HIV epidemiology in the South using 2010 data from the CDC and other government agencies. The report focused on nine states in the South that were identified as "particularly affected by HIV" -- Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. The targeted states had the highest rates of HIV diagnoses in the United States -- 23.8 per 100,000 -- according to the CDC data, the report found. The South, the report said, makes up a third of the country’s population, but is home to more than half of the new HIV diagnoses. Nine of the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest HIV incidence rates, and seven of the 10 with the highest AIDS incidence rates, were in the targeted states, according to the report. We decided to check in ourselves with the Atlanta-based CDC to see if we could learn more. Ranking regions by the rate of new HIV diagnoses, the South is highest with 24,323 new cases, or a ratio of 20.5 per 100,00 population, based on the latest data available from 2013. Next highest is the Northeast (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont), with 8,908 new HIV diagnoses, or 15.9 per 100,000 population. The West (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming) is next with 8,013 new diagnoses, or 10.8 per 100,000 population. And the last is the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) with 6,109 new diagnosis, 9 per 100,000 population, according to the CDC. So clearly the South has a big problem. But we still weren’t sure whether any of this proved that HIV/AIDS was rising dramatically in the South. Couldn’t it be that other regions are doing a better job with education/treatment? Nic Carlisle, executive director of the Southern AIDS Coalition, said it’s likely "a combination of both." The most recent CDC surveillance report shows the country was making moderate progress until 2011, when the number of new diagnosis started moving in the wrong direction again -- with only the West showing a decrease in 2012-2013, Carlisle said. The increases were 3.4 percent in the Midwest, 3.2 percent in the Northeast, but substantially greater -- 7.5 percent for the South in 2012-2013, he said. "True, we’ve have made remarkable progress in addressing the HIV epidemic in the United States. Treatment advances have transformed what was once a fatal diagnosis into a chronic disease for many," Carlisle said. "Unfortunately, while the rest of the country reaps the benefits of this progress, the South is in danger of being left behind." Even the Obama administration recognizes the need to stem the widening HIV-related health disparities that plague the South. In its update to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), the administration set a goal of reducing disparities in the rate of new diagnoses by at least 15 percent among persons living in the Southern United States, Carlisle said. Patrick Sullivan, a professor at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health who has spent much of his career on HIV/AIDS research, said it’s true that the Southern U.S. is disproportionately impacted by HIV. The increases in new diagnoses in the South are occurring only in specific subgroups, Sullivan said. "When we look more specifically at HIV diagnoses among young, 13-24 year old, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in the South, the story is different: according to CDC data, there was a 25 percent increase in new HIV diagnoses in young gay men in the South between 2008 and 2013. For epidemiologists, this is indeed a dramatic increase," he said. "Finally, even when considering the lack of increases in HIV diagnoses in the South overall, it’s important to note that new HIV infections and new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. have both been stubbornly stable at around 45,000 to 50,000 cases each year," Sullivan said. "And in this context, the lack of substantial decreases in new HIV infections is also a dramatic public health problem." The Elton John AIDS Foundation has made 31 grants worth a combined $1.4 million aimed at addressing the South's HIV/AIDS epidemic. These includes grants worth $315,000 given out earlier this year, in partnership with The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation, to six organizations. The Equality Foundation of Georgia and the Racial Justice Action Center, both in Atlanta, were among the latest grant recipients Our ruling CDC data support the claim of superstar and part-time Atlanta resident Elton John that the South is the region most dramatically affected by the HIV epidemic. Whether that’s because cases are rising in the South or declining in other regions, or a combination of both, is not entirely a clear. Data from 2012-13 shows new HIV diagnoses on the rise in most parts of the country, with the largest -- a 7.5 percent increase -- in the South. John’s overarching point is that the South has seen an increase in AIDS/HIV, greater than any other region in the nation. The data supports that. You can quibble about whether there is enough of a trend line to term this a dramatic jump in cases. That takes his statement down a notch on the Truth-O-Meter. We rate John’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08406	"You worked hard for your money and you paid your taxes when you earned it. Now, (Indiana Republican congressional candidate) Todd Young wants to tax it again when you spend it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/21/service-employees-international-union-committee-po/seiu-blasts-indiana-gop-challenger-todd-young-over/	We've written before about a conservative proposal called the "Fair Tax," which would eliminate the federal income tax, employment tax, and estate and gift taxes and replace them with a 23 percent national sales tax. Supporters say it would reduce the cost of compliance and close loopholes. Critics counter that it would be regressive and would actually require a higher rate than the advertised 23 percent. Whatever the truth of these claims, Democrats clearly consider it a winning issue: They've used the Fair Tax as the basis for many ads against Republicans this year, one of which we recently rated Half True. We noticed the issue crop up once again in a close House contest between incumbent Democratic Rep. Baron Hill and Republican attorney Todd Young to represent a swing district in southern Indiana. Here's what caught our eye in an Oct. 20, 2010, ad placed by the political arm of the Service Employees International Union. The ad says Young, "supports a 23 percent national sales tax on everything you buy -- food and clothing, even medicine. You worked hard for your money and you paid your taxes when you earned it. Now, Todd Young wants to tax it again when you spend it. Attacking Social Security and taxing seniors twice? Indiana can't afford Todd Young." Let's start by exploring the evidence that Young supports the Fair Tax, or something like it. The issues page of Young's campaign website urges Congress to "immediately simplify our complicated tax code — and reward work, savings, and investment — by replacing the current code with either a consumption-based tax or a flatter tax." Democrats have also pointed to instances in which Young cited the Fair Tax by name, including in a North Vernon Republican debate on April 10, 2010. When we asked the Young campaign for his official position, they pointed us to an Oct. 21, 2010, article in the Jeffersonville News and Tribune in which Young said he is flexible on which tax system to use. "Young said a better approach than the Fair Tax would be a system that would give options where people could choose to stay with what they’re familiar with or go for a simpler tax code," the newspaper reported. "Whatever tax reform proposal we move towards, I have to ensure in order to get my support that it doesn’t involve raising taxes." Still, even if Young is backing off specific support for the Fair Tax, we do think there's enough evidence that he once supported it, or supported something very similar to it, to make it fair game for the SEIU. Now to the substance of the ad's charges. One issue is the ad's reference to taxing "food and clothing, even medicine." This statement is largely correct, but there's an important caveat. While the Fair Tax would indeed tax such items, it would also include a "prebate" -- an advance refund intended to cover the costs of such basic purposes. Still, the prebate would be a flat amount pegged to family size, and would not directly exempt purchases of food, clothing or medicine but would rather compensate families indirectly for a portion of the sales tax they pay. So we think the SEIU's wording is justified. But the issue in the ad that most intrigued us is the notion of double taxation. After watching a variety of ads about the Fair Tax, we had yet to see one that explicitly called the Fair Tax double taxation. And that set off alarm bells for us, since the Fair Tax, whatever you think of it as a policy, is definitely not designed to be layered on top of the current tax code. It is explicitly designed to replace the current tax code. Both PolitiFact and our friends at FactCheck.org have criticized ads that gloss over the notion that the Fair Tax would replace the current tax code. In a previous Truth-O-Meter item, we said that the absence of such context in an ad by Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., amounted to "a very deceptive omission." But not even Lincoln's ad went so far as to say, pure and simple, that the 23 percent sales tax amounted to double taxation. So we approached this ad thinking it might earn a Pants on Fire. Then we checked with the SEIU. They acknowledged that the Fair Tax would be a replacement for the current tax system. But they made an interesting point -- that for seniors, the explicit target audience for the ad, there is something that you might call double taxation. For many years, seniors paid taxes on their income when they earned it. Whatever they didn't spend, they saved, and in their retirement years, when they aren't earning fresh income that would be tax-free under the Fair Tax, those accumulated savings would be spent -- and thus taxed at 23 percent. Voila -- double taxation. To see whether this argument holds any water, we checked in with an ideological cross-section of economists. In general, they agreed that SEIU had a point. When we contacted Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, he referred us to a 2007 article he wrote in the journal Tax Notes titled, "Why the Fair Tax Won't Work." Bartlett said the proposal "penalizes those who are older who have saved for their retirement during an era when saving was heavily penalized by the income tax. But rather than being able to spend their savings tax free, as they anticipated, they will now have to pay sales taxes on everything they buy, including health care. It will be hard for them to avoid seeing this as a double tax. Bob Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, agreed that the Fair Tax double-taxes savings. "It's a transition issue that would disappear in time, once all savings held at the time of transition have been spent," Williams said. "The ad is clearly aimed at seniors, for whom the issue is definitely valid." Williams added that seniors would also fail to get much of a benefit from the Fair Tax's elimination of income tax because "most Social Security income is not subject to income tax." Dan Mitchell, a tax policy specialist at the libertarian Cato Institute, criticized the ad for leaving out the notion that the Fair Tax would replace the income tax. But he acknowledged that "there is potentially an element of truth to the secondary point about taxing seniors who earned money while young, paid income tax, saved some of the after-tax money, and now want to spend that money." Mitchell added that not all seniors would be affected equally -- it would more heavily affect seniors who had substantial savings outside of 401(k)s or other plans in which income is not taxed initially. So where does this leave us? We think SEIU makes a legitimate point that seniors -- the group that is specifically singled out for mentions in the ad's narration and in its visuals -- would face what amounts to double taxation of their savings if the Fair Tax were to pass. But we're also wary of giving this a full True rating, because we think that most viewers watching the ad would assume that the 23 percent tax would be levied on top of the existing income tax (which, we'll point out, is referenced at one point by a visual of someone filling out an IRS Form 1040). And it's simply not part of the plan for Americans to be hit by both the current tax code and the Fair Tax simultaneously. On balance, we give the ad a rating of Half True.

John Kasich is using the economic turnaround in Ohio to help make his case for president. In a recent interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, Kasich touted the state’s credit rating as part of his success story. "Guess what, our credit -- up. Think about our pensions -- solid," Kasich said. "What’s your credit rating?" Hannity asked. "It’s as high as you can get, AA+," Kasich responded. "What about AAA?" Hannity asked. "I don’t think you can really get to AAA," Kasich said, Is AA+ the highest credit rating a state could receive? That sounded dubious to us, so we wanted to investigate. For this analysis, we’re focusing on the state’s general obligation bond rating -- that is, an expert analysis of a state’s ability to pay its debts.This rating, which is kind of like a person’s credit score, is formulated by three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Neither Kasich’s campaign nor the governor’s office responded to us by our deadline. Standard and Poor’s sent PolitiFact Ohio its entire history of U.S. state ratings. The history shows when Ohio was first rated, in 1984, it earned AA, and it held there until upgrading to AA+ in 1996. S&P has an additional, forward-looking catagory for ratings which include "negative," "stable," and positive," and while Ohio has cycled through "stable" to "negative" twice in recent history (the outlook was "negative" in 2002 and again in 2009), the AA+ rating has remained unchanged for 20 years. Critical to Kasich’s claim, S&P indeed has a AAA credit rating. And several states have the highest mark. Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming -- are all rated AAA, according to S&P. Three of those states -- Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia -- have held their perfect scores for 50 years or more. For the record, Moody’s and Fitch also issues AAA ratings. Don Chance, a professor of finance at Louisiana State University, said it’s impressive for a state government to maintain a positive credit rating in difficult economic times. But, on the merits of the claim, Kasich is clearly mistaken. "I think he probably got caught up in the moment, caught up reeling off the bullet points," Chance said, noting that Kasich previously worked at Lehman Brothers. Our ruling Kasich said on Fox News that his state of Ohio earned the highest possible credit rating, at AA+.

pomt-14094	Says Katie McGinty "actually agrees with Hillary Clinton and the most liberal wing of the Democrats on everything."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/16/pat-toomey/pat-toomey-says-katie-mcginty-agrees-hillary-clint/	Correction appended During a recent broadcast of Dom Giordano’s Philadelphia talk radio show on 1210AM, as Buzzfeed reported, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., called it outrageous that Democratic nominee Katie McGinty tied him to GOP Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. The two have wasted no time battling it out ever since McGinty won the Democratic primary April 26 to take on Toomey in the general election. As a comeback, Toomey compared McGinty’s campaign stances to those of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. "She actually agrees with Hillary Clinton and the most liberal wing of the Democrats on everything," said Toomey. We reached out to Toomey’s campaign for more background. "The only times McGinty has publicly deviated from the Obama and Clinton agenda are when she's gone even further to the left, like embracing Bernie Sanders-style single-payer healthcare and defending sanctuary cities," Communications Director Ted Kwong said to PolitiFact PA in an email statement. Many observers would dispute aligning Clinton with party’s most liberal faction. Nevertheless, we looked through issues backed by two candidates, and we found that Toomey’s claim doesn’t hold up entirely. Sure, there are plenty of things McGinty and Clinton agree on. Both cite a need for good-paying jobs and strengthening America’s clean energy economy — just two examples out of many. But, we haven’t found evidence to prove that Clinton and McGinty agree on each issue. Actually, we were able to find a couple on which their views don’t align. One of Clinton’s big campaign issues is that "climate change is an urgent threat," and she says we need to "invest in clean energy innovations." McGinty has the same stance. However, when you look at fracking, McGinty’s views set her apart from much of the party. Clinton’s position has evolved some, but at present she believes fracking should only be permitted if the local residents approve. McGinty on the other hand thinks, with proper taxation and regulation, fracking should get the green light. The two democratic nominees also have had very different histories with free trade. Clinton’s position on NAFTA is complicated, to say the least. When Bill Clinton first signed the agreement into law in 1993, Hillary Clinton publicly supported it, but that support has waned over time. She most recently publicly backed NAFTA in her autobiography written in 2003 and in a teleconference that took place in 2004. Since that time, Clinton has not made public statements defending the free trade agreement. In fact, in 2008 Clinton called herself a "critic of NAFTA from the very beginning." In reality, Clinton’s public position on NAFTA has certainly shifted over the past few years. McGinty’s stance on NAFTA has also evolved, but her present position is much less convoluted. In a democratic debate live from the University Park campus of Penn State last month, McGinty called NAFTA "something that hasn’t worked in 30 years." So, it’s not the case to say that the two candidates agree on everything. It would be more accurate to say they share the vast majority of issues that they’ve endorse publicly. This is pretty common in Democratic races. In the lead-up to the primary, polling expert G. Terry Madonna told TribLive that McGinty differed little in stances from her fellow Democratic candidates, John Fetterman and Joe Sestak. "This campaign is about personalities and style," Madonna said. "On 100 issues in the Senate, these candidates would probably vote the same way on 98 of them. I don't think the issues are as defining as who these candidates are." Richardson Dilworth, director of the Center for Public Policy at Drexel University, argued that campaign stances aren’t always directly representative of a candidate’s personal beliefs, but of the campaign’s stakeholders, of the constituencies the politician is aiming to attract. Looking beyond established platforms, two candidates can differ on more than their common planks would suggest. "There’s a distinction between [Clinton’s] personal opinions and what she promises as a candidate. Those two things don’t have to agree. There’s no reason to expect that she’s going to have the same personal opinions as she would have about positions she publicly takes because the positions she has to take as a candidate are going to be negotiations among many stakeholders," Dilworth said. Dilworth thinks McGinty’s and Clinton’s strong similarities are no coincidence, though. "Pennsylvania is, to a certain extent, representative of the country, more so than many other states," said Dilworth. "In that respect, McGinty will be making a lot of the same pitches as Hillary Clinton because she’s going for the same kinds of voters." Our ruling Senator Pat Toomey stated that Katie McGinty agrees with Hillary Clinton on everything. After closer inspection, it has become clear that although McGinty and Clinton share similar positions on many issues, there are a couple of significant instances where their opinions differ. Furthermore, many of their shared opinions can be attributed to the similarities in their intended audiences. McGinty and Clinton have expressed similar public opinions on many issues, but it wouldn’t be wholly accurate to say that they agree with each other on everything. We rate the claim Half True. An earlier version of this story characterized Katie McGinty's views on fracking as in line with Bernie Sanders. This is inaccurate. As the article describes, she is pro-fracking, provided taxes and fair regulation are in place. Sanders is decidedly anti-fracking.

pomt-00428	Says the "South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers" and alleges a "large scale killing of farmers" in the country.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/24/donald-trump/trump-tweets-incorrect-south-african-land-seizures/	Fox News host Tucker Carlson and President Donald Trump are among a group of U.S. conservatives raising alarm bells about something happening half a world away in South Africa. "The president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, has begun ... seizing land from his own citizens without compensation because they are the wrong skin color," Tucker began his show Aug. 22. "That is literally the definition of racism." Trump chimed in soon thereafter on Twitter, tagging accounts for both Carlson and Fox News and going even further to decry murders of farmers. Trump said that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate "the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s statement that the South African government is "seizing land from white farmers" is misleading. As for his claim that there is "large scale killing of farmers" in the country, that is flat-out wrong. A brief history of South African reparations South Africa is a country marred by its long history of racial discrimination. From 1948 until 1994, the country lived under apartheid rule; members of different races were forbidden from interacting, and black South Africans were forced under law to live in much worse conditions than white citizens. In 1959, the government required many black landowners to give up their property and rent homes with white landlords. Over the course of apartheid, non-white families lost their homes and lands. When apartheid ended in the mid 1990s, the government passed measures to help black South Africans to recover from decades of discrimination and abuse. The effects of apartheid still reverberate through the country, especially when it comes to a distribution of land: 72 percent of farmland in South Africa is owned by white people, while whites make up about 9 percent of the population. Selling or seizing? One of the reparations, first passed in 1994, is the Restitution of Land Rights Act. Under this law, black families and communities who had property taken from them before or during apartheid can file a claim for it. The government and current landowners negotiate for the area. If they cannot reach a compromise, the government can use expropriation -- the power of the state to take land for the public good. On Aug. 19, South Africa’s restitutions policy made headlines when the government moved ahead with plans to buy a hunting retreat. The current owners, the Akkerland Boerdery company, say that the government offered them only 10 percent of the market value for their property. In the Restitution of Land Rights Act, the land reform minister is given the right to expropriate land that rightfully belongs to another group. However, the act also says that the compensation for that land is to be determined "either by agreement or by the Court." The owners of Akkerland, who did not agree to the government’s offer, said they had been denied the opportunity to argue in court. The ruling party in South Africa, the African National Congress, has been working to make land expropriation easier for the government. Most notably, they plan to begin allowing the government to take land without offering compensation to speed up the restitution of land ownership to black South Africans. A leading ANC chairman also created controversy in July, when he said that farmers with more than 25,000 acres should have land taken from them. Back to Trump Trump’s framing about the South African government "seizing land from white farmers" omits critical context and leaves the wrong impression. The South African government is not seizing land of white farmers. Instead, they are negotiating with white farmers to buy back land that had been wrongfully taken from black communities during apartheid. The government is considering changing the constitution so they can acquire the land without paying the current owners. However, in every exchange made so far, they have paid current owners for their property loss. The government has not taken steps to limit farmers to 25,000 acres. Farmer danger Now to the second part of Trump’s tweet: the "large-scale killing" of South African farmers. The statistics on this are nebulous. Our partner Africa Check concluded in May that there were significant roadblocks to identifying the rate of farm murders. To calculate a rate, one would need the number of murders, and divide that by the total number of farmers. However, the murder rate could include anyone visiting or working on a farm, not just farm owners. Additionally, there are no accurate estimates of farms or farmers in the country. Africa Check determined that it is "near impossible" to determine an accurate murder rate for farmers. Calculated based solely on a 2007 commercial agriculture census, the rate is about 100 per 100,000 farmers. But when all farm-related personnel are accounted for, rather than just full-time commercial farmers, the rate is much lower: only 5.6 murders per 100,000 farmers. If you count every person involved in agriculture, even those who don’t live on farms, the rate would drop even further, to 0.4 murders per 100,000. That being said, the police in South Africa have been tracking the number of farm attacks and murders over the last two decades. According to their statistics, there were 47 farm murders in the 2017-18 financial year. According to Africa Check, the South African police did not collect statistics on attacks and murders on farms and smallholdings prior to 1997. So, there is not conclusive evidence to say that farmers are more likely to be killed than anyone else in the country. There is also no way to determine how many recent murders were motivated by racial tensions. Dr. Johan Burger, a researcher for South Africa’s Institute for Security Studies, told the Australian Broadcasting Company fact-checkers that farm attacks may be partially motivated by the isolation of farmers; because their land is further away from neighbors and police stations, they may be easier to rob. It’s hard to say what Trump meant by "large-scale killing." However, based on the limited amount of information we have, it is inaccurate. Farm murders have been declining over time, according to police reports. Our ruling Trump tweeted that the "South African government is seizing land from white farmers" and that there has been a "large scale killing of farmers" in the country. The government of South Africa is pursuing reparations more aggressively. When black communities file a claim for stolen land, the government has been offering fair market value to encourage white owners to sell. Now, the government is considering taking land without compensating current owners. Only land which had been unfairly taken from black communities through discriminatory laws is considered for redistribution. What’s more wrong in Trump’s observation is that South African farmers are not being killed systematically due to their race or profession. There is not enough data to say whether the rate of farmer deaths has increased significantly, and nothing tying that directly to government reparations initiatives. We rate this statement Mostly False. Correction (Aug. 28, 2018): The South African police did not collect statistics on attacks and murders on farms and smallholdings prior to 1997.

pomt-12669	"I remember years ago looking at a CBO report that in 1964 predicted that Medicare would cost $9 billion 10 years later. And I think it was already over $100 billion at that point."	false	/georgia/statements/2017/mar/20/jack-kingston/did-cbo-exist-1964-no/	House Republicans have been moving on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. One of the big controversies surrounding the repeal concerns how many people will lose health insurance coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently issued a forecast that 24 million fewer people would have coverage by 2024. Repeal supporters, though, have focused on how difficult it is to estimate a concrete number involving the replacement for Obamacare. Former U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia made that case on CNN on March 12. "Well, a CBO in 2010 said that 24 million people would be covered by exchanges by now under Obamacare. That number is 10 million. They were 14 million people off," Kingston said. "I remember years ago looking at the CBO report that in 1964, it was predicted that Medicare would cost $9 billion 10 years later. And I think it was already over $100 billion at that point." Kingston claimed that he saw a 1964 CBO report that got Medicare wrong, but there’s a major flaw in this statement: The CBO wasn’t formed until 1974. According to the agency’s own history, the CBO began operating on Feb. 24, 1975, with Alice Rivlin appointed as the first director. Its mission was and is to provide carefully researched, independent budget and economic information to Congress. The CBO was created by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which was sparked by conflict between the legislative and executive branches. Back then, members of Congress objected to President Richard Nixon’s threats of impoundment. In this case, Nixon had refused to spend money on projects he opposed, even though Congress had appropriated the money. The 1974 law affirmed Congress’ constitutional control over the budget by establishing new procedures for controlling impoundments. The law also created new legislative institutions to implement the new congressional budget process: the House and Senate Budget Committees to oversee execution of the budget process, and the Congressional Budget Office to provide the budget committees and Congress with objective, impartial information about budgetary and economic issues. So Kingston was wrong about the CBO. In response to our questions, Kingston acknowledged the error but said he was thinking of a different source. He provided a 2009 article from the Washington Times about the U.S. health plans having a history of cost overruns. "In 1965, the House Ways and Means Committee estimated that the hospital insurance program of Medicare - the federal health care program for the elderly and disabled - would cost $9 billion by 1990. The actual cost that year was $67 billion," the article said. A 1965 New York Times article explained the new Medicare plan. The new version would include doctors’ fees and drugs, as well as hospitalization. The Washington Post Fact Checker has looked in depth at the old estimates about Medicare. It found that Medicare’s costs were underestimated back in the 1960s, but that nominal dollar figures aren't the best way to look at the program, due to inflation in the 1970s. Our ruling Kingston said, "I remember years ago looking at a CBO report that in 1964 predicted that Medicare would cost $9 billion 10 years later. And I think it was already over $100 billion." But the CBO wasn't established until 1974. There were estimates, but they were actually made by the House Ways and Means Committee. Comparing the original figures to today is more complicated than just citing the numbers. And the sources for the figures -- the CBO vs. a House committee -- are very different. When we asked about the misstatement, Kingston acknowledged the error. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08121	In the case of a catastrophic event, the Atlanta-area offices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will self-destruct.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/dec/10/walking-dead/hit-series-shows-cdc-blows-after-zombie-apocalypse/	OK, OK, enough of that political stuff. The winter holidays approach. State politicians are hibernating. Now PolitiFact Georgia' staff can investigate what's really important. Is there a doomsday plan for Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention? "Huh?" you ask. And "Why?" Because of AMC's hit series "The Walking Dead." Flesh-eating zombies take over Atlanta, and in Sunday's season finale, survivors who take refuge at the CDC find out things are even worse than they thought: The building is locked down and rigged to explode. When the CDC's generators run out of fuel, a two-stage device more powerful than anything known to mankind short of a nuclear bomb will blow it to kingdom come. "It sets the air on fire," fictional CDC scientist Dr. Edwin Jenner said. "No pain. An end to sorrow, grief, regret. Everything." Thirty minutes later, KAAABOOOOM!!!! No more CDC. Really? Don't laugh. PolitiFact Georgia readers and more than a few Atlanta Journal-Constitution staffers asked PolitiFact to check whether the CDC has an endgame plan. "The Walking Dead" follows survivors of a plague that turns people into zombies. In the show's post-apocalypse Atlanta, the undead lurch down Marietta Street and through the countryside hungry for human innards. The Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre stands in as the CDC's stunt double. "The Walking Dead" is by far the most popular show shot in Atlanta, according to ajc.com's Radio & TV Talk blog. It averaged 5 million viewers during the fall season, which is 2 million more than second-place Bravo's "The Real Housewives of Atlanta." This makes it the most popular drama in basic-cable history among the coveted 18- to 49-year-old demographic. And when a show this popular turns a major DeKalb County employer into a smoldering pit of rubble, AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers take notice. We called the CDC. Officials there said the agency was not consulted during production of the show. While the agency does have safeguards in case generators fail, a subnuclear blast is not one of them, spokeswoman Karen Hunter said. "We do have systems in place, but none of them involve explosives," Hunter said. The CDC has safeguards for a variety of emergencies, but they don't specifically address the possibility of the end of humanity. "We do not have a doomsday scenario at the CDC," Hunter said. If for some reason the CDC were unable to operate from its main campus, designated employees would travel to another location and work from there, Hunter said. Backup generators have failed at least twice in recent years. In June 2007, lightning knocked out power at the CDC's $214 million infectious disease building -- including the agency's six high-tech labs designed to contain Ebola, smallpox, avian influenza and other killer bugs. In July 2008, a bird shorted out a Georgia Power transformer, cutting off power to part of the CDC's main campus. Critics worried the generator failures showed the lab was unsafe. The Government Accountability Office investigated. While "The Walking Dead's" CDC seemed to use fire as a kind of disinfectant, the real CDC typically uses other cleaning methods. In the second-to-last episode, Jenner accidentally spills a caustic chemical as he works in a lab, which automatically decontaminates by setting itself on fire. In reality, CDC scientists disinfect spills with some very uncinematic household products, said Tom Skinner, another CDC spokesman. "Lysol and bleach," Skinner said. Materials used to clean the spill are burned, but not by a self-immolating lab. They use incinerators. Scientists work with dangerous pathogens in rooms with negative airflow to prevent germs from leaking outside. Air entering and leaving those rooms is scrubbed with filters. Scientists wear protective suits. While we are disappointed to find that real life is not nearly as cinematic as fiction, we walk away from our effort heartened. We are pleased to reassure the CDC's neighbors that they do not need to install flame-proof siding. The CDC said none of its emergency plans involve blowing up its campus. Plus, the AJC reported two cases in which the CDC emergency generator failures did not coincide with subnuclear explosions. We rule "The Walking Dead" claim Pants On Fire. And by the way, we can't wait for Season 2.	None	The Walking Dead	None	None	None	2010-12-10T06:00:00	2010-12-05	['Atlanta_metropolitan_area']
pomt-00415	Says Beto O’Rourke "voted against" Hurricane Harvey "tax relief."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-beto-orourke-voted-against-tax-relie/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz says in an online video ad that he voted for tax relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 as his Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, ridiculously voted "no." The narrator of Cruz’s August 2018 ad, which features photos of water rescues and Cruz on the scene of the devastating hurricane, says: "Congressman O’Rourke is so irresponsible that he even voted against hurricane tax relief." A House roll call shows that O’Rourke, a congressman since 2013, was among 155 representatives to vote against the House’s Sept. 28, 2017, passage of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, for which 264 members, including 43 Democrats, cast "yea" votes. The same day, the House concurred with a Senate amendment to the proposal and two days later President Donald Trump signed that into law. The measure folded in tax relief for hurricane victims. A September 2017 Houston Chronicle news story on the action, crediting Cruz with leading the effort to pass the legislation, said key provisions--approved two weeks after Congress advanced more than $15 billion in aid to Harvey victims--would permit Harvey victims to access their retirement funds penalty-free, allow victims to easily write off hurricane losses and provide a tax credit of up to $6,000 for employers who hire in a declared disaster area like Harris County, home to hard-hit Houston. Also, the story said, charitable giving might be spurred by the measure's waiving of deduction limits. Also, the proposal included language allowing taxpayers to use income from the past year to determine the Earned Income Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit, the story said. O'Rourke voted for direct aid When we asked O’Rourke’s campaign about his "no" vote, spokesman Chris Evans replied by email that O’Rourke, who otherwise voted for direct hurricane relief, voted against the measure singled out by Cruz "because it dramatically shortchanged Harvey victims by providing significantly smaller tax breaks than those given after Hurricane Sandy," which slammed the East Coast in 2012. Hold that comparison: The American Institute of CPAs put us in touch with a Louisiana expert, CPA Jerry Schreiber, who told us by phone that Congress didn’t provide tax breaks to victims of Hurricane Sandy. Another congressional roll-call vote shows that earlier, on Sept. 25, 2017, O’Rourke joined a sufficient number of House members to keep the act from being immediately considered and passed by the House. O'Rourke's explanation for opposition to tax-relief legislation After that vote, O’Rourke posted a statement saying that he supported the measure’s main thrust--reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration and programs set to expire that week--but voted against the House moving along because "other initiatives that are critical to the livelihood of our families and neighbors in El Paso were excluded." O’Rourke’s statement went on: "Without returning this legislation for further improvement, I am not confident Congress would have reauthorized these programs. "For example, H.R. 3823 left out reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers only days before their funding is set to expire. The recent debate on health care in our country has only reinforced the need for quality, affordable care. That simply will not be possible without these two programs that so many children and families in El Paso rely on. "Additionally, the bill would have left victims of recent natural disasters — including Hurricane Harvey — without sufficient assistance as they work to recover and rebuild. The bill provided help in the form of tax breaks at a much lower rate than those provided to victims of both Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina. "Ultimately, H.R. 3823 failed to pass the House. With less than a week remaining to reauthorize the FAA, CHIP, and Community Health Centers, I urge my colleagues to pass an improved version of this legislation that extends these programs while ensuring that we continue to aid those recovering from Harvey and other recent natural disasters." Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke irresponsibly voted against tax relief for Hurricane Harvey victims. O’Rourke voted against the proposal delivering tax relief though Cruz's statement, suggesting a didn't-care attitude, leaves unsaid that O’Rourke offered some reasons for his opposition and had voted for direct aid to victims.
